I also have some concerns over the potential for social unrest should the current measures be required to be in place for longer or require tightening.  I worry that this has the potential to impact our democratic way of life in the medium term.

I have severe asthma so I am a bit worried about getting it because I have a high risk of needing ventilation and of dying from it. Staying in really isn't an issue for me. I have been living with chronic illness since I was 12 and at my worst I was housebound for 2 years as a teenager so this is nothing compared to that. It has actually been annoying and anger inducing to see so many people complain about the lockdown and staying in, especially if they are middle class/rich with nothing to really worry about, when I have been through worse and was completely ignored and forgotten about like so many others and the key workers are going through much worse too. People are finally experiencing what it is like to live as a disabled person where you have to cancel and grieve for events, stay in for days at a time and survive on what little money the government decides is enough for a week. But still these people can go out and exercise and we still can't. It is also very anger-inducing to see so many people flaunt the rules and go out for BBQs and sunbathing. Also plenty of people going out for 'exercise' are gathering in groups and not observing the 2-meter distance with strangers. I also find it sad that the scientific literacy is so poor in this country. People really don't understand simple things that are being told to them about how the virus works, the symptoms, when to self isolate and what the lockdown means. People are dying every day because of this stupidity. There are also way too many stupid people trying to take down 5G masts because they are transmitting the virus. There are no words for that level. I find there is a bit of toxic positivity and toxic productivity on facebook and social media in general. Like people sharing the numbers of recovered to focus on the positives because everyone else is talking about how many died when these deaths matter. It isn't just the flu. A few days ago a 13 year old died alone and now he has been buried alone with no funeral. I don't want to hear about the recovered because that shouldn't be the focus and people need to be more scared and panicked so they stay indoors and don't get complacent. There should be video from the ICUs on the TV every night to make people think. Many of my friends are taking up new hobbies and getting round to decluttering and finishing those jobs around the house you never end up doing. This is great for them and I am happy they can have some time where they aren't burned out by work constantly but it makes me feel bad because I can't do that. Being as ill as I am is like a full time job and my spare energy goes on cooking, showering and if I am lucky cleaning. I had a migraine yesterday and the most I managed to do was water my plants. I won't be joining my friends in fun creative pursuits and making my space nicer to live in during the lockdown.   I have had some darker thoughts too that maybe we deserve this. I don't believe in any higher power or some personification of mother nature but this has revealed the true nature of humanity in the west. When this started at first people just got really racist ranging from joking about Kung Flu to actually beating up ethnically Chinese people who may never have been to China. Then there was the panic buying of everyone for themselves and protecting their own and screw the rest. A week later I saw images of bins filled with rotting food they had over-purchased whilst elderly and disabled people went hungry because there was nothing in the shops or they couldn't book an online slot. Panic buying continued at pharmacies and now people are short on necessary prescription medication. And now there are people breaking social distancing for selfish reasons like when everyone treated it like a bank holiday and went to Mount Snowdon or just didn't bother because they would be fine if they got the virus. No care about those of us who are the worst affected. Even my aunt who is a nurse went out whilst having the virus to get shopping and medication and could have spread it to many more. It is just a shame that this virus disproportionately affects the elderly and sick and doesn't target selfish and stupid people instead. Now my main worry is about the antibody test because the government wants to get the country and the economy going because money matters most and will possibly allow those who are immune back to work and leave the rest of us behind. It could be that the healthy and young can go back to work and I will still be left behind until there is a vaccine. I really can't risk my life and will lose even more of it than I already have to illness if most people go back to normal. Right now everyone has been dragged nearer to my level so for me that feels okay and something I can live with. My friends are doing virtual socials and chatting online more when usually I have to cancel party invitations and skip nights out. I do have an academic interest in this too as I studied infectious diseases before so it has been frustrating to see the government go against a lot of public health research but interesting to read the latest articles on the biology of the virus.

I feel like the science is unclear because we do not have enough information, and that we (our governments) are not equipped to make the best decisions because they do not have the wherewithal to improve their information very quickly. I feel that there's a desire to 'do the right thing', but that the consequences and impacts of the choices being made are not clearly understood. I feel like we're being held hostage by an 'enemy' that, while dangerous for a proportion of society, may prove to be significantly less formidable than thought with the benefit of hindsight. I feel like our personal and physical connections are a huge part of what defines our humanity, and that restricting them has hidden consequences, particularly for those who are vulnerable with mental health difficulties. I feel that - despite our being aware that pandemics are increasingly likely in our world, thanks to our global economy, the effectiveness of medicine in treating 'regular' diseases, etc. - we as a society were under-prepared, preferring to not spend the necessary money to protect us better. I feel like there's a lack of understanding of the difficulties inherent in preventing viral spread, but also an over-reaction in policing people's lives and the sacrifice of personal liberty. I feel depressed that this unprecedented situation will likely be used as an excuse/justification for issues in the future, and may hamper our ability to tackle other pressing problems in the world. I feel concerned that my reaction to the situation hasn't been the same as others, and that I am finding it hard to not be overwhelmed by the frustration. I am glad of my 17 mile commute through pretty countryside, and the requirement (as a 'key' worker) for me to be at work, which has helped support my own mental health, something that has been fragile for many years. I am depressed that I'm not in a more significant role, able to better help people in need. I am bothered by the fact that the 'lockdown' has shown how barren my life is, but that I feel no ability to alter it, either now, or at the end of the current situation. I feel I'm struggling to properly engage with some of the more positive things that are happening - communities pulling together, activities online, reinforcements of ties between friends. I feel like social media, and the internet is proving both it's strengths and it's weaknesses at being a place to share both good and bad information, to make good and bad connections. I feel like the cost of this will be high, monetarily and otherwise, and that it may become a driver of division and conflict rather than a potential driver for change.

I’m not so concerned about my own health, more for family and friends and frontline workers. I think that the lack of proper protection equipment for NHS workers is depressing and worrying. I think the Government have an unprecedented task, but they seemed lacklustre to begin with and the regulations are not being enforced.
I think some people think they’re invincible and are not worried about the health of others. This is causing the spread and is very worrying to me. I’m also concerned that if we have to self isolate, there are no supermarket delivery slots. I understand why a lot of these have been reserved for vulnerable people, but then how do those who  have to self isolate access food?",1.273,585.251,591.16,16,"Please stay home to keep us all alive ",3.06,7.297,17.941,2,5,3,7,2,2,1,"Yes",149,796,8,38,"en","en",1123,15,0.02,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I am going to the shop in place of my parents to keep them inside and keep them safe, but it doesn't really help because if I get it by going outside I will spread to them as we live in the same house. So you feel like you can't do right from wrong. It makes me worried that my parents could get ill because I know for sure that one of them probably couldn't survive it. I don't think I could cope if they died alone in hospital. I am worried about the future because I feel like there's a very high chance my world could come crashing down in the next couple of months. 
I have started a new job and I want to just be getting on with it normally. I'm also worried because I have no employment protection because I have not been there long enough. Even if I was furloughed I wouldn't be paid because I started after 28 Feb.
