I go to work daily in the NHS seeing patients on wards and in the out patients department, not knowing if my colleagues or myself will get this virus. We can only do our best by trying to distance ourselves and hand wash/sanitise but this is difficult when you have to take a blood sample off someone.

People need to remember how serious this is, and keep their distance and not go out.

I haven't left the house since 15th march and it's boring but I'm very happy with staying in if it means I am safe. my biggest concern is that the government will ease restrictions too early - in order to try and save the dying economy they could put us all at risk of an even deadlier second wave. I am in my early 20s and I haven't received a letter about my vulnerable status from the NHS, which is absurd since despite my age I am very at risk and the asmtha uk guidelines say i should be included with the shielding group. I think the government has included the very bare minimum of people in the extremely vulnerable category in order to only just cover their backs.

I am truly fearful that we might be restricted from travelling for years into the future. The uncertainty is what is getting to me the most.

I am getting so frustrated with the lockdown and how it has destroyed my business and left me feeling really lonely and anxious, depressed etc. Eventually, there will come a time when we have to leave our houses and I am beginning to wonder whether we will ever have this virus under control.

Specifically the impact of the virus remaining the population and the potential for repeat outbreaks with resultant loss of life. I am also very concerned about the longer term impact on the economy, the impact of the government stimulus will have on future government spending, social support and tax requirements.  In particular I’m concerned that further rounds of austerity may be required, or that inflationary or deflationary pressures may arise which require further government intervention which may further impact our way of life.  Fundamentally I’m worried how the current situation may impact it will have on the world in which my children will grow up.
I also have some concerns over the potential for social unrest should the current measures be required to be in place for longer or require tightening.  I worry that this has the potential to impact our democratic way of life in the medium term.  
I guess I also have concerns about how governments have reacted to the situation and the potential for the rise of nationalism.
Lots to worry about and probably a bit depressing now I think about it.

There is a lot of uncertainty at this moment in time, and although I know we will get through this, it’s scary to see what the world will look like on the other side. It’s tough to know that things will probably get worse before they get better and this may take some time.

Also there is the uncertainty of not knowing what the government will do and how much limitations they will place on us.

It’s also interesting to see how nature is taking a big breather from the impact we as humans have on the world and if there are no flights, factories shut, and less people consuming energy without reason then there could be a positive impact on nature and global warming, which at least would be a good by product from this uncertain and depressing times. Hopefully this will end and people will get used to the new normality but we can be more positive and open to each other and pool together globally for the better.

I am also angry at the government because not enough people are being tested especially frontline workers like doctors, nurses, pharmacists and parademics, bus drivers and supermarket workers etc. They also don't have enough PPE to protect themselves therefore frontline workers are dying because of inadequate protection.","Anxious, sad and angry regarding this covid19 situation.

What's happening in the world is horrible, there's no doubt about that, it incredibly sad to see and hear of so many deaths in the world because of this awful disease and I really do hope that we find a way to contain/cure this soon and save as many lives as possible.

Looking for a silver lining, however, I'm working from home and my mental health has massively improved because of it. My day usually involves waking at 5am, driving 30 miles to work usually stressing out in traffic, and once I get to work I'm tired before I've even started, then I have to do it again in the evening, usually getting home late in the evening, not having time to cook properly because I just want a few hours on the couch to switch off before I have to go to bed and get up at 5am again.
With my current working from home situation, I'm getting twice as much sleep as I normally do (usually only get around 4 or 5 hours tops), I'm not stressed and tired from driving for over an hour, I'm able to switch off at a reason time in the early evening and actually cook healthier meals, spend more time with my partner etc.
So although the whole reason we're in this mess is awful, by being forced to stay home and work, my mental and physical health has hugely improved.","Praying for all of the family affected by this awful disease, and that we find a cure soon.

We are still hurtling towards runaway global warming, and that is a collective insanity by any reasonable definition. The reduction in air pollution is also double edged. There is a phenomena called Global Dimming (which is in the IPCC report), where the pollution layer is blocking about 1 degree of extra warming about that pollution layer that has already occurred. The reduction of that pollution layer removes that reduction, and will potentially push us to the edge of runaway global warming. Global Dimming should be discussed.

I'm worried that my more vulnerable (in health) family members will become sick.
I'm irritated by the UK lock-down measures and social-distancing guidelines.
I'm angry at how people are panic-buying and over-reacting on certain things.
I'm angry at how the prices of hand-sanitizer and disinfectant, products I've regularly had to buy and use for years due to pre-existing health-issues, are now sky-high or impossible to find.
I'm worried about the economy and how it'll affect me and mine.
I'm worried that pets can become hosts, become ill, or become vectors for infection, and I'm angry because that implies nothing natural about the virus' origins.
I'll reiterate, and to be crude: fuck China. It's their fault, be it through abominable cultural and hygiene practices (mixing bush-meat with domestically-sourced meat in wet markets) or being as competent as Soviet nuclear researchers were in the 1940's with biological research/development, if the virus was engineered in someway, for some purpose.","Worried about the future, and if it'll make my vulnerable family-members ill or worse. #FuckChina","9","6","9","2","2","1","Yes"

I have severe asthma so I am a bit worried about getting it because I have a high risk of needing ventilation and of dying from it. Staying in really isn't an issue for me. I have been living with chronic illness since I was 12 and at my worst I was housebound for 2 years as a teenager so this is nothing compared to that. It has actually been annoying and anger inducing to see so many people complain about the lockdown and staying in, especially if they are middle class/rich with nothing to really worry about, when I have been through worse and was completely ignored and forgotten about like so many others and the key workers are going through much worse too. People are finally experiencing what it is like to live as a disabled person where you have to cancel and grieve for events, stay in for days at a time and survive on what little money the government decides is enough for a week. But still these people can go out and exercise and we still can't. It is also very anger-inducing to see so many people flaunt the rules and go out for BBQs and sunbathing. Also plenty of people going out for 'exercise' are gathering in groups and not observing the 2-meter distance with strangers. I also find it sad that the scientific literacy is so poor in this country. People really don't understand simple things that are being told to them about how the virus works, the symptoms, when to self isolate and what the lockdown means. People are dying every day because of this stupidity. There are also way too many stupid people trying to take down 5G masts because they are transmitting the virus. There are no words for that level. I find there is a bit of toxic positivity and toxic productivity on facebook and social media in general. Like people sharing the numbers of recovered to focus on the positives because everyone else is talking about how many died when these deaths matter. It isn't just the flu. A few days ago a 13 year old died alone and now he has been buried alone with no funeral. I don't want to hear about the recovered because that shouldn't be the focus and people need to be more scared and panicked so they stay indoors and don't get complacent. There should be video from the ICUs on the TV every night to make people think. Many of my friends are taking up new hobbies and getting round to decluttering and finishing those jobs around the house you never end up doing. This is great for them and I am happy they can have some time where they aren't burned out by work constantly but it makes me feel bad because I can't do that. Being as ill as I am is like a full time job and my spare energy goes on cooking, showering and if I am lucky cleaning. I had a migraine yesterday and the most I managed to do was water my plants. I won't be joining my friends in fun creative pursuits and making my space nicer to live in during the lockdown.   I have had some darker thoughts too that maybe we deserve this. I don't believe in any higher power or some personification of mother nature but this has revealed the true nature of humanity in the west. When this started at first people just got really racist ranging from joking about Kung Flu to actually beating up ethnically Chinese people who may never have been to China. Then there was the panic buying of everyone for themselves and protecting their own and screw the rest. A week later I saw images of bins filled with rotting food they had over-purchased whilst elderly and disabled people went hungry because there was nothing in the shops or they couldn't book an online slot. Panic buying continued at pharmacies and now people are short on necessary prescription medication. And now there are people breaking social distancing for selfish reasons like when everyone treated it like a bank holiday and went to Mount Snowdon or just didn't bother because they would be fine if they got the virus. No care about those of us who are the worst affected. Even my aunt who is a nurse went out whilst having the virus to get shopping and medication and could have spread it to many more. It is just a shame that this virus disproportionately affects the elderly and sick and doesn't target selfish and stupid people instead. Now my main worry is about the antibody test because the government wants to get the country and the economy going because money matters most and will possibly allow those who are immune back to work and leave the rest of us behind. It could be that the healthy and young can go back to work and I will still be left behind until there is a vaccine. I really can't risk my life and will lose even more of it than I already have to illness if most people go back to normal. Right now everyone has been dragged nearer to my level so for me that feels okay and something I can live with. My friends are doing virtual socials and chatting online more when usually I have to cancel party invitations and skip nights out. I do have an academic interest in this too as I studied infectious diseases before so it has been frustrating to see the government go against a lot of public health research but interesting to read the latest articles on the biology of the virus. I am probably one of the few who is not getting scared at reading about the virus itself even though I am susceptible to it","To everyone complaining about the lockdown and wanting to go and sunbathe: Stop being so selfish.

However, this can also be a blessing in disguise to me. I study French language and have been able to focus more on my studies now that I’m stuck at home. I feel on top of things for once and feel like I can catch up and keep up on all of my work as I’m doing it in my own time while also to deadlines. It’s a very contradictory time for my emotional and mental state but for everything else it is frustrating as I love being outside. However, it is selfish of others to go out when realistically that’s what’s making COVID-19 and it’s spread worse.

I fear that combined with Brexit, this unprecedented situation will completely topple our economy and it will be difficult to recover. I already had economic worries before COVID-19 and those worries have been exacerbated by the closure of businesses and rising unemployment. The pandemic has struck global markets to an unprecedented level and, without being a member of the EU anymore, a lack of trade could quickly become a serious problem affecting the UK's recovery.

I feel a little bit angry/resentful towards people whom haven't taken it seriously or whom have been ignoring the lockdown, and thus putting themselves and most importantly other people at risk.
I feel quite bored and restless, having had to stay at home for so long, however I think this is a small price to pay to help minimise the impact of the virus. I also feel a bit anxious about the whole situation, particularly as I live with my 2 parents, both of whom would be classified as more vulnerable to severe symptoms if infected with Coronavirus. They rely on me to do their food shopping etc., which is not a big problem, however I feel a strong responsibility to ensure I don't take any risks myself, due to the fear of infecting them.
Having been furloughed just 3 days ago, I'm also somewhat worried about the impact of the Coronavirus situation on my job as an offshore oil and gas worker, and I'm afraid of possibly not having a job to go back to once the situation does recede to a point where people can return to work etc.","About time people started to take Coronavirus seriously; it isn't just you at risk of infection and severe symptoms if you flout the lockdown rules!","7","6","7","4","2","3","Yes"

(It feels shared though, like everyone else is also feeling this.) I live with my partner and we get on very well so I have felt supported in that way, but feeling ever so slightly afraid every time we leave the house and not being able to see our friends is quite difficult. I think it feels almost like a grieving process. You can be distracted from thinking about it for a certain amount of time, and when you are reminded, all the fear and confusion and frustration comes back anew. I am worried for the economy and I'm saddened for people who will lose people or suffer, and for the NHS and its workers. I'm angry at the government for stripping back the resources needed to fight it, and for being lax at every opportunity. It feels very like we are helpless. There is next to nothing we can do, besides supporting our friends and family (remotely) and reaching out to neighbours. It's very hard to get my head around the entire situation as a whole, and as such, it feels very surreal.","It's all very surreal.

I also feel powerless to help, as I do not have any relevant skills & thus I'm not useful right now. This is a silly feeling, as it doesn't help anyone; at the same time it's not actually strong enough to prompt me to do more than just a few donations and gift vouchers. 
I also feel rather sad about my friends, who are in a worse position. I feel entirely blessed with my partner - but again, I'm lucky & not everyone is.

I'm also worried about the effect of all this on my son, who now cannot improve on his schoolwork in order to get the grades he needs (he was unwell eariler in the year). I'm also worried about income, as I'm self employed and quite affected by the crisis in that regard. On the plus side, it's like someone has pressed the 'pause' button on life, it's peaceful, we are lucky enough to be in a reasonable sized house with a garden, and when I'm not worrying, I'm actually very relaxed, with the lack of rushing here and there.","Life on pause.

On top of this, I still have the workload and responsibilities of a young student who recently got a car and flat, my MOT and tax (despite being new to me) is due during lockdown, which brings me to one of my final points and feelings, general confusion towards what the government is advising - there has been varying contradictions from the government on what we should and should not do.

However, I am feeling some positive emotions. I am a student who lives with 4 other people but they have all gone home and so I am able to relax in a house to myself. I also have more money saved as I am not able to go out and spend it. The thing I'm most happy about is that the levels of pollution in this and other countries has reduced dramatically and wildlife has started to reappear in places where it was scarce.

I feel that there's a desire to 'do the right thing', but that the consequences and impacts of the choices being made are not clearly understood. I feel like we're being held hostage by an 'enemy' that, while dangerous for a proportion of society, may prove to be significantly less formidable than thought with the benefit of hindsight. I feel like our personal and physical connections are a huge part of what defines our humanity, and that restricting them has hidden consequences, particularly for those who are vulnerable with mental health difficulties. I feel that - despite our being aware that pandemics are increasingly likely in our world, thanks to our global economy, the effectiveness of medicine in treating 'regular' diseases, etc. - we as a society were under-prepared, preferring to not spend the necessary money to protect us better. I feel like there's a lack of understanding of the difficulties inherent in preventing viral spread, but also an over-reaction in policing people's lives and the sacrifice of personal liberty. I feel depressed that this unprecedented situation will likely be used as an excuse/justification for issues in the future, and may hamper our ability to tackle other pressing problems in the world.

I am depressed that I'm not in a more significant role, able to better help people in need. I am bothered by the fact that the 'lockdown' has shown how barren my life is, but that I feel no ability to alter it, either now, or at the end of the current situation. I feel I'm struggling to properly engage with some of the more positive things that are happening - communities pulling together, activities online, reinforcements of ties between friends. I feel like social media, and the internet is proving both it's strengths and it's weaknesses at being a place to share both good and bad information, to make good and bad connections. I feel like the cost of this will be high, monetarily and otherwise, and that it may become a driver of division and conflict rather than a potential driver for change.

I am somewhat anxious about the longer-term outlook, for myself in terms of how long the lockdown situation might last and what effect it will have as time goes on. I am also worried (but in a more detached way, of course) about the wider situation in the country and the world overall - things will get drastically worse in some places before normality returns. And I am angry at many governments for mishandling the situation in various ways, for opportunistically using the crisis to implement authoritarian measures (e.g. Hungary), and for prioritising the 'need' to prop up the existing, already dysfunctional capitalist system rather than consider deeper long-term changes to economic and societal systems.","Well, on the upside, I now have an excuse for being an introverted shut-in, and I don't have to feel like a failure for not going out more.

I do believe once this is over the world may be a different place for years to come, one example being; more people will be working from home.

Working from home has also been a struggle as I do not have a quiet space where I can shut myself away from noise and distractions.

I feel extremely angry that the Government did not act sooner and that they continue not to be moving quickly enough on testing.

I feel desperate for those countries with inadequate healthcare systems.

I feel angry at the levels of inequality in this country, which continue to be felt through this crisis and have left our public healthcare system on its knees.

For myself though, having recovered from what I think was Covid-19 (a test would have been nice) and with (at the moment and hopefully continuing) well family/friends, I find myself able to make the most that this period of lockdown presents. I am eating better than ever, exercising daily and have time away from a job that I realise causes me stress. I live alone but am regularly in touch with family/friends by telephone and online. I am actually, in many ways, less lonely than normal. Plus, I am desperately pleased for the potential this period offers for the planet to heal itself a little. I love the city without cars: the air is clear and breathable, noise pollution from traffic outside my flat is down. And I like the simplicity and relaxed pace of this life: shopping infrequently and only for essentials; time to plan meals, time to exercise and time just to be.

I would not wish for this - the world should have been better prepared - but being better prepared means living more healthily, sustainably and fairly. I hope we are able to learn the lessons this tragic time has offered us.","Trying to make the most of #lockdownlife.

They are at high risk of contracting the virus. This makes me feel fearful half of the time. 

Personally, with the UK going in lockdown, it is the correct decision, but I do feel a little trapped and lonely right now. I feel that I can't escape my home and I hope this changes soon.

I do feel more relaxed than I did before this situation began, though, because I can rest in a way I couldn't then.

If it gets made compulsory, they'll only just be starting to be stuck indoors while I'll have been doing it for weeks already.

I am angry at Government for not heeding the 2019 Biosecurity advice from Scientists that another epidemic would happen at some point and that the UK should prepare and hold stocks.

I feel angry at the Government for not acting earlier on the clear WHO advice to do everything: test, test, test + contact tracing + social distancing.

I feel angry that elderly people are not being looked after properly. I saw an elderly man with a walking stick and a shopping bag join a queue outside Sainsburys the other day - the queue was 3 streets long and not moving.

I feel angry and disgusted that the Government didn't provide adequate PPE early enough for all of those that need it. Doctors and nurses have died because of exposure to corona virus, as have bus drivers and care workers. Care home workers still don't have protection, other than their usual apron and gloves.

I feel desire to help but I feel helpless.

I feel desire go out and live normally and to see my family and friends.

Feeling happy is the strongest way to face adversity, and not allow it to affect us in a negative way. I am worried about what happens next, but doing our best to live for today and enjoy today. What is happening to others is never far from our minds though, so we think of everyone each day.","Stay safe, be happy, be kind. Wash your hands, exercise from home, and follow the guidance.

I do feel a sense of anger and resentment at the irresponsibility of China, in so much as they create the perfect conditions for pathogens to transfer from animals to humans by eating bushmeat, and meat from unhygienic sources, and process and sell this meat in unsafe conditions such as wet markets.

I am not anxious about lockdown or staying at home - I am anxious about the number of people in the UK needing the ICU and our NHS’s ability to cope.

I am anxious that the curve is not flattening quickly. Will this end? How many people will be lost.

I am worried people out there working, such as my ICU nurse sister in law and feel guilty surrounding any deliveries we have.
I worry about my job and my own company and I wonder about the ethics of luxuries and I worry about people who may be suicidal. So many emotions.

Knowing that people are losing their lives to the extent we have to shut the entire planet down to prevent the apocalypse is absolutely terrifying. We could literally be on the brink of collapse, yet you have people going shopping 3-4 times a week as an excuse to carry on as normal.

The fact that so many people are so selfish - to the point of risking lives - is turning that fear and anxiety into a deeper sensation of anger. I wish I could pass a law censuring the people who keep talking about others going on picnics while they wander around shopping centres, as if there's a difference in risk nexus.","If we can't handle the responsibility of saving lives by doing literally nothing, maybe this virus is Mother Nature's way of evicting us for gross stupidity.","7","9","8","3","2","1","Yes"

However, my only family nearby is completely isolated due to being on the list for an organ transplant, and so obviously can't help out. I feel upset, as though I've slipped through the cracks in the system. I'm angry at the morons who keep going out and ignoring social distancing, and people who don't seem to understand basic hygiene.

The economy is going to tank again just as I was starting to gain my feet from the last financial crisis in 2008 which hit a few months after I finished high school. Stronger sanctions should have been in place weeks before the where to try and minimise the disruption to the world. All travel from hotspots banned, people quarantined for 14 days, large gatherings cancelled sooner. Hopefully lessons will be learnt for next time.

I am also bit disappointed about the fact that some people still do not listen the government instructions to stay home and only if necessary to go outside. I find it frustrated that to decrease spreading of virus people should try to stay at home. 
Also, the reason that I am personally scared and I think everyone else is because we do not have enough information about the virus, and how it is spreading or affecting different people. Some of the people get mild symptoms and others get severe symptoms that might cause death. Also, the fact that there is only limited resources at the hospital for the equipments (masks, gloves, protective gear, respiratory ventilators and etc.) which cause the ones working in the hospital more potential to get the virus. Included in the limited resources is also the fact that there is not enough space in the hospital for people, so if you have severe symptoms there might be not for chance to get in hospital. That is the another issue, that even if you get severe symptoms and you get to hospital, how long you can get support for your situation until your body is going to fail.

I also dislike the feeling of my world getting even smaller than it already was. I still go to work, which I am grateful about, and then I go home. My best friend does all my grocery shopping for me because I fear becoming ill (she does as well, but to a lesser extent). The high-light of my day is our daily 5km walk around the canal and fields on the outskirts of the little town we live in. I know it is contrary to the advice, but we both need to walk off our anxiety for our mental health. There are no people where we walk, just friendly sheep, two horses, two llamas (seriously), lots of swans and ducks and birdsong. It is the only time during the day when I feel somewhat relaxed, and it helps with my insomnia. I really hope this situation improves before more lives are lost and the economy deteriorates beyond repair. Many people around me are anxious and angry; a few are angry about being forced into non-essential work with social distancing that looks good in front of an inspection, but does nothing to actually protect people from contracting the virus.","To paraphrase a quote, when you're going through hard times, keep going.

Older people do need to take the whole situation more seriously as they're the ones not abiding by the distancing rules and that makes me more worried about them, and the possibility that they're spreading the virus. 

The financial situation is the biggest worry, with wage cut to 80% at the moment, assuming that comes through. Plus the concern that the business I work for may not survive this situation. Therefore it is important for to try not to spend money other than on essentials as I may need it to tide me over until I can find a new job after things reopen.

It kind of feels like an inevitability that we will contract it and feeling like someone (or possible multiple of people in my family) could die feels like a mind-numbing reality. I feel like I'm sitting around waiting to die all the time. 

In general the situation feels bleak. I feel like I have the most sympathy and concern for still-developing countries and refugees who are either displaced or people from war-torn countries.

I noticed one woman standing on the park path far away from her two children who were cycling in opposite directions to each other.

I worry about work because it is hard to do without being in an office with people and I miss the comaraderie but it has also made me realise that actually I don't really like my job and I would like to do something different now (career change?) which is a great realisation. ","Anxious about the future, but positive about being able to self care and concentrate on only the here and the now. ","5","6","8","2","1","1","Yes"

I feel like the Government are being evasive about the Prime Minister being in hospital which is making me worry that perhaps the situation is being worse than we are being led to believe. I am also very stressed at how NHS workers are unable to access equipment and tests when more well known people are able to access them with what appears to be very little effort.
I worry for self employed people at this time and the support they are getting and I am angry at big companies with rich owners who actually have the capacity to help but do not.","The PM will be receiving the very best health care there is whilst medical staff, the elderly, the infirm, the self employed, the poor and the vulnerable have to make do with whatever is offered to them (if anything)","5","4","7","8","5","3","Yes"

I'm surprised to feel supportive of the UK government's response to the epidemic and some admiration for the prime minister - to whose other policies I am strongly opposed. I am trying to use my time in lockdown to good effect but finding it harder than usual to concentrate. I have one daughter living in Madrid who is okay, but obviously I am worried about her. I have another daughter in the UK who is recovering from a mild case of Covid-19, so feel relieved about her recovery.","Wishing Boris Johnson a long life and a short premiership.","5","4","5","9","9","9","Yes"

The virus could mutate and come back even worse on a seasonal basis. Overall though I think it's likely there will be a vaccine within a year or so. It will be interesting to see how all of this social distancing influences behaviour once it is all over, and how easy it will be to return to normal. It might also be interesting to see how long this will take. I can't imagine a world where everything is back to normal any time soon. Some unsavoury characters might even tryo to take advantage of the situation.","Slightly worried but optimisitic.","6","5","8","1","1","1","Yes"

I have been very up and down during lockdown and can go from feeling OK in the morning to very worried, sad or anxious by the afternoon. I read about some nurses and a surgeon who died this morning and that made me feel really sad and worried for staff that are on the front line. I have periods of extreme worry about older relatives but don't worry so much about me or my husband getting it. I have been angry about people who are flouting the rules. I find the whole thing very surreal.","I heard about some nurses and a surgeon who have died from Corona in hospitals local to me.
