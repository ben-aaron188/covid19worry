Overall I do feel quite calm about the situation. Thankfully my family are safe and all self-isolating so I don't think there is any immediate danger of us getting the virus. However every time I watch the news and see on social media that there are still people not complying with the instructions from central government, I feel an overwhelming sense of anger towards this selfish behaviour. The longer people do not comply with the instructions, the longer this horrendous situation will continue. This behaviour not only indicates the level of ignorance, but also captures the sense of entitlement by these humans, to think their privileges override the basic health and safety of the general population.
