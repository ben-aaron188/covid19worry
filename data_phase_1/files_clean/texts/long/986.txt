It’s been three weeks since the lockdown now and my feelings were first despair and extreme anxiety about being in contact with an infected person with corona virus and also worrying about family members who don’t live with me but have significant health problems. This week I’m feeling very apprehensive about even going out to the shops so I’m staying in and haven’t left my flat in 14 days. I feel sad as I haven’t in that time seen anyone, I feel isolated but trying to keep myself busy in this current situation. I also feel bored and depressed at the prospect of not having a job when this is all over, not being able to currently pay my rent, council tax and electricity bills that are late already. I’m not so worried myself about catching this bug as I’m healthy,
