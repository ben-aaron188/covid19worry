I feel really sad about the Corona situation at the moment because my mother has a terminal illness and is alone and  is in hospital and i can not see her at all, if she passes away i feel sad that i could not see her and tell her that i will miss her.I understand the reasons for this to keep everyone safe but its a terrible situation to be in and there is no end in sight.I appreciate all the nurses care and the updates from them but seeing her myself is all i want at this moment in time, and i know my brothers feel the same, also grandchildren want to see her
