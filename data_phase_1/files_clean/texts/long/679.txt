I feel that the overwhelming majority of people are trying very hard to make this period of social distancing work but people need to try harder to protect our elderly and health workers. 
I wish that the government had taken the matter MUCH more seriously 2 months ago and then we might not be where we are now with the lack of resources for the NHS. Their lack of clarity in the last few weeks has also made a worse situation today.
I feel that if the government had introduced the lockdown two weeks before they did, as France and Spain did, our situation would not be what it is now and we would have less deaths from the covid 19 outbreak.
