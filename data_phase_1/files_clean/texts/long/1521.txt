It is a difficult situation where everyone needs to think of others. It angers me that people aren't following the rules as it will prolong the pandemic and potentially kill more people. I am missing my friends and boyfriend and feel frustrated that I can't leave the house but that other people are continuing to. I am not worried for myself getting the illness at all but am worried for others getting ill and dying. I hope that I have already had it so that I can continue living a normal life as soon as possible.
