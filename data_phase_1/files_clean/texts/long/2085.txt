I feel fairly motivated to pursue things I wouldn't normally have time to during quarantine such as running, learning some geography knowledge etc. I feel pretty bored as there is no televised sports at the moment which is a big part of my life. Also feeling sad for people currently losing loved ones to the virus. Have been feeling very grateful to the NHS and all its workers lately, putting themselves on the front line so we can all stay safe at home. I have been getting quite annoyed with people breaking the social distancing rules which I see when i go out running.
