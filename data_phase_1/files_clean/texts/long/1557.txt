I feel sad and worried because the future is uncertain. We live in the 21st century and yet we weren't prepared for something like this. We lived so carelessly and now we do ""trials and errors"" to find the right strategy to overcome this situation. It is indeed very sad because in the meantime people lose loved ones. Big corporations are so heartless and as business shrunk (due to the national lockdown) they start to fire employees. I am one of the many people who have lost their jobs during this crisis. The government's promises to support business obviously weren't enough to prevent employers from firing people. I am also angry because if the UK was put into a national lockdown earlier many lives could have been saved. Even now when we're under a lockdown, when I go grocery shopping I see many people don't follow the regulations the government issued. For example, yesterday the weather was warm and sunny and the park in my neighbourhood was full of people who certainly didn't stand 6 feet apart. Individuals should take responsibility!
