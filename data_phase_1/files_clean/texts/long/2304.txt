I'm very fearful for my family, I don't want anyone leaving the house but have to at points. It's very scary and I am desperate to do all I can to keep them safe. 

With a young family they are my main piority.
We are keeping up to date with the news, while trying to shield them at the same time.

The children are coping far better than us adults are doing currently.
It is a very unsettling time for everyone but know that being locked down is for the best for us all.
Hopefully this will come to an end soon but I can't see that being any time soon sadly
