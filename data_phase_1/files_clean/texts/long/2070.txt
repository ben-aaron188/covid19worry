I am feeling very anxious and concerned about the future. I feel sad about missing out on the end of my uni year, about not being able to see family and friends especially my boyfriend. Staying in lockdown is hard but is a good thing for us to do, it just is taking some getting used to. I am also stressed about my university work i have to complete. I have to do online exams but I am finding it extremely hard to concentrate. I am happy to be able to do my part for the NHS and all the essential workers in the country. That gives me some hope about how the country is sticking together and community is thriving.
