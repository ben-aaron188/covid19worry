I am feeling quite anxious about the corona virus due to being a key worker and so I am coming into contact with more people than I would like to and so I feel more at risk. Moreover, I have just had a notice from my work to say that we will be doubling the number of customers allowed in the shop at one time from 20 to 44. This has made me quite angry as I don't think this is the best action to take right now and I think it is very irresponsible. However we have been provided with face masks and gloves.
