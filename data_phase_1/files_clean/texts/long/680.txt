I feel scared because the magnitude of the infection is unknown and the amount of people it could effect has the potential to be huge. I feel empathy for the people who have lost a loved one and anger towards the population who are not taking this pandemic seriously and are carrying on having parties, sunbathing and are not social distancing. I feel grateful towards my family for supporting me as I continue working at my local pharmacy and lucky that we have not been affected by the virus yet. However I still feel hopeful that we as a country will get through this, although it will not be easy.
