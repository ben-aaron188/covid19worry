I am very anxious about the Corona situation and its many aspects . Firstly the people directly infected with the illness and those who have died and their family. I am deeply concerned for healthcare and care workers who are exposed to the virus and who do not have the proper equipment. I am concerned that the government don't seem to know what they are doing and I am concerned that the Health secretary and other ministers in the health section who have got ill themselves are a bad example to the general public - how can an effective government have let its own PM get infected? I am also concerned at the economic effect for those that have had their livelihoods taken away over night - those that are low paid any way (self employed, freelance/gig workers) and fall beneath the net while those employed with sick pay provision get a generous hand out from the government - it all seems grossly unfair. It will be impossible to abide by the stay at home restrictions for those in the gig economy who have no other income - UC is not enough to survive on.
