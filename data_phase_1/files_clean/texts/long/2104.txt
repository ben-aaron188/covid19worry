I feel worried for those at risk, particularly in my family, those who are older or have had health issues such as my grandparents. I am angry at those who are breaking the rules as if this continues we may not be able to go out at all, and my one walk a day keeps me sane . I am anxious about how long this will go on for and if I can go back to college, I am in my final year and want to be able to finish properly. It's a massive fear of the unknown as nothing has ever happened like this and the whole world is on lockdown. It's hard on many people's mental health, having to stay at home and not being able to go out and socialise and be with family members.
