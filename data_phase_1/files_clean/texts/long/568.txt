Very anxious and fearful as I would love to have a good summer yet people are still meeting up with other households which are then infecting people. People aren't taking this seriously and so it is making me annoyed.  When people start to listen then I would be more happier because then it's less people getting infected. I hate being in the house and would love to see my family but unfortunately I can't as people are being silly about it all. My anxiety is very high and my depression is getting worse as I can't get out and going out was my safe place but now I can't as I might get infected.
