Covid-19 has completely taken over my life, in that it has changed the way I work and it has made my flatmate's economic situation a lot more anxious, which obviously has a knockon effect on me.  I am anxious about my health, as I am asthmatic and have had a cough (but no other symptoms) for 3 weeks now - I worry that, although I think it is probably just a cough, there is no way of knowing for sure as I wouldn't be able to get tested for Coronavirus.   I spend a lot of spare time taking online science courses about Covid-19, which is very interesting.  I read recently that this situation could go on for another year and a half, which means that our lives are going to be so changed and uncertain for ages.   And does that mean I won't get to see my parents again for all that time?  That makes me a bit sad.  At the same time as feeling worried about these things, I feel that this is something that is totally out of my control beyond the sensible precautions that I can take, and it is something that is no-one's fault.  Whether I survive it or not seems largely down to luck!  There is something quite liberating in that.  This is also an exciting time to be alive - this situation is completely novel to me.
