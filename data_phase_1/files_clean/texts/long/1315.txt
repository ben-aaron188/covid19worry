I’m very worried about my household catching corona virus I have small children. I’m also really worried about my parents and grandparents catching it they are elderly and not in great health. My husband works for the nhs so is still out at work everyday so even though I’m social distancing with the children it feels pointless as he’s going out picking up germs. I’m trying to homeschool my children one who has dyspraxia and needs to run off a lot of energy not great with a small garden. I’m also sick of seeing people out and about in groups
