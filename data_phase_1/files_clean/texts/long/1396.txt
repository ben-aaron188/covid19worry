As much as I appreciate and understand the action taken by the government, i find it very inconvenient at the minute as I miss my outdoor hobbies and struggle to work from home. What’s more, the fact that some people, though the minority, are deciding to act selfishly and defy the intrusion given is very frustrating. I feel let down my some people in my country as we must come together in order to tackle the virus as efficient as possible. I try my best to do my part and ensure my family and friends do as well which is why I can’t understand some people’s behaviour.
