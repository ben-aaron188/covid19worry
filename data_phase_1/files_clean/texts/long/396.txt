personally not too worried about catching it myself since im staying at home all the time, although i am appauled as to how the goverment responded to it, especially the UK goverment, they didnt start doing anything about it until way too late, and even then they didnt make it mandatory, just a suggestion, and they wouldnt follow their own suggestions

also I feel terrible for all the older people who are in the at risk category because I bet most of living in fear and are probably going crazy being stuck at home for weeks at a time
