As a student, I am very concerned about the future of my education due to the recent uncertainty over exams and university. I am also concerned about family members and making sure they are kept as safe as possible. It is unnerving to me that people are ignoring government guidelines and continuing to go out in large groups and attend gatherings in public places. I am reassured to a certain extent as the death toll is very low in comparison with the entire population of the United Kingdom, however it is concerning that so many people are falling ill with this disease.
