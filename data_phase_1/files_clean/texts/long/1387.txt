I feel stressed that the Corona situation is affecting my daily life. I am worried that soon I may not be able to leave the house to exercise. I don't know what I would do if I weren't allowed to go to my allotment... this worries me more than anything other than actually getting the virus. I am concerned that my husband may contract the virus during his work at affected hospitals, and that there is a possibility that he could die from it. I am concerned for my father-in-law who is in his 80s, that he may contract it.  I have a constant level of anxiety over the situation.
