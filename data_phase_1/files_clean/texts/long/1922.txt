I feel annoyed that so many people are out on the streets but other than that I'm fine. I am a key worker so I must still go to work and I am an introvert so I prefer staying in any way. Before lockdown was not dissimilar to the situation I am in now. I am anxious only because so many people are out all the time and not about getting the virus myself. That doesnt concern me only I worry somebody else would get it thats why I stay in. It also annoys me that the shops are low on stock because of some selfish people.
