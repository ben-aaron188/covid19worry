I am anxious about the potential that myself and family will contract COVID.  Generally I am more anxious about my familyâ€™s health than my own. It makes me nervous when leaving the house for food etc. I am saddened by the news of deaths that I am constantly hearing. I feel angry at those who still go out and do not practice the distance rules.  However I am hopeful that my family and I will all get through this healthy. Coronavirus keeps me motivated to eat healthier and stay fitter through daily exercise, however this is driven by anxiety of contracting the disease. Overall coronavirus makes me feel anxious and on edge.
