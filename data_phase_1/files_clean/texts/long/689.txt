I wish I knew how long this would last for and that everyone I care about will survive it, not just physically but I am concerned for their mental well being too and my own mentalhealth. I am not going to see a soul for many many days and already haven't for about 17 days. I am sad for all the suffering that is happening and the injustice of the nhs workers and the carers dying for lack of safety equipment. I am sad for those experiencing grief in the worse way possible as they can't be with their loved ones or have funerals attended in the normal ways. I am curious about what life will be like for us all when all this is over. I tend to think of it as this year is a right off and I hope next year the coronavirus will have passed as I can't cope with the uncertainity of not knowing how long this is for. But I am afraid that I might be wrong and that it may last for longer than a year. I wish I could just go to sleep until it is all over and the pandemic is over.
