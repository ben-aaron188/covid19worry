Not been too worried about it to be honest. I’ve been 80% since I’ve been off from about the 20th March I believe. Partner still in work due to key worker, she works in a nursery linked with NHS, so will be working right through I could imagine. Happiness because I’ve been home looking after my 2 year old daughter. Never have I had the chance to spend this much time with her. It’s been great. Sometimes annoyed with how government have dealt with some issues. Not quick enough etc to make big decisions. Not clear enough regarding who should/shouldn’t work, I’m a carpenter. My company were in limbo and pretty much left to my boss to decide if we should stay open or not. He decided to close. But we do insurance works. So could potentially delay people getting back home etc.
