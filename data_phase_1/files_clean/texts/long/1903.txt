It is a strange feeling to be a part of something effecting the global community. I feel safe at home but only wish that others would take it more seriously and follow social distancing rules.
The government has tried its hardest to ensure that families and communities are as well taken care of as can be and I see so much community spirit and care amongst the population.
I only hope that globally the death rate slows and we are able to move on and evolve for the better of everyone.
We have a chance to evolve not only the healthcare system but also education, environmental action and other very pressing issues
