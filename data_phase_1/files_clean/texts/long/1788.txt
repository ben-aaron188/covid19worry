I feel it is a great concern to 'everyone', this includes infants and babies. As they also can find it hard to breathe and have symptoms that can relate to it, even if it isn't. It is still a worry, as 'everything' evolves around it. Not just for adults or the elderly.

Also, there are many other key workers/sectors who are not NHS. Who are also doing a tremendous job to keep humanity safe, hygienic, streets clean, vulnerable people of young and old on drugs and alcohol, ill mental capacity safe as possible with a sound mind with their health precautions in place, government legislation in check the list goes on. 'They' too should be included in the media/adverts and be able to attend supermarkets at set times for them as well, not just the NHS. Those additional key workers/key sectors DESERVE RECOGNITION 100% TOO.
