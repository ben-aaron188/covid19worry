I feel anxious for my family. I feel anxious for the country, and the world as a whole. I feel angry with the current political state of the country, and angry with the treatment and neglect of important services and workers, such as the NHS. I feel angry with people's selfish responses to the situation, for example extreme panic buying, or continuing mass gatherings/ not following guidelines and rules. I feel sad and angry that some people, and some governments, only really care about this situation because it affects everyone, including themselves, but they overlook many other serious problems that might only affect marginalised people. I feel sad that I cannot be with all of my friends and family now, and that I'm missing out on many opportunities. I feel guilty when I feel bad because other people have a lot less privilege than me. I feel grateful that I'm with friends at the moment. I feel thankful for everyone doing what they can to help.
