I am feeling very concerned for the direct impact this will have on my family if they were to contract this virus. I am also anxious for the future of society and the financial implication this will have. Although I do feel that as a society there is a possible potential for us to change positively, to become kinder, more compassionate and more considerate. Further this could give us all a thrive for life and to enjoy it more when we come out of this. I feel anger towards the government for not taking action sooner.
