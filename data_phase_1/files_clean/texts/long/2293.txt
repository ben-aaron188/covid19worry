I am very worried about the Prime Minister. I think it is awful that so many people are dying and there doesn't seem to be much anyone can do to help it - there is no effective cure. I am sad for not being able to travel to see my family. Right now, I'm just anxious about getting the virus, the virus affecting my family, but also I worry about the Prime Minister. He's not just the leader of Britain, but also a man with a baby on the way. I feel anxious and think about the one or two bouts of coughing I had today and wonder if they are symptoms of the virus.
