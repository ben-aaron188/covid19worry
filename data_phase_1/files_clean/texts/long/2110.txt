I am not worried that I will get Coronavirus. This is because I am adhering to the government advice and staying in my home and having minimal exposure to the outside world. When I do go out I am on my own and make sure I stay at least 5 metres away from people where possible. I also feel that my health is strong enough that if I did get the virus I would survive it so I don’t feel worried. I am, however, angry about the people who are not paying attention to the guidelines surrounding social distancing and being in a state of lockdown. They should be made to feel guilty and embarrassed for putting other people’s lives at risk.
