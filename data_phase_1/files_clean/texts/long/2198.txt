Global disaster that doesn’t affect you until it does. I don’t know anyone who has had or has it, yet it clearly affects a lot of people. I’m looking forward to life getting back to normal as it’s difficult juggling working from home and raising my child. I mostly just feel tired and lethargic, staying indoors is energy sapping. I worry about myself getting it, mainly because I don’t want to be fully quarantined for two weeks. Throughout it all I have to wonder how this thing really started, and how long it’s really been around for.
