I'm afraid for what this means for the people I know, but I trust that with all the changes that are being made in the UK will help keep me, and those I hold dear, safe.

I am so grateful to live in the UK instead of the USA. I feel safer and more secure living here and under this government.

Though there is so much upheaval, I am still positive that not all is lost, that there's still hope for all of us around the globe. 

The main worry is that other people will not be so caring of others and spread the virus by ignoring basic instructions like 'stay at home' and 'wash your hands'. There is no need for the virus to get a hold on us via such simple things - if all of us band together, I feel as though we would be better off.
