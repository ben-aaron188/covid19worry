I am scared and worried. I am a key worker in retail and in the front line serving and touching people all day. I am scared of getting covid 19 from someone and as I’m 51 and my partner 56 it could be risky. 
I’m scared of customers getting abusive if they can’t get the goods they need or they have to queue. 
I’m scared of having to go off sick and not being able to afford my bills. 
I miss my mum and siblings and niece and nephews as I can’t see them. 
I miss being able to go out for a meal or drinks when I want. 
I’m scared of anything happening to my loved ones. 
I just want life to go back to normal.
