i think the whole country should be on full lockdown as to many people are not following the rules
to many people are dying if they stayed at home then they wouldnt pass the virus on to others and make more people ill
the quicker people listen to the rules the quicker the virus will go and more people will be saved then we can all get on with our lives and spend time with all our familys but until they do as they are told the longer my kids wont see their family grand parents aunties and uncles
corona virus is deadly and not something to be ignored and joked about but needs to be taken seriously
