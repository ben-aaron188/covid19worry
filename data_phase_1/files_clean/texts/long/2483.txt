I feel frustrated and tired from being stuck inside. I miss seeing my friends and socialising. Prior to COVID-19, I was in a difficult situation in my life and my few releases were social events and sports. Now, this has been taken away, I have had to adjust, which has been a very difficult task. I keep up to date with my friends via social media and we try to entertain ourselves with online quizzes and films. I usually watch a tv series and film a day to pass the time. This can be very tedious and rather boring.
