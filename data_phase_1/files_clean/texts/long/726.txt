I think its very saddening. I feel for all the families who have lost someone close to them. I think people should take this situation more seriously and start actually following the rules by not going out, unless essential like buying groceries or going to work. I'm very thankful to the  nhs and everyone is helping with this crisis. Hoerver, I understand there has been a lot of pressure on the nhs but I think there should be more testing in the uk. Because there are many many people out there who possible have the corona virus but are still waiting to be tested. I think this is worsening the covid crisis as its a lot more likely that the disease can spread to others. And since self isolation is advised its also likely that people will spread the virus to other people within their household. I am really hoping this will come to an end  soon.
