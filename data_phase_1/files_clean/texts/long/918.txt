Iâ€™m anxious about the future for my grown up kid (in their 20s) and the health of my mother and her partner. I fear that my responses as a key worker will further affect my daughter who has a diagnosed mental health condition.  I am also anxious for friends and relatives who work in the NHS. I am not particularly concerned for myself but for the world in which my children will have to navigate as they look to establish themselves in the workplace. I feel my privilege more than ever being able to continue to work and feed and house my family
