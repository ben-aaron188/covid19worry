I feel very concerned regarding the situation and I am very scared for the safety of my friends and family. I was shocked to learn that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been taken into intensive care- his strong leadership has been a reassurance throughout this time and his incapacitation is severely detrimental to our situation and makes me feel anxious for his health and safety.
 I do not feel that the Chinese Government have taken enough responsibility in this situation and their practices now endanger us all.
