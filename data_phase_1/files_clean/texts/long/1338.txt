Incredibly stressed and worried for the future, politically, financially and educationally.  Upset about potential consequences for family and whether we’ll all see each other again. Stressed about finances as 80% wages only just covers costs, nothing to fix the car if it breaks or to visit the vets if there’s a problem with the cats.
I keep imagining 4-500 years into the future where aliens send away teams to explore Earth which has no sign of human life and discover our current situation. I watch far too much sci-fi!
