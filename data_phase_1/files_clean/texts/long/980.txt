Anxious about when this is going to end, and how, anxious about friends and family and other people since my family is mostly from the north of Italy where the contagion is particularly acute, as well as anxious about my future career in academia connected with the fact that universities are shrinking their teaching and research staff because next year there will be most likely much fewer students and, hence, they will receive much less money in tuition fees. I am also happy that the numbers of deaths and new cases are dropping across the board, especially in Europe. I hope that Global South countries won't experience dramatic outbreaks.
