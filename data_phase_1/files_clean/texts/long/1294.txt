I am mostly bored being stuck at home with limited things to do. I find working from home difficult and I get distracted, but now I have two weeks off work. I am a little apprehensive about the situation, especially for my older relatives. However, I would mostly just like to know what the future holds and how long we will be in lock down etc and when things will go back to normal. Not knowing when we will be able to go back to work/normal life is difficult to live with so it raises my anxiety level a little bit.
