Right now I’m apprehensive. I face redeployment to the frontline in the next few days. I feel anxious about impact of that on me and my health, I fear the impact on my children. I’m angry that there is an unfair division of labour and some are expected more than others. I’m also relaxed in some ways as My husband has been furloughed and can look after the children. It’s a complex ever changing mix of emotions that is continually evolving as the situation around me changes quickly. I’m acutely aware of my feelings and my response and am tracking my emotions closely and implementing coping strategies to keep me calm despite my concerns.
