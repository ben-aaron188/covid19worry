For all the technological and scientific advances that the human race has made, most societies still function through exploitation of people for the main purpose of personal wealth. Its about time we focused more about looking after all aspects of life on our planet and less time and resources on disposable consumer goods. Viruses will devastate the human race during a time in which the world is driven by consumerism and globalisation. We care less about the preservation of the only known planet in the universe to contain life and more about exploiting its limited resources for profit. Unfortunately, I am a firm believer that we will lack the knowledge and resources to combat a more serious virus in the future if the global community doesn't shift its focus away from capitilism in its present form.
