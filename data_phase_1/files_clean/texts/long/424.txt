At this moment in time I feel annoyed because many people are ignoring the Quarantine rules despite knowing the consequences. They are going to their friend's houses, going to public parks and socialising and not taking anybody else into consideration. By doing this they are putting the rest of us at risk. I feel like the current lock down will be extended because of people's inability to follow simple rules.
I also feel worried because many people are dying from the disease. Quite a few people's parents are dying and I find this worrying and upsetting. The fact that people have to dies a lonely death is quite disturbing.

Lastly, I feel rather isolated. I am staying with people, but it would be nice to see my friends. Facetime and Houseparty will have to do for the mean time.
