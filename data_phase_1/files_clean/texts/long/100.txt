I'm concerned about the health and wellbeing of the people I love most. My immediate and extended family along with my close friends. This virus doesn't seem to be discriminating right now and I'm worried someone I love will catch it. I'm also concerned about finances. We're already £500 down in 2 weeks, so I'm worried about how I will pay my rent. I wish the government would announce some kind of emergency funding for those of us who do privately rent and have seen our incomes fall. A grant of £500 a month to help would be really beneficial right now. It wouldn't cover all of our losses but it would allow me to pay my rent! And it would be good if other essential services such as energy suppliers and TV/phone/broadband providers helped with waiving costs for a while given that people are relying so heavily on this service right now.
