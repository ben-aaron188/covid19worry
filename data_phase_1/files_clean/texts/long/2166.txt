I live in an area that has some issues with groups gathering and it worries me greatly. I have reported it to the police, the council and the press but I haven't received a response as yet. The news about Boris Johnson also concerns me greatly. I can't help myself the whole situation is worse than we have been told. I don't know how we will ever get back to normal and I worry hugely about the future of my job. We need an economy to go back to. The longer this goes on the more insecure the future. I am working from home at the moment and I don't know how much longer I will be able to do that. I think my business will close for a while and I'm dreading it.
