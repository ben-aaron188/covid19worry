The corona virus is making me feel scared, worried and sad. This is a horrible time for everyone in the world. I’m worried as we don’t know when this will end when it will go back to normal. I’m sad that so many people are getting ill and dying   from this. I’m scared someone I love is going to die, I don’t know what I’ll do. The NHS are doing amazing everyone is coming together. However the selfish people that are still going out meeting with mates, still doing parties, I’m disappointment with them why would they do this when there are so many people dying. I want it to end.9
