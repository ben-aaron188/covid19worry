Right now i feel anxious about COVID-19 as i don't want any of my family or friends to get the virus. I have a few family members in the vulnerable category so praying they don't get it. I am also concerned about my university degree which is up in the air at the moment as in am in final year and don't have much support from the university. We have exams and presentations coming up and have not been given any guidance on whether they will go ahead or be cancelled. I am also concerned about my future job prospects as graduates and placement jobs are unrealistic at this moment in time.
