i am worried how long this is going to go on, i am shielding as i have stage 4 cancer, how much longer can i live like this. The NHS can only do so much, this problem is going to get so much worse. My anxiety levels has risen extremley my depression is worse. How are people who have no one to ask for help going to manage? The poor have no chance of surviving this, the rich are going to get poor, the country is going to pot. I have cancer my treatment has stopped, what if i get more ill will i get treatment then? I have no one to help me, i am stressed, anxioux, depressed and my mental health is getting worse
