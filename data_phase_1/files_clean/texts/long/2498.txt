I'm satisfied that I'm doing all I can to avoid contracting or spreading the disease, so I try not to scare myself with worst-case scenarios. I'm surprised to feel supportive of the UK government's response to the epidemic and some admiration for the prime minister - to whose other policies I am strongly opposed. I am trying to use my time in lockdown to good effect but finding it harder than usual to concentrate. I have one daughter living in Madrid who is okay, but obviously I am worried about her. I have another daughter in the UK who is recovering from a mild case of Covid-19, so feel relieved about her recovery.
