I feel anxious for what the government chooses to do next and I anticipate their next move.

I’m nervous for the safety of my family but not so much for myself as I’m not at a great risk for coronavirus or to die from it.

Time off work, working from home and having a more relaxed day is easier when it comes to stress and time management. It has been relaxing overall to do a lot less work and I have been exercising often and taking some walks.  

Also, coronavirus has made some frustrations such as stocks for products in stores and online products being extreme low which is very annoying. As we have been shopping a lot less there are times where we often run out of supplies and have to make do for days at a time. Services I would have used a lot before I now use a lot less which is slightly annoying.
