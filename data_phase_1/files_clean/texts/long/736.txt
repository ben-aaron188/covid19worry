I am very sad that the government have let us get in this situation by taking so long to act. The figures rising every day is particularly scary that the scale of this virus is constantly spreading and hurting more people. The stupidity of some members of the public still going out and about makes me angry and frustrated that they have so little consideration for those most at risk. I worry that this will continue for a long time and really affect peoples finances and living situations. The uncertainty of when we can go back to our normal lives makes me anxious.
