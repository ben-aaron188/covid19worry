I feel extremely paranoid that I will get corona.
I'm doing everything in my power to stay indoors.
I wipe every item that comes into my house.
I want it to be over I fear for my life an my family n friends
My anxiety levels are high, an I cant sleep at night, I also have no desire to do anything at all around the house.
I watch an read social media, and that doesnt help at all.
I also worry alot about my financial situation.
I have plans that have been ruined now, an I solely blame Asia for eating anything that moves and those markets are horrendous an need  losing immediately
