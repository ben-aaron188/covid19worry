I'm fearful for my younger brother who works in a supermarket then goes home to our elderly mum who has underlying health conditions. I'm scared for my two young children and what life will be like after this is over. Or will it ever be truly over? Will our lives go back to what they were before? I'm frightened to go out outside for fearing what I could bring back inside the home to my children. It's exhausting being at home with two young children all day long while trying to work from home. I feel so sad to hear about what's going on in the rest of the world, especially New York.
