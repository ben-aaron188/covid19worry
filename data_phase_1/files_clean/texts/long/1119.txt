I feel a bit conflicted. I am staying inside, but then I have to work in the co-op (2 times a week). But then having to work my normal job. (being deployed to the co-op). So, I take it seriously but then in the co-op I have soo many walking around me not respecting the 2 m distance and it stresses me out. 
but then I think, if they don't take it seriously, maybe i am over worrying? (i know this is not true)
It is also hard, because both my housemates have been furlowed, and I have not and will not will. So it is stressful trying to keep a routine, and my health is deteriating.
