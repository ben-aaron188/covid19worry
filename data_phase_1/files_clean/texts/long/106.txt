I am surprisingly calm. I try to stay in the moment and force myself to accept that I personally cannot improve the situation more than adhere to the advice and rules put in place. I thought I would be more anxious but I seem to have settled in a ""I'm doing what I can"" and ""I cannot change or prevent any possible outcomes by worrying about it"" This is not typical for me as I am a very anxious person normally, which makes me suspicious that there will be reprecussions later. I still ""go"" to therapy once a week over video call which keeps me sane.
