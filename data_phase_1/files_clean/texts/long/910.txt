A little bummed out about the whole thing. Being stuck inside is boring, especially when the weather is nice. Hopefully it won't be like this for too much longer. On the whole though, i am not so worried about the disease itself, more so all of the precautions that come with it. I can see why it would be very worrying for those people who have family members or others in their household who are thought to be at risk. The Government's response, if a little slow, has been surprisingly good so far so i hope that continues.
