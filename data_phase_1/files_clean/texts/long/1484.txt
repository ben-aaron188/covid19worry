I have a feeling that the end of the world will soon come. Our life has turned into a monotonous sitting at home. My health has already deteriorated. I feel it. I often look after watching the news on television.
I constantly worry about my parents. I am afraid our medical system may not cope with many patients. I'm shocked! How it is possible to live. I'm tired of the bad news. My family is suffering. We can't walk down the street normally. We are afraid to get infected. Horror and anxiety! I very worry about my work. I may lose my job because of this epidemic.
