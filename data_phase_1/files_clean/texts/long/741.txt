As someone who works for the NHS and lives alone in a town where I know very few people I'm scared. My Mother lives 80 miles away and at the age of 87 could be terribly affected by this disease should she catch it. I worry her social situation, she also lives alone, will contribute to a decline in cognitive function. although living in an urban environment outside of Birmingham she has few people who can shop for her and she has no method of communication where she can in interact with anyone visually eg facetime.
