I am scared that the world will change too much after all of this is over. I normally love a good life, my wife and I both work, and we manage to get by comfortably and keep our kids. Now we are both at home, not getting money in as usual. But we still have our health for now. 

I just hope that the world can go back to how it was when all of this is over. I think we will be back to normal in winter then it could be the same again, only we will hopefully be better prepared. There will be mega inquests into how governments around the world handled this.
