It's very sad not being able to see your friends due to the lockdown. Also, a massive concern to me and probably a lot of other people is their tenancies which might end before the end of this coronavirus situation. Personally, this stresses me about the future. It also brings great concern that both my grandmothers are in their 80s, meaning that if they catch COVID they'll likely die, while I won't be able to go see them. Finally, another source of anxiety is the looming economic crisis. People who didn't have the best financials before COVID -like me- will probably have a hard one to two years ahead of them.
