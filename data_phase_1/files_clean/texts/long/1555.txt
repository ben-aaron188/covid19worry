I feel happy and fortunate to be with a supportive family, and lucky to be at home, with a garden and fresh air. I feel sad not to be with my partner, and to be isolated from my friends and wider family, as I get a lot of joy and happiness from socialising with them. I feel anxious about going out and leaving the house to go grocery shopping, so usually let my parents do this. I feel anxious in general about the uncertain nature of how long lock down will be lasting, and how I will cope once this is over. I am also aware of how different the world will be following the end of the pandemic, and am anxious to have some sort of timescale announced as to when it will end.
