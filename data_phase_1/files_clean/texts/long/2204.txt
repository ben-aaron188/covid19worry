I feel very anxious about the current Coronavirus situation. I feel worried that my family will become. I am worried that I won’t be able to get food for my family and provide for them. Homeschooling my children is very stressful while trying to work from home. I am worried about the affect schools being closed will have on my children’s education in the long term. I am worried about my mother who had a heart condition and lives in her own as I am her only family and if I became ill there would be no one to look after he.
