I am concerned for my family's safety and I'm worried about  the impact isolation will have on the mental health of my loved ones. I feel worried about the process of coming out of isolation and how safe this will be. I work in a large secondary school and I worry immensely about the students I teach and how they are managing isolation for this period of time. I worry about the larger impact of covid-19 on our community and the financial health of those around me for the future. Although financially I am safe at the moment I worry about what this will look like the longer time goes on. My toddler is missing his peers at nursery and establishing a new normal for him at home has been challenging as he misses the routines he has thrived on for the last three years.
