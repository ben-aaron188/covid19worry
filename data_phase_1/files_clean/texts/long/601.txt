My husband has been ill with it for 18 days and now how pneumonia. He has been self isolating in another part of the house. His symptoms have been very varied up and down throughout the whole time he has been ill, thinking he's been improving then getting worse. I have an elderly disabled mother who I look after who I am very concerned about as well as my two children. My husband is very fit and strong and eats well etc. and this has completely wiped him out.  The worry of catching this and passing it on is very much on my mind. I haven't slept properly for the last 2 and a half weeks. It is making me feel awful and I am on high alert that I don't catch it to and become unable to care for him. So all in all a very scary, difficult time.
