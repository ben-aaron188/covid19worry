I'm extremely worried at this moment in time about the extent in which this will have on people's health and lively hoods. I fear for the health of my friends and family, and their well being. Im also worried about the financial affects this is going to cause to me and my family and the economy in a whole and how it will effect our jobs and if we were to lose our jobs what will we do next because there will be a lot of jobs being lost to this and it will not be easy to find another job due the affects this will have on the whole world's economy not just ours.
