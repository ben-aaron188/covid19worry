Worried, stressed, scared and what will happen after awhile . Is everything going to go to normal again so we can see our family’s and friends . I’m a key worker and I’m so scared to go in to work at the moment with what’s going on. My sons school is closed and his going from home and it’s so hard to support him as I’m not a teacher and I have a one year old and I have to think about my kids and family because they come first in life . But worried about all the nhs staff and everyone . I lost a family member about a week ago and I couldn’t even go and see my friend because of what is going on. These are sad times because u hear people dieing because of this virus and I just want it to stop .
