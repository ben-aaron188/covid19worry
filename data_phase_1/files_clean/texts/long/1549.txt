I am stuck in a different house to my partner due to her being a frontline worker and I am in the health vulnerable group  at risk. 
It making my anxiety levels high and I feel very worried. 
Work are not really being supportive and feel I should be at work when my health professionals are are saying I must stay at home. 
I do feel we are being well informed by the government in the best way they can but it is all a learning curve for everyone. 
At times there is only so much media you can take in otherwise it make me more stressed and sends my pulse levels very high.
