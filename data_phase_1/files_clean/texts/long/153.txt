My emotions have been quite up and down over the last few weeks as a result of being in lockdown. Sometimes I feel quite content. I know I am very lucky due to my situation at home. But there have been times where I feel lonely and miss having the opportunity to see important people in my life, such as my boyfriend.

I also feel for all the people whose families are being so badly effected and for those who have lost and are losing loved ones. Two of my friends lost their grandads within a couple of days each other and I think that is when the situation really hit home for me.
