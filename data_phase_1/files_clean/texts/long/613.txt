I don't like being in lockdown, I feel quite trapped and it is causing my anxiety and depression to flare up. I also don't like that I can't always buy the food I need, being on a budget I have to stick to the cheaper options and am unable to buy the alternatives. I find people have been very selfish in panic buying when there really was no need for it as we can all still go to the shops. 

Being in a small flat isn't helping how I feel either and I miss my family, especially as my nan is getting very depressed and has all but given up and needs to see me.
