I have been worried but at this moment I am feeling more positive. I feel healthy as do my family and because of that I feel more relaxed about the situation. I feel relaxed as it is the end of the day and I have had fresh air, I am grateful to be able to do this and be able to maintain social distancing rules. I feel somewhat frustrated that I am not being productive enough in quarantine. I heard on the news the death rate may be starting to plateau better which made me feel happy. I always feel a little anxious in the back of my mind not knowing when quarantine will end.
