I am stressed as i do not know what is in store for the rest of my degree. I have no motivation to complete my assignments. I don't think its fair for universities to expect us to produce the same quality of work.  I am also worried for my grandparents, who are high risk. But in general I am hopeful that it will be over soon. I am avoiding excessive exposure to news outlets, as i do not want to increase my anxiety surrounding the situation. I am aware of the seriousness of the pandemic, but i feel others are not taking it seriously. Therefore, it is quite stressful, as the minority are really letting us down.
