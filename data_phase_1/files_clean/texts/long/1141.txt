The unknown is what makes me anxious,  I’m healthy so am not to worried if I catch it,  as I think I would recover.  The feeling of not knowing when we will come out of lockdown is daunting and the bad behaviour of the few not social distancing makes me feel that the lockdown will become stricter and longer. I started a new job and was made redundant within 3 weeks so have the worry of my future,  I worry how quickly the economy will recover.  The fear of being out of work is very concerning as I’ve never not worked and this more than anything causes me the most anxiety.
