I am feeling quite anxious about the whole situation. Fortunately I am in a good position, but I know there are a lot of people out there who are struggling either with the virus or knock on effects of it. I feel anxious as I don’t know when it is going to end, and helpless as I feel I can’t help much in these uncertain times. They are unprecedented times, and no one really 100% know what’s going to happen in the long run. I hate that there is so much unnecessary death going on right now.. but I also feel very grateful we have the wonderful NHS and all key workers onboard to battle this virus as best we can do as a nation.
