I am concerned by how unequipped the governments have been in their response (Particularly in the early days of March, when they made many very poor choices and decisions. All of which is likely to jeopardise the well being of the UK as a whole) and disappointed in the public who are being inconsiderate in these times. I am also concerned for the small businesses, especially since both my parents own small businesses

However, I am confident that the economy and well being worldwide will bounceback after COVID-19 dies down. Additionally, I believe that we will be better for it, learning from mistakes made and being prepared for the future
