At the moment I feel very sad about the Pandemic. I am sad that I can't see my friends and my family and I can't embark on new adventures. I am anxious about my future and what lies ahead. I am concerned with the welfare of friends and family.

I feel anxious with my work situation because I was working abroad and now I am back in the UK living with my mother which I haven't done for 12 years since I was a teenager! 

I also feel trapped because we are unable to travel, go out and enjoy life, however I feel a little peace as I am able to enjoy doing things for myself such as read and fitness and get in to a good routine. 

I worry about work because it is hard to do without being in an office with people and I miss the comaraderie but it has also made me realise that actually I don't really like my job and I would like to do something different now (career change?) which is a great realisation.
