It's very stressful but right now I am talking the time to focus on what needs to be done in my life, for example my studies in order to come out the other side having coped well. It's definitely putting a strain on me and testing how I navigate my relationships. I feel a little lost and it's hard to maintain to a good structure when your days don't appear to have real meaning. I try to stay out of the news but it is unavoidable. I feel a slight anger towards those who fail to comply with social distancing but I also have hope that we can all band together to see this through.
