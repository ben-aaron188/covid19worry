Uncertain about when things will seem to go back to 'normal' and when we will be able to begin things that we enjoy doing again. When will cultural events re-open and when can we visit our families again?

Unsure about how this will come to an end and what will happen in terms of politics after. 

Happy that all of my family and friends are safe and staying inside. Happy that supermarket stock has now stabilised so we can buy essentials after stock piling. 

Happy that I have time to do things I wouldn't usually like baking and crafts
