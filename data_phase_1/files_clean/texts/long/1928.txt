I feel this is an abomination, and i am very displeased i cannot see my friends and family. I feel very saddened by the world falling apart. I feel very lonely and anxious about the whole situation and wish we knew what was happening next as it is unknown. I am back on my medication due to the anxiety it has caused me and fear for my family and loved ones. I really hope for a resolution to happen as i miss the humanity and way everyone was together, i miss human contact and second guessing what we all will be doing in months to come
