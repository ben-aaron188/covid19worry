I find it hard adjusting to the whole lockdown situation and within a week anxiety hit me due to how overwhelming the situation is but I am slowly getting better but my work is pretty poor due to the very many distractions that are happening right now. I am currently trying to get my mind straight so I can focus more on the work I have to do as I have my dissertation due as well as summer exams where even though they won't effect my grade if I do bad, I still want to do well in these. Hopefully this will only last a few weeks this lockdown as I miss spending time with my friends as I am a very social  person
