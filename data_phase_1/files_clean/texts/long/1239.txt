Definitely feeling very anxious, however, I do feel optimistic and think that we will soon come out of this situation we are in. I am worried about my family and would not want them to come down with this virus. I feel the government is doing everything they can at the moment to combat the situation and feel satisfied with their efforts at this moment in time. I also think, that as a society we will benefit from this in the long term as we will learn new habits such as washing your hands coming back from the grocery store or taking precautions.
