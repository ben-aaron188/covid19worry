I feel sad for the number of people who have lost a loved one to the illness. I feel worried that when things return to 'normal' that society will have changed for the worse. I feel angry that people have become selfish. I also feel incredibly lonely and isolated - I live alone and I worry about elderly people who are in the same situation.

I work in mental health and recognise that others are struggling just as much. I'm concerned that this lockdown period will lead to a lot of anger, domestic violence, divorce, child abuse. People have lost their jobs and the suicide rate is likely to increase.
