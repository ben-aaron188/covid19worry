I feel very frustrated that I'm isolating, and therefore cant see my family, and particularly can't help my grandma.
I feel very grateful to the NHS workers who are so brave and putting their lives at risk.
I am enjoying spending quality time with my husband and stepson, but we don't have a garden and I'm really missing the fresh air.
I am worried about how long this will last for, and I am sad for all of the events that have been cancelled this summer that i was really looking forward to. I am disappointed to have had to cancel my holiday.
However, I am grateful that my loved ones are safe and well, but I am worried that any of them will contract Corona.
