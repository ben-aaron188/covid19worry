Extremely concerned for loved ones who are more vulnerable than me. Anxious about being able to order/collect meds in a timely manner without risking infection, and fearful of shopping for food and other vitals. It's not the shopping itself, although that is potentially fraught with hidden dangers, it's more the thought of having to queue with strangers that worries me. In a bigger picture, is this the quiet apocalypse? IF not, then how long will we be under these restrictions, and will they get worse before they get better? Too many questions.
