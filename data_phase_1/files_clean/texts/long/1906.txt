I feel very fearful about the Coronovirus situation. I'm worried for myself and my partner and our families if we get sick. Within our family there are family members with MS and COPD who we are even more worried about. I am sad that I can't see my family for goodness knows how long, but this is for the best as I wouldn't want to risk giving them anything. I'm worried about work and money, I'm on zero hours agency and my partner maybe being furloughed soon and we are already struggling. I'm angry about the people who aren't listening to the stay in rules and who are just going about things as normal and not caring and seeing friends and family. I think that the country should be put on full lockdown, with no outdoor exercise and strictly only allowed out once a week for food and medicine and that's it. The sooner we lockdown fully and stop these people going out and ignoring the rules, the sooner this virus stops and the sooner life can get back to normal. But the government needs to be firmer with these people not listening or caring.
