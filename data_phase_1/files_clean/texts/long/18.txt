I am very worried about this situation, about how long this will last due to myself, my mother and others having depression or other mental health problems. Also about the vulnerable within my family and other. As well as the children from the special needs school I work at how they are dealing with this and if they are healthy and not suffering. I also am greatful for the teachers, support workers, NHS staff and carers taken care of others who need it.
