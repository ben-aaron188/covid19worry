I feel worried - mainly about my family members. I have a daughter with asthma,  a brother with leukaemia and a mother who had chemo a couple of years ago. 
I felt angry and frustrated initially as things didn't happen quick enough - such as social distancing and closing schools. 
I also felt frustrated at the lack of clarity from the government - there was lots of initial guidance put forward but with little direction and instruction - the school situation being a prime example. There had been no dialogue with schools before making the announcement to close. No forewarning.  Once the decision had been made people were left to intemperate it how they saw fit which left it open to abuse and my wife's school had 76 families out of 250 expecting to still be able to send their kids to school
