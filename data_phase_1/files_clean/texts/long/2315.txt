The situation is very scary for everyone in this world what it means for us today, tomorrow and in years to come. Our futures and that of our children. I worry for my daughter more than I do for myself. 

Lives are being lost, jobs are diminishing and businesses are closing. Recessions will be the next steps and a further reason to worry will be evident. 

We will loose many people and our materialistic lives will change but only temporarily. 

I fear for what will come before it gets better and when I will see my family again and of it will be in good health or not. 

I will not take things for granted is a common thought which will be short lived by many but not all. Not me.
