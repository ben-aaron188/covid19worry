I feel fearful, as we don't know who or where it is coming from.
We cannot physically see this virus and this is frightening.
I go to work daily in the NHS seeing patients on wards and in the out patients department, not knowing if my colleagues or myself will get this virus. We can only do our best by trying to distance ourselves and hand wash/sanitise but this is difficult when you have to take a blood sample off someone.
I know people blame our government for not issuing the correct PPE, but no one would have been prepared for this pandemic no matter how much planning was in place. 
People need to remember how serious this is, and keep their distance and not go out.
FRIGHTENED !!!!
