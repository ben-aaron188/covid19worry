Very worried not so much for myself but family members. Grandparents which are elderly. A father who is a delivery driver and out and about in it. The rest of the family work in education.
Frustrated about the not known element of it - when will it end, how long will it go on for etc?
Finding isolating and staying at home hard
Struggling with lack of routine.
I am a key worker but days are sporadic so its hard to adjust to different circumstances etc. I am a teacher and am now working in a hub school.
