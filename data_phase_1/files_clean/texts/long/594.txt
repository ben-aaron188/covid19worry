I am Nervous as it hugely affects both mine and my wife’s industry as we work in hospitality. The Spain and Italy situations gives us hope that we are only a few weeks from the outbreak slowing. I am very frustrated at the people abusing the lockdown and going out on the weekend as it’s incredible selfish and stupid. Very sad to not be spending Easter weekend with my mum and family, feels odd to not have any plans but I am going to make the most of it and cook a big meal for us and possibly try and deliver some to local people who are alone
