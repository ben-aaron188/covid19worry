It's dangerous and is not being taken seriously enough. People are still ignoring the lockdown rules and I am sad because I am stuck in my house alone and if they keep doing this I am going to be alone for a long time. I wish people would take it seriously as my university has been cancelled too which is stressful as well. I am sad that the lockdown is being extended as my first holiday in over 10 years is being cancelled and k was really looking forward to it as a celebration of my graduation. I am disappointed that I never got to say goodbye to my university friends and I will miss them
