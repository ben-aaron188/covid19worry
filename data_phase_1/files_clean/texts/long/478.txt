I am very sad for the families who have lost loved ones, but it has been amazing how the situation has brought out the best in people. I put a simple thank you on my rubbish bins today but my neighbour put on a rainbow with the following message: Good morning! Thank you, as always, to you and your team in keeping us all going in these times. The highlight of the week is currently taking out the bins out. Best wishes to you and your family. Keep safe. I have never been as busy sending out newsletter to our hostelling group and keeping in touch with members not on email. I hope the close contacts we have made with neighbours will continue once the pandemic is over.
