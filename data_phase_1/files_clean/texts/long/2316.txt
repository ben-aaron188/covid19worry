I am very sad, worried, upset, frustrated and angry. We have had to move our wedding from May 2020 to May 2021 (and our honeymoon was also cancelled, along with our hen and stag dos) so it’s obviously been a very emotional time for us - particularly as we were going to start a family afterwards. I’ll be 37 by the time we’re married so this is a huge worry for me. I feel angry and sad that our plans are being put on hold for a year and it feels like this whole year is being wasted. My anxiety has been horrendous although it has improved a little since my fiancé’s workplace finally closed and he has been home, safe. I have a compromised immune system due to chronic illnesses and the whole situation terrifies me. Both our mums and other family members are at higher risk too and I’ve been so worried. None of us caused this situation, yet the whole world has been affected by it. It’s so surreal and unbelievable.
