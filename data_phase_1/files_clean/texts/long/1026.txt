I am very concerned and worried for the vulnerable. I am also worried about not being paid enough from work.

Lots of shops, pubs and restaurants will probably fold as a result, which depresses me. 

I have had tension headaches for the past two days.

It's very difficult not being able to go out and meet up with friends and family.

I am enjoying getting out in the garden to grow my own food though. I am keeping in touch with my family and friends via WhatsApp, Facebook and phone calls.

I think the government should have locked down earlier.
