I am fortunate in my situation with a stable job and limited risk to the virus but worry about others who are more at risk and have suffered economically as well. I worry for the unfortunate who have been severley affected, and can't say a proper goodbye to the deceased. I am anxious about how we will respond and if we will learn from this event, or if we will carry on as if nothing has happened. I am angry at those taking advantage of those who are vulnerable, e.g price gouging. I think those who have tried to profit of of the situation are disgusting. I feel for those who are lonely and are suffering mentally as well as physically.
