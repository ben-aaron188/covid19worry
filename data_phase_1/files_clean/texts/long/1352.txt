This virus is causing my household much anxiety, worry and anger between myself and husband. As we are both not working in the meantime, we are stuck in limbo. All my husband does is sits in front of telly all day with a pack of lager while I am doing all the household chores.
I am becoming more agitated every passing day. I can only pray this virus gets a cure very soon. Every day I watch the same rubbish telly programmes, listen to the daily update from the Government but still hoping our lock down will end soon.
