I am Currently feeling anxious and afraid for my friends and family and sadness for the people dying. I am also anxious for the amount of time we are locked down for and the economic consequences that this will ha e in the future both on a personal level and for businesses. I am also very angry at the people who appear not to be following the governments restrictions. I currently think the government are handling the situation as best they can given the unprecedenet circumstances we all go d ourselves in.
