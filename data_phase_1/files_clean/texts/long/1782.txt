feeling boxed in like i should be doing more. theres all this time now to get stuff done but little motivation. the prospects of not being able to work all through summer is deffinatly worrying. mainly because im missing out on this great experience, i really need the money for tuition and it will look great on my cv. 

its also very sad the images of people dead as the death toll increases, all that sadness. I have read all these stories of how this has been really good for the environment and i think to myself where peoples priorities lie. truthfully maybe so, but i would hope all resources and media coverage wold be going towards shedding light on areas where covid-19 has left communities lacking. raise awearness on how to provide medical equipment to hospitals and food to the needy.

Now my feelings towards the current economic effect; firstly I dont know much in this area. from the little i know, i figure the government should worry less about the hit the economy will take post covid-19 and focus on taking care of the needs of the people on a personnal basis. because no matter what the citizens will remember this and can channel this back when its time to re-build the economy when this is all over. God help us in Jesus name.
