I'm angry at the Chinese for being so incompetent and barbaric that they opened Pandora's Box on the world.
I'm also angry at the Chinese for trying to take advantage of this pandemic by selling sub-standard and even dangerous medical equipment and supplies.
I'm angry that despite it being China's fault, any criticism you have has you labeled as being a Sinophobe or a racist by media shills and Left-leaning idiots.
I'm worried that my more vulnerable (in health) family members will become sick.
I'm irritated by the UK lock-down measures and social-distancing guidelines.
I'm angry at how people are panic-buying and over-reacting on certain things.
I'm angry at how the prices of hand-sanitizer and disinfectant, products I've regularly had to buy and use for years due to pre-existing health-issues, are now sky-high or impossible to find.
I'm worried about the economy and how it'll affect me and mine.
I'm worried that pets can become hosts, become ill, or become vectors for infection, and I'm angry because that implies nothing natural about the virus' origins.
I'll reiterate, and to be crude: fuck China. It's their fault, be it through abominable cultural and hygiene practices (mixing bush-meat with domestically-sourced meat in wet markets) or being as competent as Soviet nuclear researchers were in the 1940's with biological research/development, if the virus was engineered in someway, for some purpose.
