I feel Very confused and stressed. I don’t know what’s going to happen about my mortgage or my rent payments or how to pay all the bills when my job has cut my pay and hours, though I still have to go in. I was also supposed to be starting a new teaching job in September and gaining some in class experience by viewing the current class sessions with their teacher, find out what levels they’re at, how they teach, the schools dialling system etc. I’m also upset about my current job and if about my school will  reopen. I haven’t been able to give the children s proper send off or say goodbye as I won’t still be there in September. Some of the children are experiencing loss and I can’t be there for them which also upsets me. I’m confused and anxious as we have no idea what’s going on or what to compare this to. I’m also angry that people still aren’t obiding by the rules enforced. Also, nothing is more irritating than being isolated with a lazy partner and a screaming 3 year old that doesn’t understand why we can’t go outside.
