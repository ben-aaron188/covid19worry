I am scared that my family will become infected. Members of my family are high risk and could easily be lost to this virus.

I am angry at those who are not following government guidelines. They are prolonging this situation by still going out and not practicing social distancing.
I am stressed bout feeding my family without endangering them by going out. As i am carer for my partner, I have had to isolate with him and our young sons. Otherwise i would bot be able to provide the needed assistance.
I am grateful for my friends support. Without these people we would have run out of food a long time ago.
