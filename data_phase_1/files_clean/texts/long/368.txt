On a personal level I feel fine - I am not worried about contracting it as I am fit and healthy, but I am concerned about passing it on to others. I am enjoying being at home and trying new things but I am furious that we live in a society that allows people to starve to death and one where money has so much power. I am disgusted at hearing a monarch speak who has absolutely no idea just how difficult it is for those who are marginalised - sex workers, asylum seekers etc. and how tired I, and many others are, having to create food parcels and distribute as our local councils seem to be unable to function. I am furious as she has no idea how difficult this is for homeless people or those who live in tiny 20 floor flats or who are alone and scared.
