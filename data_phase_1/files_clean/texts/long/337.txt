I am anxious about the lockdown - how this affects the children and people's mental health, their jobs, their futures, our children's education. I worry about people trapped in homes with unstable people and the effects this will have on them now and in the future.
I am anxious about not having a lockdown - people i know and love getting very ill and possibly dying or having long term effects from it, suffering unneccessarily.
Not knowing how long this will go on for, and the lack of control that anyone/the government has is all really scary.
