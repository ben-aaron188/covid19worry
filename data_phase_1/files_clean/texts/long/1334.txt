Sad towards those who don’t follow the guidelines to help prevent the spreading of corona virus and for everyone to be able to eventually get back to normality when this is under control. Upset with the losses from the virus but glad lots of people have managed to recover. Disappointed action wasn’t taken sooner by the government to contain the spreading earlier on to prevent such losses and intense lockdown measures. Upset I can’t enjoy the sun with my friends back at university and spending times at pubs. Hopefully the level of testing increases and the NHS are able to get the PPE that they need to avoid any chances of caching the virus.
