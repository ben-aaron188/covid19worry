I am very concerned about losing a loved one to Covid 19. My anxiety is lessening but I feel people aren’t taking social distancing seriously. If things don’t change then I see the lockdown lasting much much longer than is currently planned. It’s good to see that the death rate is progressing more slowly than what was initially predicted but it’s still worrying how many people are losing their lives, especially those working on the frontline in key services. I don’t really have much else to say on this subject and feel a minimum five hundred character limit on a response is somewhat excessive. If someone has an opinion, they can convey if concisely instead of waffling on unnecessarily just to meet a given number of characters.
