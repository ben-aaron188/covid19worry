I do feel anxious about the long term impact. I'm anxious about businesses and the economy. My own job could be under threat and I feel that many bars, pubs and restaurants simply won't bounce back from this. I am feeling sad that I don't get to go out too far from my house and I miss my friends and family. I am sad for those that live alone or who are ill. I'm incredibly sad for people who have died alone and will not get proper funerals. I'm angry at Boris Johnson and his team for not taking this seriously enough in the first place. I fucking hate Donald Trump and the only upside of all this may be that he gets voted the fuck out.
