Bored mainly.I cant do anything. frustrated about the lack of clarity and plans. As I sit in my flat, contemplating the week ahead, I am so grateful for the time I have shared with my loved ones, my family and friends, even if it wasn’t in person. We are the privileged and the lucky ones.

It is easy to see the negatives and what we have lost on a personal level through this pandemic, but let us not forget how fortunate we truly are. Isolate and protect yourselves – do it for yourself and for those around you, because we can. And there are those who can’t.
