I have a sick father. He is 65 years old. It is very difficult for us to experience. He may die. Doctors say everything will be fine but I don't believe it's just a horror of some kind. a lot of my friends got sick. I think the government is silent on the real statistics of infected and deaths. I fear for my life and the life of my family. I pray for us. good god. The stores run out of products. no one brings up new ones. What happens next? I don't know, but you need to hold on and not be discouraged
