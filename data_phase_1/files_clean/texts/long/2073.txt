I feel pretty worried about the situation. I am a third year university student so I don't know where I lie in terms of graduation and being able to swiftly move on from uni life to working life. I am worried about my parents as they work for the NHS. They aren't frontline staff but still have to see patients. I think that the situation is grave - obviously doesn't discriminate as Boris Johnson is now in intensive care. I am worried about what this means for the country, and am worried about him as well.
