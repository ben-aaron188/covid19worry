This outbreak situation is of great concern to me. Many of my friends have lost their jobs. The government is not helping. The money is running out. In the shops queue. Food is running out. I'm shocked! How it is possible to live. I'm tired of the bad news. My family is suffering. We can't walk down the street normally. We are afraid to get infected.
I worry about my work colleagues
I constantly worry about my parents.
I am afraid our medical system may not cope with many patients!
I am afraid of losing my savings!!!
