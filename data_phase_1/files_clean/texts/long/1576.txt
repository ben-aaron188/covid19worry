My husband has just been out to get essential food which made me anxious of him going out of the house. Other than that I feel relaxed when we are all in the house and I know we are doing the right thing by staying in.

I get angry when I read on social media about people meeting up and going out. And sadness for the many many people that have lost their lives. 

I get annoyed when I watch the press conference as the journalists seem to be asking the same questions over and over. I wish they would think harder over the questions they are asking as they are getting repetitive now.
