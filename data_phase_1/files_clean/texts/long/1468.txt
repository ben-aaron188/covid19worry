I feel sad at the state of the world and country - that people are dying, care workers are dying trying to save people and do their job, domestic abuse is rising, the living conditions of so many families in this country who are now cooped up inside. I don't feel that the government are supporting health workers or the poorest and most vulnerable in society and that makes me angry. 

I am anxious about my own situation and my family and friends, and fear that something could happen to them and I wouldn't be able to help. I feel lonely.
