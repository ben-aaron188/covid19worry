At this very moment, I feel happy and relaxed because I have just finished work and I am working from home. My family are all working from home too and so far everyone is safe. I feel anxious to watch the news and worried that someone I know will get ill. I feel sad if I think about all of the people who are ill at the moment or who have lost someone. I feel as though the world is a bit much for me to bare right now and the best way for me to deal with it is to keep busy and try not to worry myself about things I can't control.
