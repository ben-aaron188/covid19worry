I'm getting more and more worried about the coronavirus situation around the world. It scares me that my family and my cats could catch the virus, more than me getting it myself. I am trying to limit my news and media exposure to try and manage the anxiety that I feel. Most days I do feel a bit teary at some point. I was talking to a work colleague today who broke down in tears because of the isolation she is feeling at the moment. I feel like a lot of the time people are putting on brave faces, but actually this isn't an ordinary thing to happen. It isn't easy to change my way of life but I feel like staying at home and being careful is the best action to protect the people that I care about.
