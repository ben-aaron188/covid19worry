I am absolutely terrified. I have asthma and I am scared to leave the house. Every time my husband goes to the shop and home I make him take his clothes off and wash them as soon he gets in. I'm scared of dying from this and I'm terrified anyone close to me gets this virus. It is becoming increasingly worrying and closer to home. I am furiously looking at the news constantly and hoping for remedies and prevention techniques to help myself fight this horrendous virus. I have a 2 year old child and the thought of leaving him without a parent is just unimaginable. Thinking that he might get it is horrific, I'm utterly terrified and so anxious about the situation.
