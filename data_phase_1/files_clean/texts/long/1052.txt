I am anxious about it, particularly as I am a nurse and cannot avoid coming into clost contact with other people (staff and patients) who might be carrying the virus. I am anxious that I might transmit it to my family. I am sad and worried because my elderly father is in a care home and I can't see him and I can hardly bear to think about the possibility of him getting it and dying without his family. I am also angry at the government for not reacting swiftly enough, and for making such huge cuts to the NHS and other public services that it cannot cope with this crisis.
