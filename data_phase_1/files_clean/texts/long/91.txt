Generally I'm saddened by this coronavirus outbreak. Although I am relaxed about mine & my family's health, the loss of life around the world from the pandemic itself and the repercussions are upsetting. I fear for the future of the world, economically and socially. Alternatively, I see the blessing of the virus in revealing inadequacies in society which must be addressed for the future. Finally, I'll note that my fears regarding international relations are growing due to the vulnerability of the world. I had hoped a global pandemic would provoke nations to come together with honesty and good will, however it appears the opposite has occurred with China and USA being examples of countries failing to be cohesive or transparent both internally and externally.
