its a bad thing.everyone should stay at home safe. and I'm a little bit scared about the virus, because it can come to my house. and i don't know how would it go to all my family. we have a newborn and his immune system isn't strong yet. we don't want to loose him. what if the virus comes here?what will we do? who will come to help us? we will panic. we will be useless. and no one will help us. because too many people will be in a queue for tests and help. there would be more inportant people in priority.
