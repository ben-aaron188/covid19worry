Sadness that so many people are losing their lives and that their families won’t be able to say goodbye as they normally would. A little fear for those impacted by the virus, especially those losing their jobs. Worry for those in isolation and the impact of loneliness, especially the elderly and single people who aren’t living with family and pets. Frustration towards those not taking social distancing seriously. Huge amount of respect for those working during this time, NHS, delivery drivers, shop workers etc.
