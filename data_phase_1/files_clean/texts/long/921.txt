I feel frustrated because a lot of things have been taken away from me, such as my ability to see my friends and family, to go to classes, to take part in exams. As a final year student, this is exacerbated since I won't be able to see some of my classmates indefinitely and the change in assessment style is stressful. It is also frustrating that not everyone is taking the lockdown seriously, which makes it more dangerous for other people and it will prolong restrictions for longer than necessary - it makes the effort that I'm putting into adhering to guidelines feel futile.
