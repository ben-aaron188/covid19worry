I am very anxious at the moment. I have generalised anxiety disorder, and usually my mood is well controlled and stable. This current situation however has undone a lot of the work I've managed to do in the past few years to take control of my mental health.
As a microbiologist, I have volunteered to work in one of the government testing centres and I feel like this will help me manage my anxiety however, as it will help me feel like I have a part to play in managing the situation. Other than that, I am sadder than usual, and I feel like I have lost faith in some people who are not taking the advice and warnings of the WHO and government seriously.
