I am a little bit stressed about what is going to happen in the future, and whether all my relatives and I will stay safe. However, my work is going well, I am fine being at home, I have a home, I have enough food, I have freelance jobs that allow me to not only save money but also to earn some. I am generally quite happy with this situation, as much as it is stressful. I decided not to go home where I am from but stay in London instead. I think it is much better to be stuck in isolation on my own than with family/friends, because if you want to see someone - you have videochats, but if you don't want to you have ways of escaping (you are already on your own). So I think it is one of the reasons I feel so good now, because I don't have anyone to annoy me.
