I'm finding the Corona situation quite daunting and draining. I can't wait for it to end, and for things to get back to normal. I feel things will not be the same again.it's left so many families devastated. I feel so sad for the families that have lost loved ones,  both old and young. For those that are fighting for their lives, I hope they pull through.  I have hope that all will be well in the end.  This shall pass, we shall overcome this by God's grace. We are all in this together as this situation has affected the whole world and not just certain parts of it. I salute all those working in the frontline, the NHS and all those volunteering at this time.
