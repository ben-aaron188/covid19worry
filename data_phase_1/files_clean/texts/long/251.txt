I am confused by the food situation
I have a state of constant anxiety because of the epidemic.
I'm worried about my family.
I worry about my work colleagues
I constantly worry about my parents.
I am afraid our medical system may not cope with many
I very worry about my work. I may lose my job because of this epidemic.
I am afraid of losing my savings.
I'm running out of food and I'm scared to go outside. I have no mask. I do not know what to do. Why such a shortage of everything? Why isn't the government helping us?
