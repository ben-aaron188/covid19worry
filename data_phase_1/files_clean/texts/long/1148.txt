It's sad the number of deaths. People need to respect rules but should still be allowed daily exercise. Government could of acted quicker than they did. Sad as in spring and waited all winter to go in Snowdonia and weather turns good as soon as we in lock down. Wasted money for university this year as with this and strikes very little coverage and online stuff useless. I feel sad also that I may not be able to go away and enjoy my final summer before graduation and no chance to get a driving licence or work. Hopefully the situation will change in the near future and can enjoy the summer.
