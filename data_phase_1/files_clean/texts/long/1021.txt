I am pleased that we have taken steps to control the virus in the UK by way of the lockdown. I feel sad for the people who have lost their lives and those who have lost people they know from the virus. I am hopeful the lockdown is working as I believe most people are taking it seriously and I hope this means things will get back to normal before too long and the economy will pick up. 
I feel this will be forever remembered in history and we will look back and tell others about our different experiences.
