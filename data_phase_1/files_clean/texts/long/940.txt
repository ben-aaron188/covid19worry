I am feeling anxious about what will happen next and am worried about what sort of world we are going to be in once this is all over.
On a personal level I am  currently not able to work and do not qualify for any of the help available so am  worried about how long this will last because it will have financial implications.
I have felt quite relaxed over the last few weeks because it felt like I was on holiday but the reality is now sinking in and concerns are growing about how long this will go on .
