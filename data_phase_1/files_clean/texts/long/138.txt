I feel extremely anxious, sad and unsettled. I can’t sleep, I had a few panic and anxiety attacks in the past month. 
My employment situation is up in the air with my employer saying that he’ll furlough me, then changing his mind and then changing his mind again.
I’m scared because I might not be able to support myself, scared to catch the virus, scared that I have no family in UK and my grandad in my home country has coronavirus and is in the hospital and not doing well and is in his late 70s.
I’m scared and anxious and tired. My anxiety is through the roof and I can’t wait for all people to just follow the rules and for this all to be over.
