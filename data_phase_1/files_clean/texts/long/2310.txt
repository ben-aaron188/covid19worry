Really scare situation. I am worried about my family my loved ones. I feel what if something goes wrong. I really want to do something to help everyone  in this situation. I don't want anyone to die anymore. Really want to see the change as quick as possible. I Hope the government helps the poor people, to get their jobs back and everything goes normal again. There are certain group of people not talking this serious and roaming around and spreading and passing  the virus to everyone . This people should be punished and not given any medical treatment if they get the infection. They not worried about their loved ones or care about them then why should they be given any treatment. This is fun time for them they don't care about our NHS and all the worker who is working hard to get back to normal but because of this few people everyone will suffer. God bless our country.
