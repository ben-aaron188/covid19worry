i feel very worried about the Corona situation because fear for the will being of my family and friends as well as the the economical effects. for example food expensiveness going up as well as my mental health. most important consern is for my family and my children because they are at the most risk and my elderly relatives such as my mother who also has other medical conditions, that buts her at most risk, the other thing i am worried about is not able to travel, because traveling and socialising with friends and family is very important to me
