I sometimes feel a little bit fed up and sad but I also sometimes feel relaxed and am enjoying spending time with my family. It's kinda a weird situation for me but I know we will get through this together. I/we need to be patient and get through this because I the end our wellbeing is most important for all. The coronavirus will not beat us, we will win this in the end. I can't wait to see my family again in its entirety when this is over. Tomorrow is another day in which we have to ensure everyone possible stays safe and well.
