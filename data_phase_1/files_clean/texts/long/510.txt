I feel somewhat concerned about the current Corona situation, but more than anything I am anxious to see my friends and family again, and am sad that currently I cannot do so. I hope that the Corona situation will be resolved sooner rather than later, hopefully with the development of a vaccine, but even if it's just herd immunity. I am not particularly stressed about the virus itself, and perhaps I should be, but it's hard when I know no one affected and thus it's still quite abstract for me. Nevertheless I am following the UK government's suggested protocols, as regardless of whether I am concerned I don't wish to be exposed/expose others to the virus.
