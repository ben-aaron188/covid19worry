I have just found out that even though 80 percent of my workforce has been furloughed. I have not been chosen. This means I have still got a number of months unsure of my rostering, unable to plan or get a second job. I feel that my colleagues who have been furloughed are less anxious and also will be financially better off. I am getting bored and frustrated at home but also anxious how we are going to emerge out of this at the other end. This seems a distant future. Regards catching the virus I am not too worried as I feel I am relatively strong and healthy and have been maintaining a healthy amount of exercise and eating well to keep my immune system strong. I am missing physical interactions with people.
