Anxious and concerned for family members of whom are more at risk than myself, their health is a large cause of concern. Additional stress has been added to everyday life as isolation leads to feeling restricted, it feels almost dirty to think of going for a walk in the park which would have been benign weeks ago.

I am mainly worried about what the future holds and frustrated at the severe negligence that caused these circumstances to begin with. To that point i am angry.

Days blend together with no strict boundaries between activities and lethargy sets in quickly, in terms of some of the aspects this survey probed, i feel little expression in terms of desire or happiness as my feelings and motivations turn to apathy.
