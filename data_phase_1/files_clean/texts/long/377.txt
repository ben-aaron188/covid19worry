I am currently ‘furloughed’ from work as all of our customers are closed, I have never not worked so this in itself causes me anxiety as I worry about how our company will recover. 
I am angry our Govt didn’t take precautions earlier; we should have banned travellers from certain areas quicker and been much quicker to test people to determine whether they have the virus. 
The people who are not sticking to the rules should be dealt with much more strongly to deter them. Myself and my family (who all live a minimum of an hour away) are all sticking to the rules but we will suffer because of others not sticking to the rules.
