I have had a breakdown in my mental health. I work for the NHS and have had to take 2 weeks leave as I am that scared. My trains no longer get me to work on time and I am constantly worried about family members. I know of 3 people who have been tested positive so far and also know someone who has passed away from it. I have become quite depressed and withdrawn. I think that it is very sad that many people are losing their lives. As someone with a background in medical research, I am also interested in the research that will be produced from this pandemic and I am trying to follow it closely.
