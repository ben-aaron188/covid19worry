I’m worried about my older relatives getting the virus and possibly dying. I’m anxious about my job situation and that of my immediate family. I have had my contract hours cut and my little brother has been made redundant. My partner has only been self employed for 10 months so gets no help from the government either. I’m scared for my mum, who has some serious underlying health conditions. If she gets the virus, it is likely that she will die. I’m angry that people are ignoring the social distancing rules. I’m concerned that my mental health will deteriorate if the lockdown lasts much longer.
