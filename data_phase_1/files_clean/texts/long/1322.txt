I’m starting to struggle today - I feel restless but also quite down, and as if everything I do is meaningless. I’m trying to stay positive but I’m frightened of my loved ones getting sick or dying, I’m worried about money, and I’m worried about how society will change after this. I’ve been quite positive until now so I think this is a bad day - I feel exhausted, anxious and sad. It frustrates me that others (a minority) are ignoring advice about social distancing, although I have seen a great deal of considerate behaviour. Trying to stay upbeat but it’s hard!
