I am feeling slightly worried for my elderly relatives and the economic situation of the country as a whole. Regardless of these factors, overall I am relatively calm as the lockdown has barely had an effect on my living situation and daily activities. I am dissatisfied with how the situation has been handled by the government in the way that we had the opportunity to analyse other countries responses that were ahead of us in the peak of the virus yet we chose to do basically nothing instead with a reactionary response as opposed to preventative.
