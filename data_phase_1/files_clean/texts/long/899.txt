It is a very worrying time, as there are many shortages in shops and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to get essential items. It’s also very concerning how rapidly the number of cases and number of people dying from coronavirus each day is increasing, despite being under lockdown. I hope that tougher measures can help to get the situation under control, in order to help protect those most vulnerable. It is also worrying that frontline workers have not got the essential equipment needed to look after those suffering, as they are risking themselves to help save lives, which I hope can be improved soon.
