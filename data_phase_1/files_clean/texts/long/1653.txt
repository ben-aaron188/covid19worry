I feel worried that we haven't done enough to contain this issue and that we started far too late. I'm worried for my parents who are at risk and for my job. I do not believe our government is competent or honest, I believe they have botched and will continue to botch this problem. 

It's good that they've taken steps to help the economy but I imagine they'll need to go further. When this is over a lot of these measures should continue - to genuinely provide help in society for those that need it most.
