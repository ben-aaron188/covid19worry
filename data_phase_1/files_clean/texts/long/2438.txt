I am anxious and worried about the future and how drastically life has changed. I am worried about not be able to make plans or enjoy events such as family birthdays. I miss not being able to visit family that upsets me and makes me sad. It is scary hearing and watching the news about how many people have died with the coronavirus. I miss the normal day to day tasks such as going shopping for clothes or meeting my friends or going on family day outs. Also I do not know if I am doing enough to protect myself and my family from the virus such as handwashing or wearing protective equipment.
