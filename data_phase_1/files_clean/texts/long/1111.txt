Currently I have an array of emotion. I feel anxious and fearful for the future it is likely that me and my partner (who both work for the same company) will be furloughed, my partner earns considerably more than me and with the government cap at 2,500 before tax I don’t know how we’re going to cope. We have no savings and whilst I agree our combined earnings were more than perhaps some of my family and friends it was in no way above the national average and our our goings for bills is quite high. I’m also fearful we will end up losing our jobs and with the country on its knees economically I can’t see getting another job as an easy task.

I am sad as I miss my two young nieces immensely, we would look after them fortnightly whilst my sister worked and I miss them so much. At that age they change so quickly.

I am content that currently we have a nice house for me and my partner and my son to shelter in and that we have each other with no health issues yet but I feel guilt for feeling this when I do because of all the pain others are experiencing. I feel useless that I should be doing more to make a difference when it comes to my grandchildren one day asking me what I did I’ll only be able to answer stay inside. 

I feel fearful that we may catch the virus I get extreme anxiety food shopping it reminds me of an apocalypse. 

I have hope when I see people coming together and helping to best this disease from nurses to food delivery drivers and I am immensely proud of my country. As you can see a whole rainbow of emotions.
