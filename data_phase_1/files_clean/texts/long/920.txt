I'm scared and anxious I don't know the best way to put it into words. We don't know what each day is going to hold. People arnt paying attention to how serious this is and putting others at risk. I feel so nervous thinking about the future how it will it affect jobs. Money travel. Will I survive if I catch covid 19. Why has it happened. Right now my heart is pouncing. Hands are clammy. When I have to leave the house and I see someone I could cry what happens if they have the virus and what if they pass it on to me. I'm also so sad hearing about the other key workers who have to face it all on a daily basis
