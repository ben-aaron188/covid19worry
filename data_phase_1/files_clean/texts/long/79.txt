The NHS staff are not protected enough and the guidelines in supermarkets are not being followed social distancing needs to be stricter. 
The media needs to address more positive stories to boost moral as many people have died yet many have survived and there is only talk about those who have passed away not who have beat it. I feel there needs to be a punishment for those acting inappropriately such as seeing friends social gatherings as despite warning the few are still ignoring. Families in supermarkets should not be allowed single parents as an exception but couples coming into shops with children should be tuned away and only one member allowed in, its pointless closing schools yet allowing children to run around the shops (which is happening still)
