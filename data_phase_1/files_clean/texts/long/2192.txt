I am quite angry by the way this has been dealt with and how people have reacted. It was delayed for too long which caused more deaths and some of the general public are living their life normally like there isn't a virus going around. Unfortunately, one of my family members have died of the corona virus. People must stay indoors and abide by the rules or we will all be trapped in our houses for a very long time. This virus has changed my life, my kids are at home and it is stressing me out so I hope we can go back to normal as soon as possible.
