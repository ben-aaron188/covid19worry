The current situation fills me with anxiety over the uncertainty of the whole situation.  When will it end and will I become seriously ill.  When will I be able to resume my normal life again.  How will my mother receive treatment for her diagnosis of lung cancer and when will I get to visit her safely.  I feel upset that some people are not following the social distancing guidelines and when they come within the required two meters feel that they are putting me at risk.  I am also currently in the middle of moving to an overseas house and have had to leave it empty.  I have many commitments and am not sure when  I will be able to complete them.
