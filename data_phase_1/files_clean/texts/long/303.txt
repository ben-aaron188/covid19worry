I feel anxious and worried that my family might get the virus and I won't be able to help them. I'm concerned we aren't testing enough people and that the NHS doesn't have the resources to cope with the surge. I worry that the general public are not taking the social distancing seriously especially with Easter coming up.  There are still too many people out and about whi aren't following the rules. I'm also worried my employer will have to make redundancies once this is over. when will it end? How can we get back to normal life without a vaccine?
