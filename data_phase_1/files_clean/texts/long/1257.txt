Anxious about the situation and its affects on my friends and family. Looking at news reports and social media makes the anxiety worse. Feel anger at those who do not take the situation seriously and do not follow the rules correctly around social distancing and only going outside for an essential trip like food shopping and outside exercise. However, I look for positive news stories particularly whether the situation is improving as well as the good news stories of people coming together to thank care workers.
