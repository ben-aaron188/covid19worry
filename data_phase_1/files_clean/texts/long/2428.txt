At the moment I’m concerned, feel it hasn’t really hit in our area yet. Worried about family particularly my kids and my parents. Also worried or anxious about the timings and the unknown, how long will it take to get back to the new normal. The uncertainty, worried about work as self employed income has disappeared. 
Also worried on a personal level, I really would rather not get it. As it sounds nasty. 
Staying in is fine but daunting knowing I have 2 kids to teach, business to keep running from home, house to keep. All very daunting, hard work with no end date.
