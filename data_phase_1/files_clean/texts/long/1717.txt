I feel that this coronavirus situation is a very ugly event for humanity. I also feel that it could end up killing tens of thousands, potentially even hundreds of thousands if preventative measures aren't taken.

However, I also believe that we will get through this and be stronger in the end. Hopefully, it will also lead to long term changes in how we work, the economy, etc. I also think that there will be a lot of research done into this virus and how to prevent such a thing from happening again (as well as general virology research).
