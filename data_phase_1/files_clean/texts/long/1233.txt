I am very scared for my loved ones, I don't want them to get it. I am worried about how it will affect my job. I just want things to go back to normal. I feel sad and lonely because I can't see my loved ones that do not live with me. I feel a lot of uncertainty and overall it is a very frightening time. I feel guilty when I complain about anything as it feels like nothing compared to other people. It is hard to know when things will go back to normal so I don't know when I will feel happy again.
