I am very stressed and sad about it as I am a final year undergraduate student, so my final year project write up has been affected so much and I am struggling to focus. all of my exams are now going to be online which is going to be a very strange experience. and my graduation which I have worked so hard for has been postponed, maybe even cancelled. 
to add to this I am at with with my family, and my dad is in the very high risk category which only adds to my stress and anxiety. 
I am overall very stressed and going back to my old depressive ways and partaking in bad habits.
