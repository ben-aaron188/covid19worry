I feel worried ever so slightly about Corona, this is due to the fact I've got loads of food stocked up and prepared so I don't have to leave the house, I got my food delivered anyway so that's no different from normal for me. Plus my company doesn't do work from home so this is also a tiny vacation for me personally anyway.

While I was more panicked/concerned at first I feel like I've reached a point of happiness with it and my current level of supplies and change in habits will stop me catching it
