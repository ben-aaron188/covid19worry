I am in the position where it is likely that I have had Covid-19 and although frustrating that I do not know for certain as there is no testing here unless you are in hospital, I feel almost relaxed like I’ve come out the other side of it and likely that my household are ok too so I do not have any immediate concerns for their health. I had also got very organised with supplies in advance of it arriving here as my sister (a health professional) was taking it incredibly seriously so I took that as a cue that the UK would eventually head the same way as China so therefore we had plenty of supplies at home and had no concerns in that regard although I felt bad for others who were not able to. 
I live a fairly introverted life so not going out has not bothered me in the slightest. It is fairly close to how I live anyway, and I am enjoying having the rest of the household home. I am keeping in contact with work colleagues, friends and wider family with technology and there is a good sense of comaradarie between us. 
I’m finding it really interesting seeing how the world has adapted.
