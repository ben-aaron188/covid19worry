Too much talking and panicking about it in the media. There is no other news. keep repeating numbers that are different every day. that's not good for people's health. I am watching news once a day. Nothing else. Seeing people walking around and obeying instruction given by the government make me feel surprise.
As I am currently indoors forced to go on gov. scheme I am trying to get as much from as I can. Small flat repairs and enjoying sun on my balcony. As much as people may think those instruction did not affect my life that much. Did not affect at all. And fnally toilet paper is back on the shelves ;) 
Currently forced to be home but as we are expecting baby I am quite relaxed and impatient. I have all sort of emotion as any Dad to be would feel. Excitement, Fear, Praying that everything will go well and my both girls will be back home with me at the end of this month.
