I feel sad that so many people are dying with this virus, and all the health professionals struggling to keep as many people alive as they can. My health isn't the best and I have to make sure I stay indoors so I can be safe and not catch the virus.  It can be a little scary and annoying seeing some people disobeying the rules and still going out and acting like everything is ok.
