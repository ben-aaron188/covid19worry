I feel as though this situation is not being taken as seriously as it should be, there appear to be people who are continuing on with their lives as normal with disregard to the rules. This may be due to a lack of personal empathy or education, or simply because they didn't feel the government restrictions were clear enough. Some people don't seem to understand the importance of staying at home, and social distancing as they have not been made aware of asymptotic carriers of the virus. This causes me to become frustrated, and saddened for the NHS and other key workers who are risking their lives.
