just really stressed out as I am not able to go out or anything and I am a carer for my disabled mum and her anxciety as gone through the roof with this situation. So really stressed out trying to keep my mum calm while also worried out how long this situation is going to last.
and being only able to go out once a day for a walk is not doing me any good as I am a not able to get out for myself and it has been stressful trying to get all the shopping I need to keep me and my parents feed for the week as we cannot get a slot for deliver and it means that my dad has to go out to the shops to get the shopping
