Going into week 3 of lockdown I still have some anxiety about getting the virus it is very scary looking at how many people are actually dying from it not just getting a bit poorly, I am not normally an anxious person at all so I donâ€™t know if that actually makes it worse especially as at work and at home people look at me to be the calm one and if I show panic then there really is a problem as I have so many underlying health conditions I think it would be catastrophic for me to get it. Surprisingly I think I have adapted to these new living restrictions quite quickly, the shock has worn off a little and the lockdown measures seem to be being accepted quite readily which gives me some confidence that we will get through this ok
