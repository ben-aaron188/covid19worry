After 3 weeks, slowing down a bit. Noticing people are generally much slower in replying to work emails etc.
By now, I've finished reading the internet & hit the credits on Netflix...
It's Monday and things always speed up on Tuesday though. (I work in live music industry, so not much going on now).
Thanks.
Oh. 500 characters?
Not particularly worried about corona situation at this point, everyone in my area follows the rules, even when out & about.
Missing seeing friends and going to live music. Money is ok for a few weeks. Erm... That's it.
