Anxious about will happen now and in the future and sad that a lot of people are dying and that the government didn't take much stricter actions sooner . I am very angry for those people who are still going out and about and sunbathing even though we are on lockdown. I feel for those that are frontline workers who have to work through this tough time risking there lives and the lives of their family and loved ones.

I am also angry at the government because not enough people are being tested especially frontline workers like doctors, nurses, pharmacists and parademics, bus drivers and supermarket workers etc. They also don't have enough PPE to protect themselves therefore frontline workers are dying because of inadequate protection.
