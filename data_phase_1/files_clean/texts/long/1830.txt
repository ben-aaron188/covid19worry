I feel that the cornavirus is quiet worrying and is making it difficult for me to find motivation or reach my goals at the moment. I think I am getting better at being socialiable remotely and have found some work to do as well as being present in a unique situation, however it is still difficult to feel that this is a good environment and I worry about my mental health at present. I think that today has been particularly bad and my sleeping patterns have been very negative with a lot of difficulty getting to sleep and needing a nap in the afternoon.
