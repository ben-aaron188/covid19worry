I feel very anxious about the current situation with the corona virus. I miss seeing my friends and family and it makes me very sad and upset not to see them but I know how important it is to stay in isolation to reduce/slow down spread of the virus. 
I'm worried about the economy and how it will affect my day to day life after the situation passes. I'm worried about my financial situation in the future. I'm also worried I will not be able to see my family that lives abroad due to travel restrictions.
