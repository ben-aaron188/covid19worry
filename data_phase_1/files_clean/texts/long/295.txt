Scared - currently showing symptoms so I am self-isolating. As a carer & student nurse, I wish I could work as I’m worried about my patients but I also know how important it is to stay away from others in order to reduce the spread. I am worried about those I care for (I predominantly work in elderly care so my patients are very vulnerable with lots of pre-existing conditions); my family and myself. 
I hope my husband and I can use this time positively at least and not just watch tv! I’m worried about my husband as he is currently furloughed and clearly feeling low. All the usual things I would suggest to help can’t be done at the moment.
