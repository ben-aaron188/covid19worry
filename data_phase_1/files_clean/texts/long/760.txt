I feel angry and disgusted at inadequacies in how various governments in the world have reacted to the pandemic. I feel worried for friends who are at risk. I feel hopeful that the urgency will catalyze a growth in awareness of how fragile the capitalist system is among people of the world. I feel lucky and relatively safe in my position at the moment. I feel thankful for and inspired by the efforts of NHS workers, and the efforts of civilians who are supporting them by making face masks and other aid.
