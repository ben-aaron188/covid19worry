Worried because I have to work tomorrow looking after the children of key workers. Angry because some of the children donâ€™t Really need to be there and yet their difficult parents are putting them at risk and lying to us about why they should be classes as key workers. Angry because those children are the worst behaved. Sad because I could catch it and give it to my children. Scared of the future for my children if anything happens to me. Happy because the family time together at home has been nice. I like the improved sense of community that people seem to have but also disappointed that some people are ignoring social distancing rules.
