I think it’s very worrying. It makes me anxious that my friends and family are key workers and exposed to the virus whilst I’m in isolation. It makes me sad that I cannot see my loved ones and that I can’t go outside for anything else than essentials. 
I do feel however that I’ve had more time to spend with my fiancé, as he usually works all the time. Now we have the chance to spend time together. 
I fee that I am trying to eat healthier as I am doing less ex cerise due to the lockdown situation.
