I feel quite anxious and angry about the corona situation at the moment. It seems that it is getting worse over time and i'm afraid the economy will be severely effected resulting in jobs lost. I feel somewhat angry and disgusted at the people who choose to break lockdown rules and go outside in public in big groups not caring about the health and wellbeing of others and potentially spreading the virus making this whole situation last longer, the fact that they feel that because they are not likely be affected by the virus or in danger of it they can go outside is very selfish because it still spreads to those around them that are at risk.
