I am angry about our government not taking it seriously. Not enforcing lockdown as the virus is still spreading and hasn’t peaked. 
I’m scared about catching it and not being able to breath. 
I’m incredibly sad for those who have died alone. This is also something that I really fear! 

I do go out for my walk daily. But I have developed more of a fear of going to the shop for food it seems more risky.
I don’t think we are being given enough information, and direction. 
Italy is still in lockdown. Totally lockdown I do worry and wonder if that time will come for us.

How many more people need to die! 
I’m also hopeful that people will realise there is more to life than social media and money!
