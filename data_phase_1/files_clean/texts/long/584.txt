Currently feeling very deflated with the situation regarding the coronavirus. But understand that taking the steps advised by the government will mean that hopefully we'll be able to get back to normality. I am grateful that I get to spend quality time with some of my family and lucky to be able to still contact close friends and external family. But i'm frustrated when seeing the news that whilst most people are doing the same as me and staying at home, others are ignoring it, and that angers me.
