I think it's very freighting as the whole world is at a stand still and this set back could cost us not just people but also years of our lives. Limit everyone from buying houses and moving up in the world and halting a whole generation down unfairly. So many unanswered questions about whether the NHS is going to be able to cope, if my job is safe, if I can feed my family or if they will be safe in general. I just hope this doesn't carry on and have a knock on effect for not just me or my children but even there children. It was something over nothing to begin with but is a dangerous threat which at the minute doesn't look like it can be stopped or slowed down. I think the government has to fine people for going out at all and only allowed out with notes for a doctors appointment or for a once a week trip to the shops and that's all.
