I feel sad about the rona vrirus,
It's restricted any holiday plans whilst keeping me in isolation which is making me to put on extra weight and feel lazy.
This is very bad for me as it's occurring in a period where I have to revise for my final year exams. To an extent it means I may nit be able to receive exemptions from professional qualifications like ACCA.
I would further continue to say that I 'm also very annoyed at the lack of people who are actually concerned about corona as people are still going to beaches and acting like they're on holiday.
