I am scared about the corona situation because I feel that the government have not prepared enough for the situation, since there was no clear guidelines on how to tackle the issue when it begun. I am therefore afraid of the impact this will have as I fear that too many people will die unnecessarily, especially healthcare workers due to the lack of personal protective equipment. I am scared for my relativesâ€™ safety. I am also angry at the people who do not follow social distancing regulations as it is clear that this is making the situation worse.
