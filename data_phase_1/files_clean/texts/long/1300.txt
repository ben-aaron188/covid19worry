I'm feeling a bit separated from the rest of the world, from my friends and family. I'm worried about the elderly members of my family more than myself. I'm anxious knowing they will leave the house and possibly come into contact with others. I'm relaxed at spending time at home and happy to spend so much time with my boyfriend and his family (in our household). I'm hopeful for the future and that better days will return. I'm frustrated that some people aren't listening to the lockdown rules and could possibly mean we are in this lockdown situation for longer
