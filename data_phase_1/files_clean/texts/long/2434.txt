I feel that this was a man made disease, I have no compassion, my anger is great, but least the animals hopefully will be ok , had to rush my dog to the vets today , she has to have an operation tonight, I can't stay due to regulations , my daughter is off school, I'm worried for the children, depression, not socialising , worried for my eldest , works in a pharmacy , not to wear PPE unless in contact , worried for my elder son , required to work , worried for my mum, she doesn't access internet , she's high risk, but no help available , her doctors surgery in not empithetic , oh I have a long list but doubt if this data will go far
