I feel anxious about what might happen next. There is so much uncertainty. I am worried for friends and family. I wonder how long lockdown will last. I worry they will take away our ability to exercise once daily as it’s something that helps with my mental health. However I am fortunate to have a garden and understand that we need to protect vulnerable people and our NHS.
There is a lot of misinformation which is very frustrating. A lot of squabbling about hoarding and how long it is appropriate to exercise for. It’s difficult to tear myself away from social media and news - I know it’s not helpful for my mental health, it’s exhausting but it’s compulsive.
