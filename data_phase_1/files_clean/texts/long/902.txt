The uncertainty surrounding this virus is causing the anxiety and this is highlighted by the actions of this who are not abiding by the lockdown rules. Seeing people out and about for non essential travel makes me cross as it is going to prolong the time that we have to remain in lockdown. Seeing the number of people who are being taken by this virus is sad and I would just like this to pass as quickly as it came! My husband has been furloughed and I am currently on maternity leave so as lovely as it is to spend time as a family unit we have anxiety surrounding our finances. 

I have a friend who is a paramedic who is witnessing the severity of this virus and I feel so truly proud of her. She is seeing people gasping for their last breaths and seeing them die alone! This again angers me when I see those out sunbathing in the sun! I think something needs to be put in place for this bank holiday weekend to deter people from doing this!
