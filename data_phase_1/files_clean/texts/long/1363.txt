I am very anxious and quite depressed over it, I feel myself being upset and lost and I cant seem to get out of this feeling. I am angry that there isnt a tighter lockdown and that people are still going out. I am nervous and worried about my parents and other family members. I am finding it difficult to not be able to get any alone time or go for a long walk on my own. I am angry that my partner has to work as he works in a hardware store. I cannot wait for it all to be over with. I also feel sad for people who have lost loved ones to this awful virus and fear that I may be in the same situation if a relative dies.
