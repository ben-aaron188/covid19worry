I feel sad about this situation because people are dying and others are not following the rules to stay inside. The NHS has a massive strain now and I'm concerned how they will cope with all of this. It feels like some people are not taking this seriously enough and therefore we will have to continue to live in isolation I just want all this to be over so we can go back to normal life. I feel sad and anxious as if there's no hope and everything feels strange at the moment. Not being able to see my friends and family is making me feel frustrated
