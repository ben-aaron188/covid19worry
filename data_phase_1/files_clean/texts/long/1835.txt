I feel quite anxious about the situation as the future is so uncertain. I am worried about how coronavirus will impact all areas of my own life (social, economic, career, family) alongside society in general and the economy. I donâ€™t see an end in sight which worries me even more. I am concerned that the government is hiding aspects of the epidemic from the public. I am concerned that China has been untruthful with the world and that their death toll is much higher. I am worried that there may be a second wave of the virus which will destroy all of our progress
