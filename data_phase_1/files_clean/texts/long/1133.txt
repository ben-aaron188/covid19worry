I feel very anxious about the pandemic at the moment, I am worried about the health and safety of myself and my family during this time. I am overwhelmed by the news coverage and the fear that is being instilled in us. I am scared to lose people I love to this virus, it keeps me up at night and I am having trouble sleeping. I am feeling frustrated that events I had planned and booked are cancelled and I am losing out on money. I am stressed that my job is under threat and I am now faced with financial insecurity.
