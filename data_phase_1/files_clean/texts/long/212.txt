I just want people to start listening to the government and staying inside so it can be safer sooner. I'm frustrated that people aren't listening. I'm fed up of being stuck in the house and these people are just making it worse.
I'm also worried for my elderly relatives and neighbours. It's so sad that this is happening.
I feel hopeful for the future though. I can't wait for normal life to resume. I hope people have started appreciating things and the people around them more. 
I also feel lucky that we have technology and I'm grateful to have a lot of things keeping me from boredom.
