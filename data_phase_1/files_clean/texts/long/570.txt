very anxious about it all and scared for my family and friends health and also the financial impact on me and the country. wanting to just get back to normality and get back to my work as a taxi driver and hopefully save my credit rating. I'm also angry at the way the governments have dealt with it all and the Chinese for not containing it. hoping that it will be dealt with by august and we can get on with our lives again and hopefully be able to look forward to Christmas this year and then a fresh start in 2021.
