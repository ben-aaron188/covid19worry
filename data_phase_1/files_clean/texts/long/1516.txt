Finding it frustrating due to working as a support worker and seeing the effect it's having on those who have mental health issues and learning difficulties. Specially those who don't understand why things have changed and why they cannot do their normal routines. It's also affecting home life as well due to girlfriend working from home who has mental health issues herself,so managing the two does make me frustrated and sometimes angry. The main thing that bugs me is all the old people I see whenever I'm out shopping. These are meant to be people we are trying to protect however they do not seem to care or in show any regard.
