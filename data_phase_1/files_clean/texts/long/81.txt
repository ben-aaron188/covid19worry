I think not enough was done at the beginning because people weren't aware of how bad it would get. More testing and contact tracing needs done to be able to know where the virus is. 
It's annoying because people aren't following the rules to stay at home and not see people who aren't in their household.
I cant see my boyfriend and rest of my family for who knows how long and loads of people are still out acting as if everything is normal.

There is a constant flow of news about the whole situation which has been giving me some anxiety so i've been trying to not look at the stream of news and information throughout the day and its helping.

I am classed as a key worker and have been provided with some protective gear but the people i work with aren't bothered about wearing it.
