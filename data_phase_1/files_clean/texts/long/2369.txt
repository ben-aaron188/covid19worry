I feel very sad at the moment because I’m missing my friends and family so much. I took for granted how important social contact was for my mental health. I work for the NHS so work has also become more stressful which has increased my anxiety overall. I’m also more agitated on a daily basis as I’m so fed up of being stuck in the house. My partner works in the private sector so I’m also worried about how this will affect us financially in the future. At the moment he still has his job but this could change if the situation carries on for a long period or gets worse. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to which is having a massive impact on my mood.
