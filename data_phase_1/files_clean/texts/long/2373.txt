I feel quite awful about it. People are dying and I can't do anything to help. I am also high risk and am struggling to get shopping etc. Very scary. I also cannot see my parents, who are also vulnerable to the disease. I'm worried they'll get sick. I live alone and I'm worried I'll get sick and not be able to look after my cat. I find it difficult to relax. I am keeping busy and connected with friends etc but I still feel lonely due to the isolation & lack of face to face contact. I find it difficult to be happy and have fun while so many people are dying
