I am self-isolating and going out only to buy the essential items. I am ok about that. I do miss the Gym and Work but I can work from home and do some pull-ups and push-ups. I know if I can get angry but I do remind myself that it won't help. I have to stay positive and keep on for the safety of my family and me. It is what we all have to do. Work together and protect the nation. I do feel that economy will go down if we do not get back to work. I also feel sorry for the people who live paycheck to paycheck and unable to work. I can go on and on. I do apologise for that. Please stay safe and take care, Kleinberg. Regards
