While I am appreciating spending more time at home with my immediate family, I am missing seeing my parents and friends. I don' really like phone calls and prefer face-to-face communications, so it is hard in that respect. I feel a little anxious as to how long this will go on for. I also worry about whether my parents will get ill. It's also hard not having things to look forward to, as you can't plan anything at the moment. I do like having a bit more time to myself (when my son and husband let me!) but I'm also working full time from home so that means I don't have limitless time.
