I feel worries and fearful for the heath of myself, family and friends but am enjoying time at home. I am happy with what the government is doing. I am sick of the stupid media questions though. I am worried for my job and also my family and friends. I am worried we will not be able to go out to exercise soon. I think the government is doing all it can to help everyone. I think people are scaremongering on both social media and in the press. The panic buying and stockpiling is getting on my nerves as it doesnâ€™t help anyone.
