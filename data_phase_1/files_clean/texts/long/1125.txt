I am slightly reassured that the death toll in England appears to be reducing. I really want to return to work, but I don't think this will be for a good while yet due to the legal requirement for my establishment to temporarily close down. I am fearful that if lock down procedures continue for much longer then my establishment may be forced into making some employees redundant. I am worried that some people I know will catch the virus. I am concerned that NHS staff members are not receiving sufficient PPE to carry out their roles safely.
