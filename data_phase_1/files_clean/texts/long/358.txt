While I am physically at home I am quite content and feel safe enough. I am aware of potential threats from deliveries, post etc and become heightened with fear/anxiety while I have to deal with it.
I limit my time listening to the news and reports and social media about Covid 19so as not to feel overwhelmed or fearful. I do like to hear the briefing so that I can hear firsthand what is said instead of annoying spin from the media. I get irritated by the media pushing issues when they don't need to - it's irrisponsible.
