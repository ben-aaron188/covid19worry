I feel very anxious and scared about the whole corona situation at the moment. I am currently pregnant and very worried about the safety of me and my baby. I am worried for my loved ones and I am also very angry at everyone who is not adhering to the rules and continue to go out and not self isolating! I am angry that people don’t care about the safety of others and think it’s acceptable to continue doing things that they should not be doing. I hope and pray that this whole situation will disappear soon
