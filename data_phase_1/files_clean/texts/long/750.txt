I am terrified of this virus. My mother ended up in hospital and was tested twice, while they were negative, scan results suggest she had the virus prior to admission, and she was incredibly ill. I was afraid watching her being taken away in an ambulance would be the last time I saw her as she has a lung condition and so she is seriously high risk. People need to adhere to guidelines more. It is a terrifying situation. We are worried all of the time, afraid to go outside at all. I personally cannot take any risks as I live with and currently care for my mum.
