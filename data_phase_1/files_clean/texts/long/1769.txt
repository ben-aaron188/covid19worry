I'm anxious and concerned about the entire situation. Very sad regarding everyone who have lost people over the entire world.
Uncomfortable re whether or not the correct message is getting through to people.
Some other countries are facing a dire situation and I am concerned that inappropriate desitions may be made that may cost additional lives.
At home I worry for some of the elderly members of my family plus it is frustrating trying to get younger members to appreciate the full danger s of the situation.
