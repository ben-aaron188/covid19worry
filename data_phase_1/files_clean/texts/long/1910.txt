I am shocked more than anything that a % of society are showing arrogance in helping to eradicate the virus by doing as they please. I feel personally calm as I am abiding by all guidelines; however my frustration comes into play due to the fact that I am a self-employed individual who has now lost all income. Seeing people not listening to government advice is not helping the country get back to a reasonable state of normality. We need businesses to trade and the economy to start moving again. It's a worrying time for all businesses regardless of size.
