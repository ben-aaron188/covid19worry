A bit bored. Fed up. Anxious about who it will affect and how. I'm just waiting for it all to he over. I live in a rural area but I have to work in the epicenter this week. Which makes me very worried considering what I have seen on the news with regards to peoples attitudes to Social distancing. 
I'm worried about my nan who has had lung issues recently and lives in social housing. 
I'm hyper aware of everything my body is doing right now. And it's just annoying. Every cough I analysis. Every ache. Every sneeze. I feel like I can't cough or sneeze in public.
