I feel anxious and worried about my family and friends. I worry about all the people I know and love who work for the NHS. I am scared of leaving the house, scared for my own health. I don't enjoy going to the shops at the moment as it feels really scary and like people don't respect the distancing, they all come too close and I get scared. 

I have been ill and was worried the entire time that I wasn't going to get better. My chest was painful and it was scary not knowingwhat would make me feel any better.

I am angry and frustrated by being stuck at home. I keep arguing with my wife
