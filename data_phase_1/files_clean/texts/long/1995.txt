I feel concerned about the lack of knowledge and unknown about the virus. I worry that someone I know might get very poorly and I’m stressed out with my job as a key worker. I’m worried that my daughter is still attending school due to my job. I’m also worried about the financial impacts that this could have on my work, as well as my family and friends. Particularly those that are self employed. my stress levels have reduced in the last week compared to how they were previously. I’m enjoying spending time indoors with my family but it is hard to explain the current situation to my 5 year old & she keeps asking me when the virus is going to go away. I’m disappointed that my auntie who lives in Norway hasn’t been able to come visit but most importantly I want everyone to stay safe.
