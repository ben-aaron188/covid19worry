My feelings of anxiety grow each day. I do not enjoy the thought of contracting COVID-19 but I respect the government's advice to implement a lockdown. I am angry at those who flount the rules and I dispair at those who are panic buying, resulting in less food for those who genuinely need it
It will take some time for things to return to normal, and I don't like how long I think it will take
I have hope that as the world works together to combat COVID-19, we can come together to eliminate other diseases. 
I fear for the American people, who do not have free healthcare & have to decide what is more important, health or work
