I feel sad for all the families that have been affected by the coronavirus and the prospect that if I or someone close to me is hospitalised will be by herself and die alone. I am angry the government didn't do more earlier. I am sad about all the people that are affected financially by losing their jobs, I am sad for all the kids that don't understand why cannot meet their friends and cannot go to the playground. I fear that I will not be able to get another online order, i will have to go to the supermarket to buy food and I may get the coronavirus.
