It's a very anxious time as the financial situation is incredibly hard at the moment, not knowing when you will next get paid and be able to pay your bills. Not knowing whether you are being furloughed or whether you are getting made redundant. Everything is up in the air at the moment. Apart from this it's the fact of not being able to see family and friends and going out to town to have a few drinks with friends. Can't wait for everything to be lifted including the restrictions however I think these will be ongoing for the next 3-6 months which will cause huge amounts of issues.
