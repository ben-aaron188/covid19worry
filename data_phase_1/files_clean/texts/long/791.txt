Worried about older relatives, but really enjoying the en-mass complete break from normal life for everyone.

More relaxed than I've been for a while as my company aren't planning on furloughing any staff, my work load has gone down and I'm getting to spend a lot more time with my dog.

Getting supplies might become a worry if I run out of anything, however that hasn't happened and the stores all seem to have stock in them.

I'm enjoying being able to take care of a few projects I have around the home that have required finishing off.

Overall I haven't been hugely inconvenienced, and haven't directly suffered much because or Covid-19.
