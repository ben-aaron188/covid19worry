Unsure as to what may happen over the next few weeks. 
Worried about family and friends and have the added anxiety from being asthmatic.
Feeling not enough is being done to prevent the spread, too many people still outside at all times walking around as if there isn't a pandemic.
I think that government really needs to step up and take action as there is not enough care being provided for the elderly and homeless.
I'm glad that people have finally stopped hoarding bread and toilet paper and that I can actually make a full meal for the first time in weeks.
