As of 06/04/20, my overwhelming feeling is one of disgust. I am disgusted that thousands of members of the public are ignoring the governments guidelines about staying at home. It is NOT hard to stay at home, what IS hard is me volunteering in hospitals as a second year medical student and watching the wards collapsing under the pressure. It makes me ashamed to be a part of this nation. Italy, Spain and China are all under lockdown and are doing it correctly, so why are the people of Britain so selfish? It is appalling and shocking and as a member of the NHS, I am ashamed,
