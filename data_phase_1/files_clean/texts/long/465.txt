This is a very concerning time for many. It is unsettling to not be able to freely leave my house and visit my family and friends. However, whilst the corona virus in itself is scary and frightening for many, I am also enjoying spending time at home as well as working from home without the pressures of being in an environment with colleagues. I am concerned about the lack of food supply available and the health and safety of my family. I have anxiety about the situation, but my main concern with that is returning to work in an office environment. I am very content working from home and feel very lucky to be able to do so. The government should be doing further tests, particularly to NHS staff, to ensure they are fit and able to continue looking after themselves and those in the hospitals which they are caring for.
