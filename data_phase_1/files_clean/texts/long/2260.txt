I am worried about family and friends being affected. I am worried about the prime minister who has now gone to ICU. I am worried about the security of my job and ability to pay my bills. Overall the whole situation is worrying and scary but I am hopeful that we will see an end to it looking at the way other countries are going. I am also a little bored and fed up with having to be at home all the time as I am now working from home and concerned about my children's future and education. This is the scariest situation I have lived through and I find myself following the news constantly and looking and analysing the figures from arouns the world
