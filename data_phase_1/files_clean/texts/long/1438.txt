Main feeling is of being trapped, my girlfriend lives abroad in Egypt and cannot see her so is stressful, have no idea when i will see her next. Also worried about older relatives but for myself i am low risk so unlikely to be badly effected if i get corona. I also am worried about my job options as have just got back from travelling and currently am unemployed, recruiters have said there will be next to nothing in my field of work until after the lock down ends so am stuck unemployed at my parents until this.
