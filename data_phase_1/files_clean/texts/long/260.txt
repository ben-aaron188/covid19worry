I feel incredibly sad that so many people are dying with this horrible virus. It seems to be a real genetic lottery at the moment and it all depends on your genes to see if you survive or not. 
I am also angry at the government for not investing in the NHS which they are now relying on heavily to pull everyone through. 
I also feel anxiety for the people currently suffering and for my family. If the age at which people die from the virus now no longer just limited to older generations, then it stresses me out that anyone close to me can die.
