I am fortunate that I can work from home but I do still worry about the long term affects that it may have on our business and in turn my and my colleagues jobs. More than that though I am concerned about the health if my family and those most vulnerable in society. I hope that there is an end in sight at some point, even if it is many months away. Things like antibody tests will help, and personally I would be very keen to be tested to find out if I have had the virus and whether I am part of heard immunity.
