I feel anxious that I may get it and sad for those who have died. I feel stressed every time I need to go to the supermarket because everything feels unclean and I'm worried that the people around me may have it. I am also anxious about my future plans to emigrate which have been put on hold for the foreseeable future. After ten years of being stuck financially and in many other ways, I am finally unstuck, then this happened. I am trying my best to make my life go on as normal as much as possible in these strange times because I refuse to let the fear and negativity consume me
