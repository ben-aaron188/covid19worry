I feel concerned and a lot of stressful thoughts go through my head like how i’m going to pay my bills and how I might have to resign from my job because i’ve had to move out of my student accommodation and stay at my boyfriends house which is 2 hours away from my work place. Stress from deadlines and exams are also very prevalent. My brother is showing mild symptoms of Covid so that just adds more stress. I miss my friends so much and i don’t know when i’m going to see them again because i doubt they will return to London after the lockdown is over. My boyfriend helps me through the stress and it’s the first time we’re staying with each other and it’s quite fun but i get bored sometimes.
