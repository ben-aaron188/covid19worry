I am worried about my family members which are older. My dad is nearly 70 with no underlying health conditions but still goes to work.  I am frustrated as I want it to end and I want to get on with my life. I am anxious that they won't find a vaccine soon. I am sad I missed the last semester of university. I hope we will not be in isolation for too long now! However, watching the news does not give me hope that things will not get better soon. A positive from this is that communities are working together and I am feeling closer to my friends. I am irritated by the people near my house who keep having their friends round and seeing people going to the park on the TV.
