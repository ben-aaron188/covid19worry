At the moment I feel pretty relaxed about the issue.  I do not feel at risk myself as I have been home working for the past three weeks. All my family work from home if possible or limit themselves as best they can if they can not.

At the same time, I see posts on social media about people outside, in group gatherings enjoying the somewhat nice weather we have. This angers me because they do not care about potentially infecting someone who may not be able to fight off the virus. We have a bank holiday at the end of this week and the start of next, so a 4 day weekend and I wonder how many people will venture out. Even more so as we have been advised for over 2 weeks now to stay inside, I think some people will start losing the will to comply with the governmnents instructions which will result in more deaths
