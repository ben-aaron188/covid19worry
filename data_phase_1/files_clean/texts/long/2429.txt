I feel anxious about the future and I also feel a bit helpless to do anything about it. I feel annoyed to that people didnt think anything like this could happen to them and didnt listen to me when I warned them the good times have gone on too long. I think its worrying how ill prepared people are financially but also in having skills to cope with the bad times. I am taking this time to learn new things such as baking and gardening as I dont think tbis will be over quickly at all, this could go on for years and so we need to all become more self sufficient in order to cope and rely less on a globalised world.
