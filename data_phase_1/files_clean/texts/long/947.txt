I live in the UK, and it angers and upsets me that some people are still not listening to the rules of the lockdown, because key workers and people that work for the nhs are literally risking their lives to help save as many lives possible. I miss my friends and my grandparents who I haven’t seen since the Christmas period. My exams at University have been cancelled and there’s still an uncertainty of how my work is going to be graded as a lot of my work is purely based on coursework (fine art degree). I’m worried about my friends and family who are key workers and my grandparents who are over 70 and have health conditions. I hope scientists and doctors find a treatment soon and have the facilities to mass produce the vaccine as soon as possible.
