I am slightly concerned about the amount of deaths that are due to follow in the coming weeks due to reaching peak infections. I am also slightly worried about the amount of time that life will be this way, however I am comforted in the knowledge that a vaccine will be developed and COVID-19 will be controlled. I am disappointed that life has essentially been put on hold and opportunities are no longer available as they were prior to the pandemic. A big concern for be if the fact that the older generation are not seeming to be taking this outbreak as seriously as they should be. The older generation within my family particularly, are treating this as an other ""cold"" and do not seem to grasp the severity of the situation.
