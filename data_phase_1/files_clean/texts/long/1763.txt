I feel everyone in my country knows what they should be doing to stop the spread and death in this country so if we keep doing that, as most of my friends and relatives are as far as I am aware, then we will be over this in a few months. 

I also feel happy that I get to spend time at home learning my skills.

I am still slightly anxious in case I get it as it can be very serious, and my partner works out of the house 5 days a week in a hospital, so that is slightly worrying.

Overall I feel positive though.
