Concerned for the health of others in general and more specifically my close family and friends. Concerned for vulnerable members of society and people who may be feeling lonely and helpless during this time. Concerned about my financial health short term and long term due to the impacts on the economy, a widespread recession seems inevitable. Concerned about long term impacts of the coronavirus even after the worst has past such as restrictions and major changes to daily life. Grateful for key workers, specifically NHS staff for bravely battling on to support others, they deserve endless praise.
