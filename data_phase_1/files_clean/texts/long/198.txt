I'm largely worried about the situation getting worse.  I'm worried about my mental health. I'm worried about my financial stability over the next few months.  

I'm missing the people close to me like my mother and my boyfriend.  I miss my daily routines which involved going outside such as the gym and my regular shop.

I'm wondering how and when things will improve.  I'm also put off by others trying to use the situation to hurt others, like people stockpiling valuable resources or selling them for a profit to more vulnerable people.

I'm wondering how small to large businesses and the economy in general will look after it is all over.  There are many wineries near me and it would be a shame if they did not open their doors again.
