The uncertainty regarding the local community impact of the virus and the duration of the lockdown cause me moderate anxiety. I have returned to work in the local hospital during the pandemic, so I have a change of routine to adjust to at this time as well. We have childcare to organise and we are finding solutions to allow my partner and I to work. I am concerned at the unpredictable nature of coronavirus infection. I am worried about my family getting ill. I am happy that the shops have plenty of food and that there are no issues with groceries and fuel at the moment.
