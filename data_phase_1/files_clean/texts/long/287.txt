I am really concerned that someone in my close family (particulalry my elderly parents and parents in law and my young children) will be impacted significantly by the coronavirus.  I'm equally worried about the economic impact a lockdown will have and the impact that may have upon my job security - should I lose my job then I would have significant difficulty meeting financial obligations.  I feel sad that, as a community, we have been diustanced from each other - though there are some positives in the fact people have found alternative ways to communicate despite this.
