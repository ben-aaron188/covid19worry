I feel sad and lonely to be honest. Everything within my life has changed; I’m adapting to working from home which isn’t easy - I miss the little things like laughing with colleagues on a daily basis or simply being able to walk to and from work everyday. When it gets to the weekend the prospect of not being able to do anything is upsetting. I’ve wanted to try and do something productive during my down time but can’t draw myself to motivate myself to do anything effective. This makes me feel worse even still and fees like I’m wasting some of the time to an extent.
