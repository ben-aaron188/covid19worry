I feel sad about the amount of people who have lost loved ones. I am fearful of a time I might know someone who has been seriously ill or dies. I am worried for my parents and older relatives. I feel scared about what could happen if the infection does not slow down, or if it mutates. In terms of the lockdown on a personal level, I am very relaxed in my personal situation and enjoying the opportunity to take a break from normal life, spend more time and work from home. It has given me a lot more clarity and clear thinking on life and has been very welcome. I enjoy stepping out of consumerism and living a more simple life.
