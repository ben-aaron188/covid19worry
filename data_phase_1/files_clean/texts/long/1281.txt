At the moment my anxiety of the uncertain is causing my mental health anxiety and depression to flair up quite badly. The fact that people on the frontline are working with very little PPE is worrying for their lives and also disgusting when it comes to the underfunding of the NHS which has caused the lack of preparations for this pandemic which we could see was coming a mile off. I am thankful for community and friends pulling together to help one another out and make it as painless as possible, but I am angry that the politicians did not take earlier steps to shut down the country before it grew to the level it is now at.
