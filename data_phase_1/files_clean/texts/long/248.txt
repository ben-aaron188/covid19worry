I'm a nurse caring for elderly patients who not for ITU admission or other medical escalation. I feel terribly sad for them and their families. And I feel scared that I'll catch it and give it to my husband. I'm angry at the lower standard of care being given to my patients. My ward is currently not overwhelmed but we are all anxiously awaiting an imminent influx of patients. This anxiety is exhausting. There isn't a good atmosphere on my ward at work. I also feel worried about Boris Johnson. I don't think he can be very well at all if he is still in hospital.
