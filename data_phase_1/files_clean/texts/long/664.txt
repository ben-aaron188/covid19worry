I believe not everyone is pulling their wait in social distancing. If you look at how Germany and S Korea have handled it they have an extremely low mortality rate. Their citizens have followed the rules and they are gonna come out of this situation sooner than other countries.

I think people are not told enough information. I work in a supermarket and the amount of people who come in wearing gloves is unbelievable, surely people need to learn that they are not protecting others and are just spreading the virus more. Washing your hands is the best way to keep us all safe.
