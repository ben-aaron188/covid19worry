I’m quite relaxed about the situation. I work from home and my  immediate family is also working from home. The risk of catching it is low. The only place we can catch is it at the supermarket and we only go very rarely late in the evening. I try to avoid watching the news and try to stick to once per day- this helps me manage anxiety and unnecessary stress. I feel optimistic about the future. I think we will get through it as a country. I’m not worried about my elderly relatives because they are self-isolating. We only drop food off outside for their house and don’t go indoors.
