I don't really know how to feel about it at first i didn't think much of it but as its going on and with Boris Johnson being put in intensive care its getting more worrying. i've been keeping inside for around 2-3 weeks now and don't think we'll be out anytime soon although deaths have dropped over the weekend here in the united kingdom.

I've been wondering how South Korea have managed the virus so well because they have extremely low deaths and cases and also have had no lockdown.

Even the experts all say contradicting things when reading up on Coronavirus and no country was really prepared to deal with it so nobody knows how we even begin to come out of this situation.
