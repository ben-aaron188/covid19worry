I'm angry with the Government for many reasons over their handling of this crisis - from the 'herd immunity' scandal to lying about numbers of tests being done, to putting ideology (Brexit) before co-operation with the EU over supplies etc. Also for ignoring offers from ventilator manufacturers already set up in this country rather than their mate Dyson (over-designed, expensive no doubt). I am angry that they have starved the NHS of money for years, demeaned ""low-skill employees"" etc and these are the people currently keeping this country functioning (cleaners, drivers, porters, carers etc). 
I am very anxious about dying, and the financial/economic disaster facing this country/the world. I have 2 children (teen/young adult) and I worry about their future prospects. I am a key worker and putting my life at risk for my clients (shopping and cleaning in their homes).
