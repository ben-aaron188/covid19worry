I am worried about the world that we are going to come back out to. I might not have a job, businesses are going to struggle for years following this economic downturn.

If I lose my job and can't get another one quick enough I am going to lose my flat which is very stressful.

I am fed up of being stuck inside. I am living with my parents again and losing my independence is very difficult. 

I miss my friends and my freedom. 

It is very hard on my mental health. I am getting wound up very easily and people are losing their temper.
