I feel very sad for the people who have lost their lives to this virus, I also feel anger towards Westminster government,if they had acted quicker then lots of people would still be alive today, also Iâ€™m disgusted at Westminster for not helping the nhs more by helping them to have the right PPE to help protect them against this virus. Westminster government should be held to account when this is all over.england should also go on full lock down as they are not following the rules and they are spreading the virus more by not listening which makes me soo angry.
