Very worried, I work at hospital and worried about bringing it home to my husband and children. I frightened of what I may see on the wards as it’s so unknown to me. I am so worried about who I may lose in all this and already know friends family members who have passed away. I’m annoyed at people not social distancing out in public and their ignorance to this extremely contagious virus. I can’t believe people are still socially engaged and mixing in public. I feel they need to make stricter rules so we protect our wonderful NHS
