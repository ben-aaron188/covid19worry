I feel some anxiety about how things will develop in the country and in case a member of my family or someone I know contracts it and becomes seriously ill as a result (although I feel this is fairly unlikely). I also feel hopeful that the situation will “level off” and begin to improve. I am limiting my exposure to news reports and only checking this a couple of times a day in order to limit anxiety. I am finding the “lockdown” quite frustrating although also feel fortunate to have easy access to safe outdoor space, I’m aware that not everyone does. I am trying to help elderly neighbours with shopping.
