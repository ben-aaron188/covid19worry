The situation is causing me great stress as people aren't following the government's advice. If people stayed home, it would be much more contained and could reduce the spread. My whole family work for the NHS so we're a full key-worker household, which adds to the stress, since we are putting our lives at risk and others are just being plain ignorant to benefit themselves. Thus, I'm quite anxious that things may get worse; people need to follow the rules, and if that means a FULL lockdown, then so be it. We need to be safe.
