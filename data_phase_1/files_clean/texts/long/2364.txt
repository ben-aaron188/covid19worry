At the moment i am a bit worried for my family and friends. I feel a bit sorry for my children who have had their normal freedom and routine messed about. I also feel very hopeful that as long as we all do our part then we can get through this till a time a vaccine can be made to protect or find a drug to help heal the worse affected people. I feel across the world a lot of countries are started to turn the tide on this virus which does make me hopeful we can do the basics to get this under control. I do also feel very lucky to live in a country with.a good health system as well which can open a new hospital in 9 days and have all the bits we need to try and help save people.
