I find myself feeling quite short tempered and anxious. I feel that ""life is on hold"" at the moment, and there is nothing I can do about it.
I feel upset that I have had to cancel my holiday in May, and frustrated not knowing when life will return to some sort of normality.
I would like to be able to see my granddaughter, and to help my son and his partner move house, but I don't think I will be able to.
It is very frustrating. I have re-booked my holiday for next April, I hope I will be able to go then. I also hope that I will be able to go to visit my Son, his partner and my granddaughter in their new home in Devon.
