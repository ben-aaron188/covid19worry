It’s an anxious time. People aren’t listening to advice which will make it worse for everyone. This makes me sad as we this is a great time to prove to everyone what a great country we are. I’m scared for the future, not about my own health, but the health of those around me. However, I feel this is driven a lot by the media - daily messages about the number of deaths etc. Really brings it all home. It also makes me anxious that I still have to go to work in hospitality to be a security guard for the building. It worries me that a pandemic doesn’t even keep you safe.
