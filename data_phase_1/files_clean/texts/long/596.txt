I don't know how to feel. I'm not sure I even believe it. Is it fake? Is something bigger happening? Is it simply a trial for the 'real' thing?

Because of the above feelings I haven't taken any steps to avoid contracting the Corona virus. If it is real, I believe many of us have already caught it but the symptoms have been so little we didn't even realise. My job requires I still interact with the public.

There are a lot of strange happenings around the Corona virus that the media doesn't report on. There is a lot happening during the Corona virus that the media simply ignores. This is what gets my tin foil hit twitching.
