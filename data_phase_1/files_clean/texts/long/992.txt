I am very scared and worried for members of my family. I am also very concerned about the future. I am having great difficulty in sleeping and I am also very worried about my mental health. I am not working at the moment and I am worried about where my next meal will come from. My mortgage will still need paying and I do not know where I will get the funds from.

My in laws are both in their 70s and do not social isolate. I am very concerned about both their physical and mental health. They do not stay in even though the guidelines state that they should for their own safety.
