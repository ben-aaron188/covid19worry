I know that it is very serious and I am moderately concerned for the future as it is so unknown. However, I do believe that we will recover as a society. So, although I am very sad for those who have lost their lives and list loved ones, I am not fearful for the future. I do not worry for myself as I am healthy and my job is unaffected by the current situation as I can work from home. I suppose one of my major concerns is the effect it's having on my wife as she is started to feel distressed and anxious about the situation, and as she is quite extroverted is beginning to struggle with being stuck in the house.
