At this moment I am especially anxious about the situation as it develops, with more and more deaths being recorded each day. As well as this, despite strict 'lockdown' instructions being issued in the UK, many people still see the nicer weather as an opportunity to flout these instructions, not only putting themselves at risk but others as well. This disappoints and worries me, as I have an elderly grandma who if she were to catch the virus, I fear she would not survive. I myself am young and of good health, so my concern is not for my own health, but those around me.
