Tired and overwhelmed - rationally I know that this is a trauma response and that it should ease over time, but that doesn't clear the fog of tiredness and feeling overwhelmed. I am lucky - and aware of that privilege - that I can, and am, working remotely, but I am ill at ease with it and feel like I am not being productive enough. My employer has made it clear that they don't expect full productivity but that is hard to keep in mind in the moment. 

I am worried about my father, who lives overseas, and what I would/would not be able to do should anything happen to him.
