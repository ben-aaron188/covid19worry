Before taking part in this survey, I wasn't even thinking about the corona virus today. Once I began thinking about it, I started to feel a bit agitated and anxious - when will this end? Will I get my summer holiday abroad? Will Boris ban outdoor exercise, because stupid people do picnics in the middle of a pandemic? I am really angry at those people, because they do not respect the others, who follow the rules. Because of them, the whole society might get punished, even though most people are staying at home and not gathering outside. I also really miss my friends and my boyfriend, whom I haven't seen in two-three weeks. It's boring without him and every day just drags on. At least I have my dog, so I am never *too* bored.
