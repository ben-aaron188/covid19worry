Expanding on the previous questions, I am angry that some people do not believe this pandemic is serious. At present, our PM (who in early March boasted of shaking hands with lots of people, presumably because he's 'ard) is now in hospital, potentially on a ventilator. Lots of people are going out in droves and not observing social distancing rules, because they're very non-chalant about it.
Meanwhile, my partner is immuno-supressed and very worried about everything, my company is on the verge of failing, and it's impossible to do any shopping because everyone is panic-buying stuff that they're likely going to chuck away very soon anyway. On the plus side, I'm getting more time to exercise and more time to catch up on some xbox games I haven't played for years.
