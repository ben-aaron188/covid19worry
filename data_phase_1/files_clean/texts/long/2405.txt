I feel extremely anxious about the situation and when it will end. I am worried about my elderly parents getting sick. I am worried I might stop getting paid the longer the situation lasts. I was in the middle of buying a house before lockdown and now I have no idea what will happen with that. It makes me worry about where my life is heading. I’m not in control of it now and it’s future is being changed because of a virus. I worry about the front line workers getting sick when they have no choice but to do their jobs; I have several friends who are medics. I am grateful for all the work they and other emergency workers are doing right now to help us all.
