I feel as though something awful may be on the horizon and that I will have no idea it is coming until it begins to happen. It feels as though we are all teetering on the edge of something bad, and I fear that everyone will start to panic in a way even more detrimental than the virus itself. I'm worried about those I care about getting ill and not being able to do anything about it, and it feels as though the problem isn't even real when you're not allowed to leave your house to see the extent of change that has happened outside.
