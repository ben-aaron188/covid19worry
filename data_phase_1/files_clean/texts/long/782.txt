I'm concerned about the effect it could have on my family and friends, apprehensive about the potential effects on the economy and sad that it has prevented me from seeing people.  It's also been very frustrating the way that many people have reacted, by either panic buying or ignoring the advice and continuing to mix with others.
However, I'm relieved that my job is (for the time being) safe, and that no-one I know has suffered any major effects.  The reduction in pollution has been a positive side effect, and it may result in some positive changes to the way we live and work (such as more remote working).
