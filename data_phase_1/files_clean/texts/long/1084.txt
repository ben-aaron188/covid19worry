I feel very worried about the future and what it may hold as there is so much uncertainty with health and work. I don’t sleep well now as the situation seems to change all the time and I don’t feel confident about the future both near and far. I feel other people don’t take it seriously and wish more people would just stay indoors I have stopped taking my daily walk out as there are too many people about and I constantly want to avoid them and not go near anyone.
Seeing the shop shelves starting to get back to normal has been a relief and has put my mind slightly at ease but our local shop still has lots of gaps on shelves.
