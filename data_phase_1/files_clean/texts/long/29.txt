Anxious about the behaviour of others.  I'm socially distancing myself and actually going back to work in a clinical role to support my colleagues, but there are lots of selfish people who are just not appearing to take the situation seriously or are taking advantage of the situation.  I'm fearful for my parents, in-laws and other relatives who have underlying health conditions / are vulnerable and aren't getting the support they need.  I am thankful that I had a relatively minor case of Covid-19 (I'm 90% it was Covid) and that it didn't affect me or my husband as badly as some people.  I'm also thankful that I have a supportive husband who is helping me to take my mind off of the anxiety that I'm feeling at the moment.
