I am very bored of being in my home a lot more than usual. I am not  able to socialise with people other than the family I live with, we are running out of forms of entertainment and are all starting to feel down. I personally get a lot of anxiety from being alone and I have been getting that a lot recently due to being in self isolation. I just want people to do the right thing and stay home for this to be over with as soon as possible, then the world can have a bit more normality back. It just isn't the best experience to be honest
