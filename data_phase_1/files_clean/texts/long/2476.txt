At present I feel slightly anxious and uncertain as to what the future will hold. I am also in some ways hopeful that the crisis we are in will have some positive influence on the future direction of our society. It may lead to a greener way of living, having highlighted the damage caused by unrestrained economic growth. Certainly many of us have time to reflect on our situation now; which can be good for society as a whole. It should also help everyone appreciate how much we depend on one another, and maybe act as a spur to greater equality.
