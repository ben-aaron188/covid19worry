I feel angry at the source of the outbreak and how it was hidden by the Chinese government for so long. However, I'm not angry at the Chinese people because I know it isn't their fault. I also find myself questioning whether other governments might have some kind of warped role to play in the scenario (e.g. 5G conspiracies and other theories).

I am not overly worried about my own health if I get the virus, but I am very worried about the potential for my parents to become ill.

I am self employed and I've lost a lot of work through the coronavirus. Although it's positive that the government will support self employed people, this help will not come until June and in the meantime I don't know how I will cope for money. I am a travel writer and I am now having to force myself to imagine a world without the concept of international travel. I am truly fearful that we might be restricted from travelling for years into the future. The uncertainty is what is getting to me the most.

I am getting so frustrated with the lockdown and how it has destroyed my business and left me feeling really lonely and anxious, depressed etc. Eventually, there will come a time when we have to leave our houses and I am beginning to wonder whether we will ever have this virus under control. Ultimately, at some point we will have to face the music, let nature run its course and accept the casualties. It's tough, but sometimes that's how life works out.
