Right now I've started getting used to life under lockdown, and I'm finding ways to keep myself busy. The first week was really bad for me mentally, but I think I'm used to the situation and have come to terms with it. I've also become able to accept that I have little to no control over what happens with the lockdown, other than staying inside, so right now I'm just waiting for things to develop.

I'm trying to give myself things to do, but the biggest problems for me are the lack of motivation and boredom. I'm trying to keep a routine but it's been a bit difficult sticking to it, and I'm having trouble sleeping. I also find that I'm eating more than normally, which I'm trying to fix this week, as well as drinking more.
