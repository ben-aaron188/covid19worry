It's easy to feel anxious about this situation so right now I am trying to relax and focus on other things. This survey is one such thing.  

I feel a little sad as well because the mother of someone I respect has just passed away from the virus.

I also feel lucky as I am not currently struggling financially and I know that many have little or no income.  

Anxiety is something I am keen to minimise, as a result, I have chosen not to follow developments too closely although I have made sure I am fully aware of all safety measures and our family took the decision to adopt social distancing and remain inside 10 days before the majority of people.
