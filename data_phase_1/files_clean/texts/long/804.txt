I am trying to take one day at a time and not think how long the situation will be like this. Otherwise I get very anxious. I have never suffered with anxiety before. Lots of deep breaths needed to calm me down. Not all the time but a sporadic feeling. I am working from home (always do wfh) but trying to supervise my children at the same time is tricky. Even though they are old enough to get on with things without me, they still need help or advice on school work, getting things done and just my company.
