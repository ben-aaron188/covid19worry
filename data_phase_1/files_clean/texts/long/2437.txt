My overwhelming emotion is anxiety about the health and well-being of my family, especially my parents (dad in particular, because of his disability and a lifetime of chain-smoking). I also dislike the feeling of my world getting even smaller than it already was. I still go to work, which I am grateful about, and then I go home. My best friend does all my grocery shopping for me because I fear becoming ill (she does as well, but to a lesser extent). The high-light of my day is our daily 5km walk around the canal and fields on the outskirts of the little town we live in. I know it is contrary to the advice, but we both need to walk off our anxiety for our mental health. There are no people where we walk, just friendly sheep, two horses, two llamas (seriously), lots of swans and ducks and birdsong. It is the only time during the day when I feel somewhat relaxed, and it helps with my insomnia. I really hope this situation improves before more lives are lost and the economy deteriorates beyond repair. Many people around me are anxious and angry; a few are angry about being forced into non-essential work with social distancing that looks good in front of an inspection, but does nothing to actually protect people from contracting the virus.
