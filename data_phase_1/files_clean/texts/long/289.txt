I am very worried about the high cases and deaths all around the world. I do not feel as if the governments around the world are doing everything possible to stop the spread of the virus and trying to find a cure for the virus. Hoping this will all end soon and everyones lives can go back to routine. This year I had planned to go on many trips but feel very sad that most of them will not happen. I feel as if many people are not taking this pandemic seriously and are continuing to go outside for unnecessary reasons and do not apply social distancing. if they continue to do this it will take longer to flatten the curve.
