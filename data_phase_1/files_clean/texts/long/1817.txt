I feel that the corona virus is scary because it has taken many lives and also negative,y impacted businesses. It means that I can’t have a social life and not see my friends in person as places of social recreation are all closed and I can’t go about doing my daily hobbies and tasks. It also feels weird as the city feels unnaturally quiet and docile, because everything is being stripped back to the bear minimum. Finally I feel it’s also effecting people’s finances as there are mass job losses. But having said all that I feel that there is a silver lining because people are somewhat saving in a way and also the fact that low paid work is seen as the backbone of societal progress and continuity
