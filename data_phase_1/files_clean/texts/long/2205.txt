I am anxious about the situation. The fear of the unknown is what is causing it the most. I am worried for my family, friends and colleagues safety. Although I understand social distancing is so important, it makes me sad I can't see loved ones. People not abiding by social distancing and ignoring rules are ignorant and selfish, we need to work together to ensure we put the best fight out there. To protect the population and the NHS. I think the UK are working as hard as they can to try and reduce the number of deaths but everyone needs to play their own part.
