Upset that world I know will change a lot. I am worried very much about work situation in my family, we hope that no one will lose jobs, otherwise financial burdens will press extremely. We are probably more worried about finances than health, although we know how dangerous virus can be. I am working fro home for last year, for the time being until danger of virus will fade my wife started working from home as well, therefore  social distancing it's not an issue for us. I see a lot of people finding an issue of coming back to normal life in the future. There will be new ""norm"", but world will never be the same
