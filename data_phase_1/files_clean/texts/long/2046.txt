I feel really worried as each day the number of deaths are high, i have been at home for the past 2 weeks and this has caused my mood to be low as i have struggled from being very socialable to very reserved. I feel sad when i hear about the deaths and how they are affecting not only others but close friends too, im missing my family and friends and feel very unsure about the future and when this will end. I do feel greatful to be at home and feel safe at home, i feel admiration for all the health workers who are very brave.
