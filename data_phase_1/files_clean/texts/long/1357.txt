With the virus it has both become a limiter and has changed the lives of I and many others. Since lock down I personally have left the house once, and I cannot see any of my family as they are vulnerable with grandparents who have severe lung issues, two pregnant sisters and so much more.

It's both nice to not feel obliged to go out and socialise, but it's scary in the fact we do not know what will happen. How will our lives be after this pandemic and will it be a normal thing in a few years, we don't know. Most the time we sit and watch other countries under pressure, we've never really experienced being the country that is under pressure. From this we've now seen how unstable and inconsiderate our government is to help us instead they care more for public appearance, which put me and many other students at risk because they left it all open.
