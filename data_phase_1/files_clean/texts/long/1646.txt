Annoyed that a complete lock down wasn't issued 2 weeks ago, but understand the financial impacts on the country by doing so. I currently work in the construction industry and understand the impact of a complete lock down, but I feel this was the only option to prevent further spread. Too many people are still ignoring social distancing rules. The lack of testing currently being undertaken is also a massive worry - The current figures reported seem extremely unreliable. I do feel it's going to get a lot worse than people realise, and the chances of a recession are completely realistic.
