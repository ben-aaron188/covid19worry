I feel very anxious about the current situation. I feel it's like a 'waiting game' and the uncertainty makes things very difficult to face. The fact we don't know what the outcome is is very unsettling. No one is sure when this will be over and life will return to normal. I feel scared, worried, anxious and frightened but at the same time life has slowed down and I'm becoming adjusted to the 'new normal' and my wellbeing has most certainly improved what with getting more sleep and not having to commute for 3 hours a day I am seeing at least one benefit from this awful situation.
