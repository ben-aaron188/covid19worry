I feel that we've been caught with our pants down. There were warnings. We knew what was happening in China. yes, their government played it down, but our own intelligence services operate in that country (I'm sure). Where were they?
We also didn't lockdown as soon as the crisis in Italy became apparent. Too slow to react. 
I know we try to police by consent and the government doesn't want what the police do today to have long term negative impact on relations with the public, but when people are openly flouting the lockdown we need to make an example of them. They're putting people's lives at risk.
