At this moment, I am feeling incredibly bored by the whole ever-evolving Coronavirus situation. I live alone so have had to self-isolate by myself in a small studio flat and it is a lonely and experience. I miss human contact. The unknown unknown of when we will actually get to experience normal life again also makes me very angry about the Corona situation. I am also anxious about the wider global context of Coronavirus and the last effects it might have on me, my friends and family, and those around me.
