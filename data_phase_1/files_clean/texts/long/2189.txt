I'm worried for the health of my children, my wife and myself. Im worried for my extended family and friends. Im worried people i know and care for will die. Im worried lots of my family and friends wont have jobs to go back to once the crisis is over. Im worried about the long term effect on the economy and my community. I dont think life will return to normal for many years. I fear for the stability of the peace process in northern ireland ss we have only recently started to properly move forward.
