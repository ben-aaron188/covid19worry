I feel anxious based largely on the fact that I am powerless to control the situation at hand. Short of making sure I don't get sick I can't do anything to secure myself. I have no control over market forces or actions by the government. Sometimes I awake in the middle of the night s a result of bad dreams relating to the current crisis. I am nervous about job security also as I have a mortgage and myself and my partner are in the same field. I also feel unenthusiastic about hobbies I used to do to keep occupied which is frustrating as now should be an opportunity to do them but find less enjoyment in them than before.
