I think all happening around the coronavirus is very exaggerated. Information is normally given without any reference so that it is not possible to evaluate the numbers. Too much pressure is done to make people afraid of something, to stay at home and close businesses. All media tell only horrors about the situation instead of sharing improvements. It is clear that it is easier to manage mass when they are scared. Overall I think that this is an artificial virus created by a human being to win an economic war on the planet.
