I feel anxious about the current situation because of the uncertainty and how much it has affected our daily lives so far, and we do not know how long it is going to go on for. It is worrying hearing about the current infection rate and the increase in deaths per day. I am also angry at all the people that are completely ignoring the requirements for us to socially distance ourselves from relatives and friends. 
I feel worried about the lack of robust information about Covid-19, for example the lack of information on how to 'treat' the virus and fear that way more people are actually infected than the official figures show.
