I feel right now that the situation cannot be helped, and all we can do is try our best as a community to prevent it from getting worse. I'm encouraged by how people have been coming together and supporting vulnerable people, but disheartened by people who seem to treat this as some sort of holiday and won't stay at home.

On a personal level my employment and income has been effected, and I haven't seen my family in months, which is worrisome. I do not have children so I have no need to worry about them, but I am deeply concerned I may not have a job in 3 months time if things continue, which would be disastrous for me on a personal and professional level.
