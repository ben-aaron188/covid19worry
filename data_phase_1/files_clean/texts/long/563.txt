I am frustrated and angered by handling of situation by UK government. The Tories have shown themselves to be both incompetent and inadequate in the current crisis. 

I am worried about my children, their future and their prospects. 

I am worried about the risk ""essential workers"" are putting themselves in. I feel they are being put under unnecessary risk. 

I am discusted by Boris Johnson and most of the conservative party. 

I am hopefully the new labour leader and shadow cabinet can have a positive effect on the current situation.
