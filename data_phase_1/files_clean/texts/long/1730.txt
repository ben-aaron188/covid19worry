I find this time very worrying as it is the unknown. I worry about my grandparents due to their age and general health, but more so my husband who works for the NHS. He is within the estates department between two hospitals and has had a massive amount of pressure recent weeks planning for the resources for people which has left him very run down and tired. I worry about him getting corona and the fact he is tired. Even though we Are told it is mainly the elderly it is fatal there has still been a large number of cases of deaths amongst the younger population. I am frustrated as I cannot see my relatives I am missing just being able to pop over for a quick coffee of a chat, things which previously I took for granted and I assume the general population did too!
