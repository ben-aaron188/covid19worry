Concerned for my partner who is pregnant and type 1 diabetic. Hoping the situation improves quickly before we are due to give birth. At the moment I will not be able to join my partner in theatre if it is required which would be very upsetting to miss the birth of my first child which is meant to be a magical moment with skin to skin. I also fear for my job, which has been thurlowed for now but I worry if it lasts much longer if it will
Mean I lose my job and I worry about having enough income to support my new family.
