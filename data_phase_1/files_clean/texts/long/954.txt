I’m a Keyworker and am extremely anxious about leaving the house especially to go to work. I worry about passing something back to my family, especially my son. If I’m not at work I stay at home all of the time as my anxiety around corona virus is sky high. I also feel very frustrated that some people aren’t following g the governments guidelines regarding staying at home and social distancing as the sooner we all do this the sooner things will be normal again, although I still don’t expect normal for many many months
