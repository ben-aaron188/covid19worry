I'm worried about what the Coronavirus could turn in to in the next few weeks, and how the deaths and confirmed cases are escalating rapidly in the UK. There isn't any signs of the spread and death rate slowing at the moment, and with both my parents over 60 with underlying health conditions, I worry about them greatly. Their risk factor is very high. I'm not too worried about myself at the moment, as my risk factor is low due to my age. I'm enjoying not doing anything and being at home all day as it allows me to get on with my hobbies which I wouldn't usually have time for.
