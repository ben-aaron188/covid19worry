I'm feeling anxious about my family's health, especially my older relatives who will be more at risk to this virus. As well as how this will affect my Alevel grades and if I will be able to go to my first choice university. I'm feeling sad that I'm unable to see my family, who don't live in the same household, as well as my friends. In addition, I am also sad about not being able to take my Alevels or have a final celebration of finishing Year 13. Finally, I'm almost disgusted by the people who still aren't taking the guidelines set by the government seriously.
