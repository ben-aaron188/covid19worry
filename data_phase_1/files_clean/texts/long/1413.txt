Worried that some people still arenâ€™t taking lock down seriously (by still visiting friends and family or meeting at gatherings or spending time in the sun at tourist spots) which could have huge consequences with the Coronavirus cases continuing to rise. Angry whenever I see this is the case, but happy when I see people abiding by the rules or when I go on a walk and smile at someone from across the road, a safe distance away. I am Also anxious at the rate that ventilators etc are running out, so trying not to spend too long watching/reading the news each day. Scared for the safety of everyone but hopeful at the efforts and creativity of a lot of people during this time!
