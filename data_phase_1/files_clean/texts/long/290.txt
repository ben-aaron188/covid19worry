The coronavirus situation is making me very worried, not so much for myself but more for those around me. I constantly live with the fear of losing someone close to me from this virus and it darkens my mind day by day. Total isolation also bares issues for my mental health. Extreme loneliness has me burrowing through my brain for entertainment leaving me with nothing but my worrying thoughts of the death of my loved ones to comfort me. These are very dark times that we live in. Daring to go out creates even more fear. Not only does the threat of the deadly virus warrant horrible concerns of loved ones in hospitals, the possibility of a fine or being arrested just for leaving your house is truly terrifying. Normally, the thought of prison is harsh enough. However, at this point the fine is worse, not only have many lost their jobs or at least suffered massive cuts to wages. Now the government is trying to take more money from us.
