I'm mostly despondent at how difficult it is to do anything particularly interesting or fun, though I have tried to work around it by seeing friends remotely. I feel fairly trapped inside the house, though I am making an effort to get regular exercise, as I'm working from here and can't go out very much at the weekends. I'm also concerned for people like my grandparents who are elderly, but more generally for the whole population as various people have died who aren't elderly or have other health issues.
