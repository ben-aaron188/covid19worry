Regarding the Coronavirus situation, I am feeling moderately anxious which seems to increase with the continued lockdown in the United Kingdom.

I feel that my anxiety is related to the impact the virus will have on society in general, the economy, my income and the health and livelihood of people around me, and in particular people who are more vulnerable.

I think that governments are starting to act more tactfully in combatting the virus and its wider effect on society and to communicate clearer messages and information to the public. However I strongly believe that the UK government did not respond efficiently to the virus' initial breakout.

At the same time I am feeling optimistic that the situation will improve relatively soon and that life should start to return to normal quicker than expected.
