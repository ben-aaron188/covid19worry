I feel very anxious almost every day when I discuss it with my friends or read the news. I feel quite miserable because so many plans were ruined and will be ruined for me and many other people.  I feel grief for those people who lost their close ones and my heart aches for all the struggles the doctors and nurses have to go through. I feel stressed despite trying to stay rational and do what is necessary. The lack of clarity relating to the virus and how it will affect personal lives, economy and other spheres of life causes a lot of discomfort. I feel uncertain about decisions I should make regarding my life right now. I have very little hope, but feel united with people around the world more than ever because the pandemic affected every single person in the world and not many things can do that.
