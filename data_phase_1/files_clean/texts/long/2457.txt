I feel anxious about the health of my friends, family and colleagues. Life has changed significantly and I so I am anxious about the change and loss of control over basic aspects. I am saddened by reports of death and the grieving experienced by families - it makes me feel sad to watch this on the news every day. What’s happening at the moment feels very unusual and at times I notice I am fearful. My sleep has been impacted and I think this is related to higher levels of anxiety. sometimes I feel angry and despair that the community aren’t all pulling together to protect the NHS. I feel disgusted seeing images of people not social distancing on news reports.
