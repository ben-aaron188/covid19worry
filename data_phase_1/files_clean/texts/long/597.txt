I feel scared that my family may become infected. I feel lonely and sad as I am unable to see my family and friends. I often feel anxious as the future is uncertain and i feel stressed that I cannot plan anything as I have no idea when this will end. Iâ€™m concerned about when I will be able to return to my normal life but also feel uncertain of what normal is now. I hope that soon things will be able to get back to normal as I miss many parts of my normal weekly life. Due to the government restrictions I am unable to have a social life, do my usual physical activity and attend school which has a had a huge impact on my mental health and it becoming worse every day. I often feel depressed at night and find myself overthinking a lot more than usual.
