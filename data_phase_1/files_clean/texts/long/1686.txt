I am worried about the coronavirus situation as it is scary and I am anxious about what could happen. It is scary how it all happened so quickly as it was not very well know over here but now it is everywhere and you canâ€™t get away from it. It has all happened really quickly over the past month or so and it is all you hear and read about on the news and radio and every program. I work at the hospital and I never know when I am going to be asked to not go in anymore as the situation is getting worse and worse and they are trying to find places where they can convert the buildings in to extra hospital buildings with beds for potential patients
