I feel anxious, restless and worried about my relatives. Annoyed at the world's governments for not acting sooner, and concerned for the effect it will have on my child. I enjoy staying at home, but feel frustrated at not easily obtaining groceries and that I can't spend time with my grandparents. I'm generally an optimist but feel that this problem will affect us for quite a long time, and long-term am extremely concerned that vulnerable relatives will contract the virus and die. I also feel despairing of people who are not taking the threat seriously.
