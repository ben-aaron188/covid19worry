I’m really bored. Every day feels exactly the same as the one before with little prospect of change in the medium term. I miss sport, pubs and the cinema and as I’m not getting any time to myself whatsoever my mental health is suffering. I’m finding little things irritating such as being told I have to write no fewer than five hundred characters. I can express how I feel perfectly well in less than five hundred characters to be honest; I don’t feel the need to write an essay on the subject. I think if you’re going to ask for something like this you should really make it explicit right from the outset.
