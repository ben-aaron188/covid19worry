I feel lonely and deflated. I miss people I love. I keep being amazed at how well I’m coping. And wonder every day if someone close to me will be taken by it. Life is odd. I feel like I’m in an odd movie and I’ll wake up to normal life tomorrow. I love home educating my children but feel we all miss out on so many experiences so we keep talking about what’s sad or scary. I’m tired all the time and I keep waking up. Now I’m wondering if boris will die. What happens then. I worry I might lose my husband, and then I imagine the day when we get out again what will it all be life. Will people be kind?
