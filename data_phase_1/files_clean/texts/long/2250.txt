I am concerned about the risk of the disease to my family and my parents and inlaws.  It feels quite away from us and that we are safe but I worry we won't be.  I am enjoying running most days. I am concerned for businesses as some most be going bust.  I am worried about my holidays in the summer and if I can't go what will happen to our money.  I am also worried about going back to work and my kids going back to school and how we will manage to get back into a rountine.  However I am enjoying being with my family and a slower pace of life. I am catching up on myself and things I wanted to do.
