I am Scared and fearful for what is happening on a daily basis, for what it is doing to all of those around us, even when this is over we will be living in a very different world which is also very scary to think about. 

I feel some media outlets are not giving the full correct information and twisting it slightly to sell papers.  This is causing a lot more issues for many people and they should also be fined by the government for doing this.

My hat goes off to all of those on the front line who have no choice but to deal with this and just carry on, those breaking government guidelines should be handed a very large fine.
