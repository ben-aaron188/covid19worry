The coronavirus still feels very unknown to me, even though this pandemic has been around for approximately 4 months now. The level of uncertainty in everyone's future is a large factor in the fear people are experiencing, including myself. I am worried for the future of my education, and for how the economy will suffer. It is unknown how the world as a whole will recover from this. Some people are still not taking the virus seriously, which is frustrating. If people worked together more and listened to governmental guidelines, maybe this would be over sooner.
