At the moment I’m very worried about what will happen in the next few weeks, how this will affect my job and ultimately my family. I’m worried this will continue for several months and more jobs will be at risk and companies struggle to make money including the big corporations. I also feel a lot of boredom and depression at not being able to go out and doing anything. I’ve been isolated with my family now for 3 weeks and I’ve done everything around the house that needs doing and there is nothing to do. I’ve lost a lot of hope for the future and I’ve given up doing anything because what’s the point. I wake up and every day is the same - I’m losing track of the days.
