In this very moment as I am fortunate to be able to work from home and feel comfortable and secure in my environment I am lucky to feel relaxed and well. However I am worried about the health and well-being of my family members and the long-term repercussions of the pandemic on society, especially the more vulnerable in society such as those who are economically weaker, self-employed, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. I am  concerned about the implications of the pandemic for my own job security and that of my friends and family, but as I cannot control the situation, I am feeling calm and doing my bit to flatten the curve by following the government's instructions to stay at home.
