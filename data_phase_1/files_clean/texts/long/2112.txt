It makes me angry that the media is feeding lies into society to drive fear. It is disgusting how many people are happy to submit to a state enforced home incarceration regime. It is easy to fool people but difficult to convince them they are being fooled. One day they will realise the truth but by then it will be too late. Keeping people under house arrest will not stop the spread of the so called virus. The level of imposed control and over reach of powers by the police is draconian and extreme.
