I'm viewing the process of social distancing and shutdown as a chance for elements of society and the workplace to develop and reset, particularly in terms of inclusivity and working norms. I am not in any risk groups and I honestly feel quite relaxed about the whole thing. I am normally a mildly-moderately anxious person but I have not felt this calm for so long in years. I recognise that what is happening is significant and that I am in an extremely lucky position (able to work from home, not vulnerable, et cetera), and I do feel for those on the front lines or who lose loved ones. But ultimately I am really quite calm and relaxed. I am a little more apprehensive about the situation when things get back to normal but again, demographically I am unlikely to suffer substantial distress.
