My biggest fear at present is that my elderly parents may contract this disease and I feel helpless at the moment. I am also extremely worried about the impact this crisis is having on me financially as I have not been able to work for over 3 weeks and am dipping into my savings to survive. I live in a small flat on the first floor of an apartment block in London and am finding it very difficult at present as I only leave the flat once a day to go for a walk or get some groceries. My family are all in Ireland and I have to rely on phone calls to check on their well being which adds to my anxiety and stress levels.
