I feel let down by my employers who are failing to provide sufficient PPE. I am a Police Officer, so don't have the option to stay at home. I feel nervous that I will contract the virus and bring it home to my pregnant wife and child. I am fed up of not being able to see my wider family, and I am fed up at not being able to do the things I normally enjoy doing, like training at the gym, and meeting friends. I feel hatred toward those who flout the rules and think that they can carry on as normal.
