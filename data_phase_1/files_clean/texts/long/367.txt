I feel very anxious about not being able to control how our country react to social distancing and other ways of slowing the spread. For my family i worry about every similar symptom they have and hope if they do contract it that they recover.
I am very appreciative of being able to spend this quality time with my family and it has made me realise that we need to slow down and enjoy the simpler things in life.
As a carer for my father i worry about him being alone much more but do as much as i can for him, it's a constant worry that i may spread the virus to him also if i contract it. 
I get extremely angry when we go for our daily exercise as a family, not only do we see people out chatting to others, but we also come across a lot of people who do not respect the 2m rule meaning there has been several instances where we haven't been able to avoid passing close to people because of their selfishness.
