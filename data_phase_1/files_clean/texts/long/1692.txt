I personally am not concerned that much about the virus. If I catch, then so be it. My only concern is for all the idiots going out shopping because they have some unexpected time off work. I work in a food/hardware store and around 80% of people coming to the store are NOT buying essential items, at all. 
My daily schedule has barely changed, other than the store is closing earlier than normal while this problem is over with. I am limited slightly in doing things such as shopping or going to the laundrette, as all the stores are often empty and laundrette is only open for limited times. As for social distancing, it is quite difficult while at work as we seem to have more customers now than we ever had before. I don't think the government are doing enough to enforce the lockdown, but short of enforcing a curfew, I don't see that changing as we really don't have the resources to make it work, evident in all the traffic still on the roads each day.
