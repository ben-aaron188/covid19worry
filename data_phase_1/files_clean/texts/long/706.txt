I am very worried that the situation is getting worse and the general public are not taking it seriously enough.  The Government needs to increase lockdown and bring more punishment for those risking going out, this makes me angry that people are not listening and thinking it will never happen to them.  They are putting others at risk with this attitude.

I have just been Furloughed today and whilst I will financially be ok, I am worried about my job after this is all over.

It makes me sad that so many people are passing away and the death toll is increasing every day.  It seems to be getting closer to home now, local people getting coronavirus and celebrities which makes you realise it could attack anyone.
