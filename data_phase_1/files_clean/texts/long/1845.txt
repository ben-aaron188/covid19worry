Right now I feel quite nervous due to this pandemic. With hearing bad news daily about the situation makes me feel anxious and upset. I am trying to be positive but a lot has been put on hold which I find quite annoying especially that there isn’t much you can do about this but to have hope things will get better. Observing the news can be quite depressing as well as we are constantly reminded of deaths happening and even towards the nhs. It’s unbelievable what they have to go through and endure as it’s a lot worse for them because they see this first hand. However, it does anger me that some people are not taking this seriously at all and are not social distancing, it will mean that we won’t deal with this as quickly as we want.
