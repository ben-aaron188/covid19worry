I feel stressed at this situation because people aren’t listening to the government. I also feel stressed because my job as a healthcare assistant is 10 times harder due to having to isolate our residents and pushing them out of routine, therefore watching them deteriorate. They also can’t see their families so they feel abandoned and it’s sad to watch. It also stresses me out that the government have said children can still move to each home because they don’t want to ‘knock’ their routine, but not once have they thought about the elderly in homes or autistic people who thrive off of routine.
