It is the unknown and that is the scariest part. The constant media coverage does not help anxiety, especially when there is little new news about it to report - just hear the same things over again.
Anger at people flouting the rules but equally understand how it is difficult to be on lockdown. 
Fearful for my family who live at the other end of the country - if something happens there is nothing I can do to see them. 
Happy that at present all my family are well, but feeling pressure from work, especially my husband as told today he will get a pay cut.
