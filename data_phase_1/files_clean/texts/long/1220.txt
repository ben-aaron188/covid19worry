I feel afraid for the people I know especially my family and friends. I feel sad for the people who have lost their lives especially my uncle who was in hospital alone died alone and was cremated alone. I am anxious all the time and don't sleep well. I am grateful to all the NHS staff and the carers, especially the one who are looking after my 86 year old Dad who has dementia and won't understand why I'm not there. I am nervous when the phone rings incase it is bad news about dad. I am jumpy at sudden noises but frightened to hear the quietness when I am in my garden. I am scared that I won't find enough food for my family.
