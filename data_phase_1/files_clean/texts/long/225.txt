I'm worried about how long this situation will last, as well as its impact on economy. I'm also anxious with regard to whether my job hunting plan will be affected, whether I will be able to get an extension of working permit if the current situation will last for a long time. Apart from this, shopping has become less convenient under the current situation; I wonder when things will get back to normal. However, I do not think the risk of being infected by the virus is high, as long as people follow the guidelines from the government.
