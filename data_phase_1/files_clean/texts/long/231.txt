I currently feel okay, I am safe in my house and neither myself or my partner have any symptoms. I am beginning to feel restless at the thought of the lock down lasting for many more weeks, but I'm still happy to comply to make sure myself, my family and community will be safe. I have stopped looking at online news and restricted my social media time as the constant influx of information and opinions was taking a negative toll on my mental health. I am beginning to question a number of things about the virus and its spread, but am trying not to get too bogged down in the idea of conspiracy theories, as this is not conducive to my mental health either.
