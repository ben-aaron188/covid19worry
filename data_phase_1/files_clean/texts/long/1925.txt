I feel disgust for the government who have not prepared well and don't seem to have taken the threat as seriously as they should have. I feel angry that some people are not taking lockdown as seriously, and yet I have to work in a London hospital as a key worker, potentially putting my health at risk. But, I feel optimistic that Italy appears to have passed its peak and we are probably one week away from reaching ours. This makes me feel proud that we are on the right track. I think we locked down too late but once we did this will have had an effect.
