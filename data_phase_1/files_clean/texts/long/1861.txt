Right at this moment Im trying not to get my hopes up too much
I notice in Spain and Italy they seem to be reaching the peak of people affected with the virus and as we are about a month behind them I can see things hopefully getting better by the end of June.
The panic nuying in the supermarkets seems to be calming down and people are taking the social distancing more seriously than they were beifore
I am still very my anxious and worried especially about my elderly parents who have not been outside for 3 weeks now Im lucky that they have very good neighbours who have been getting food and other suplies for them but it is still a concern as both are in the very vunleable groups.
Personally I am concerned I will catch it and I dont have a great history of physical and mental health so I would rather avoid the virus if I could
I just hope the virus peaks soon and we can all get back to work and our lives as normal
