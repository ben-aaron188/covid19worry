I'm worried how long that the cornavirus threat will go on for and how many people will die or become very sick.  And if there will be work afterwards as that will effect every one mood and happiness. When can we finally see our family and friends especially if they are unwell and help help that is scary also. 
I am also concerned that it's going to go mad when its spread country eude in Africa and I die as people living poor sill have no chance. That is all the points that I currently feel about the current situation regarding the cornavirus pandemic that is affecting the United kingdom and the rest of the world right now.
