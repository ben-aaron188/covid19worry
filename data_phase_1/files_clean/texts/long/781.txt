The situation is concerning but I feel that it is following the trend and pattern expected following social distancing measures.  I am encouraged that society at large seems to be following the current advice without to much objection.  I am confident that we will overcome the virus but concerned that the change to our society may last for a long time.  The economic impact will be severe and I worry about how we will be able to revert back to normal life within as short a time as possible.  I am a little uncertain about the actual severity of the disease in relation to seasonal flu but have to accept the information given to me by the media and the Government at this stage,
