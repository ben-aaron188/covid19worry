I am scared for my family and friends. I do not understand why a vaccine has not been found yet. There's too much of it on the news and not all is true. The news terrifies me and there is no end and no plan. We need a plan. More needs doing to find better treatment, fast, as well as a vaccine. My heart breaks that I cant see my grandparents and niece and nephew.. I'm disabled and live with my mum, my carer. Noone has said what I do if I need care if my carer gets ill. We live in a world where we should know how to handle this, but we dont. I do not want to know when this will end, I want to know how it will end.
