Primarily, I feel anxious and worried about family members and myself. I am fearful about going outside and to the supermarket but in the past I have felt that way about leaving the house when we weren't in the midst of a pandemic, so it's not such a huge adjustment to me personally. I also feel some anger towards the government's lack of clarity and response to this situation, but less angry at the minute than I felt a few weeks back. I feel quite overwhelmed by stories of people and businesses coming together to support each other (which means I cry so easily at the minute), and a little bit relieved at having to slow down in regards to work because that was something that brought me a great deal of stress.
