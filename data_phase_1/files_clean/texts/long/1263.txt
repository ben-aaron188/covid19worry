Sometimes I feel quite calm because I am isolating/quarantining at home and I am used to being at home quite a lot due to being a student with low contact hours. I also have a lot of university work to keep my mind occupied. However, I am finding it hard to concentrate and get motivation to do my studying. I try to avoid too much exposure to information/news etc about the Corona Virus, but deep down I am worried when I see the daily death numbers increasing in the UK. I worry that even a short trip to the supermarket could result in myself or a family member catching it and possibly becoming seriously ill. Everything is very unknown at the moment and even the government are unsure about how long this will last. I am glad that the government are putting stricter measures in to enforce lockdown and social distancing, but news reports don't seem to indicate that this is working yet. I fear that people will stop isolating as time goes on and they become more fed up with being at home all the time.
