I feel really anxious about the current situation. I am worried about my health and for my young children. I’m fearful of what is to come and if, how and when we are going to make it through. I wish that we could all be tested right now to find out if we have had it or if we have immunity to it. I find it uncomfortable seeing my children confused and I fear that it’s going to get a lot harder before it gets better. I think that we’re going to be in more severe lockdown and I know that will be detrimental to my mental health and I will struggle to cope
