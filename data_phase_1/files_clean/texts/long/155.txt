I feel anxious about what the future holds. I am working from home and staying indoors. I am angry at those they are not obeying the rules of lockdown. I feel a lot of uncertainty about what our future holds. We are in the middle of a house sale which is adding more anxiousness into the situation, not knowing whether this will go ahead. 

I am frustrated about shopping online. Ocado have cancelled our weekly slot meaning we now have to go to the shop which goes against lockdown rules. When we do go to the shop, we can only manage to buy half of what is on our list, with basic ingredients being compromised.
