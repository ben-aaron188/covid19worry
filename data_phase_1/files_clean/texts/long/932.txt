Going stir crazy. Not getting anything done, as it always seems like may as well do it tomorrow, as tomorrow is pretty much the same as today.
Somewhat concerned for my own heath, and particularly concerned for friends and relatives who are ore vulnerable. E.g. my 95 year-old dad, who believes that covid-19 would be a death sentence. 
Worried about how this will ever end, no exit strategy seems like a good one - lockdown can't go on for ever, but any relaxation of the rules will put people like my dad t extreme risk.
