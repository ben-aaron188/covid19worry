I have been laid off from my job and have no income whatsoever anymore nor help from the government, it is the uncertainty that is the worst part. The introspection that comes with the lockdown is also very anxiety-laiden. I worry about how or when I will be able to next receive any income. All I can hope is that Keir does a UBI, otherwise, young people like me have no reason to look into the future with any hope whatsoever. I have been driven to filling in online surveys for 50p a pop, and hoping I can learn some skills somehow so one day I can be able to pay my own rent and buy food that isn't tinned beans. I am scared.
