I am not overly worried. I am following the advice given and am certain that I will not get this virus. I do not think that this virus will kill as many people as influenza does every year. I am also interested to see how Sweden fairs compared to other countries that have imposed a lockdown when they have not. There is also many people who I have come across when shopping for basic supplies who are not following rules regarding social distancing. Since this began there is less vehicle and air traffic which means less pollution for the planet which is now starting to repair the damage done by the human race. However this will be negated when all this comes to an end. Maybe the human race is the disease and viruses the cure.
