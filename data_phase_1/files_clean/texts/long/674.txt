For the most part, I've felt absolutely fine during this situation, of course, I miss seeing some of my family and friends however I am very used to being indoors a lot so I've found this experience pretty normal for me.

I've actually felt pretty good due to the virus as I have been offered an unconditional offer due to these current events so I'm quite happy with the outcome so far.

However, I have felt rather upset about the growing number of doctors and nurses dying from the virus on the front lines, I hope they are all remembered for their great sacrifice during these hard times.

I greatly respect a lot of communities coming together to help one another out such as people buying supplies for their neighbours that might be more vulnerable to this virus than others.
