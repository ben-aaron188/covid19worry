It's frustrating to say the least. Pissed off would be a good way of describing my mood towards this whole situation, especially given how we're all stuck indoors. I'm hopeful that the situation will be resolved but man, I can't help but feel selfish and bitter towards this whole thing. Sure, I understand we're isolating for our fellow people, but after a point, enough is enough right?

How many liberties are going to be taken away after this? How long will this drag on for? How are my job prospects after this? Why isn't there a better solution? Why is the NHS so fragile and underfunded? So many questions.
