My general anxiety (which is always a bit heightened) has been quite high lately, making me worry more about family and friends and my own health,but it also plays out in other areas of my life - I have trouble making decisions. I struggle to focus working from home when I can't go out and distract myself. I miss human contact and I cannot go and see my family in Germany. At the same time I feel relieved to be forced into a slower pace where I have time to dedicate myself to my hobbies and things i have been putting off.
