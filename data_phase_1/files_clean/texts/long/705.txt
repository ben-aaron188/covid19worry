I feel that as long as people cooperate and behave properly the situation will improve and spreading rates will decrease. I am worried about vulnerable members of my family as it affects everyone. I have found my university that I attend to has been uncooperative adding to a lot of stress while living at home however remaining to understand that it is a difficult time for people. Feel there are people (particularly younger generations) who feel they are invincible due to younger people being less affected and are still going to see friends but are still developing risk when they go to shops or essential work.
