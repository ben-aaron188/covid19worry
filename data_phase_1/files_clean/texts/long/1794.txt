I feel very afraid and frustrated with how some aren’t taking it seriously. A colleague has died from this and it all changes when it’s someone you know. Also when you are not an essential worker or a key worker and told that but are made to go into work travelling on tube it’s very stressful. I feel like my brain can’t comprehend what is happening around me. I worry for my family and friends. I Struggle with anxiety anyway and this is just crazy. Thankfully I can sleep but I find every day exhausting. I feel very very scared and worried.
