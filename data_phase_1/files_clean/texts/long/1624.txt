It is very scary as don’t know what is happening and scared to get it as I have kids. I haven’t been outside at all and all the people on streets are not helping. We need stricter laws as people are using exercise and 1 walk as an excuse and making it worse for everyone. People are not taking the serious about it. People complain about  how long it’s taking to get back into work and the wages crisis so if they don’t stay at home how are we ment to deal with the sitioation faster. They are lengthening the time for everyone and passing. There is no social distancing with kids. Teenagers are still on the back streets on bike cars quads and it’s ridiculous. The government need to put a total ban on going out except work people. All shopping should be online only in food stores as I find the Long queue stupid, like people are still stocking or something. My opinion is I think it’s just an excuse to be out and that’s the only way they can be out longer. Get all shopping online and make it safer for retail aswel as ourselves. Book online and get it dropped off or picked up, it will be much faster. This way everyone will be inside except workers
