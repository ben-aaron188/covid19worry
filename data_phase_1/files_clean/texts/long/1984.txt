I’m feeling apprehensive about the next few weeks, how long we will be on lockdown.  I have older family members who I worry about catching corona virus and not making it. 
I worry for my kids education, exams missed and education stopped. Will they be able to pick up where they left off. Will this affect their future?
I’m anxious about the food situation in supermarkets. Whether there will be enough to get through to the end of the lockdown. People are tending to over buy and not leaving enough for everyone else.
