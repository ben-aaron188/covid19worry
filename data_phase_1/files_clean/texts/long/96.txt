I feel very concerned as people aren’t listening to advice and also are posing a threat to others. I feel worried about my elderly parents whom I’m not able to see either as they are on the high risk register. I feel anxiety about the lack of routine for my kids and their needs. I worry about the impact on them in the future for exam results and also on their mental well-being and mine as well as it’s beyond weird. 
Children are asking questions about how to cope with this behaviour and what to do and we don’t have the answers either sadly
