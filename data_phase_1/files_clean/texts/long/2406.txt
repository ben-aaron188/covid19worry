The situation feels like it's improving. 
No one in my close circle has been effected majorly. 
My work situation has changed to remote work, so that has been interesting to workaround. 
I have no major financial worries due to the corona virus. 
Interested to see how the world economy and international relations change over the coming year or so. I feel as though countries such as the UK and USA will bring more industry internal, especially that of medical origin. 
I feel as though my country will learn and develop in a positive way after all is said and done.
