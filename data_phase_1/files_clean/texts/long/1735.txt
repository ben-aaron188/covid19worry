Very worried I might get it if go out for supplies and angry that no emergency measures so everyone could get deliveries so they did not get infected.
even more worried 82 year old father,my only family may get it and die,do no want him to suffer and afraid too,of being alone and having no money.
sad and annoyed and disgusted at all the problems that almosteveryone is suffering from,
sad about the deaths
worried about future for self and many others.
Disgusted there seemed no government plans in place and so little stocks of basics for nhs and everyone
