I am not feeling anything major with respect to the Coronavirus situation. I am following government advice and staying at home and I believe that's all I can do. I do not necessarily feel anxiety due to the virus.  

I heard yesterday that one of my family friends' wife sadly passed away due to Coronavirus yesterday, and that made this pandemic feel real. I was taking it seriously, to begin with, but having it happen to someone you more or less know is frightening but it has not effected my mental state that much. I feel like if it happens, then it happens.
