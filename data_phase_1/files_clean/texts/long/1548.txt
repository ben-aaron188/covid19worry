I'm worried about it.  Even though I am only going to the store once a week I feel like I'll probably pick it up from there!  I have decided to go on a dating site to get a headstart on meeting new people when the lockdown is over so I actually feel kind of relaxed and excited for when this is all over.  I have also been trying to keep preoccupied by talking to people, playing games, reading books instead of news articles as I feel like this just makes me panic more and I find distraction and looking towards the future is more helpful.
