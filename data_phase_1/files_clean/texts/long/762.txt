I am so worried about my family members as i just had my baby and he is only 2 weeks old so i am so worried  about him as his immune system is still developing. I feel like still there are more people don't take this serious and because of that it will be hard to control.It makes me so angry towards those people and making my anxiety level  very high. Even we are staying at home and obey all the rules i am so worried still this can catch any of my family members. So i think country shoud go for a total lock down for few weeks at least so this can be controlled than now
