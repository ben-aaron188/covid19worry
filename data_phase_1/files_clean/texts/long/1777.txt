I feel worried and exhausted, because my close people are at high risk group. Both my MIL and FIL are cancer survivors and have weak immune system. Also I'm worrying about financial situation in my family and our economy in general. I'm working from home and homeschooling my child, so I'm also tired more than usual, because of the added responsibilities. And I miss my mum, siblings and friends. All that makes me feel sad, worried, sometimes anxious, exhausted, sometimes restless and unable to stop worrying
