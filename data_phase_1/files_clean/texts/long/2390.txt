The current Corona situation makes me feel apprehensive.  Although some countries are seeing a slow decline in rates of infection and death, there is still a lot of fear in other countries. How the world will change when the infection has passed is also a cause for concern.  There seems to be a lot of misinformation being reported within in the media and it is hard to know which sources to trust.  The government are doing a fairly good job but I feel having the antigen tests available would ease some of the concerns.
