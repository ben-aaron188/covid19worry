I think its just a feeling of groundhog day, every day seems to merge into the last when you cant really leave your house very much.
Also the feeling of lost experiences for the year, with sports/concerts etc being cancelled, there isnt much to really have to look forward too which is a big shame.
Uncertainty for how the future looks and what the exit strategy looks like. It seems pretty obvious that this thing is unfortunately going to be around for a long while and with a vaccine likely 12-18 months away, rolling lock downs seem like they will be the way forward until some kind of medical process appears to allow the easing of symptoms.
I am hopeful that the current lock downs and social distancing measures will yield the results that we all want at slowing the spread of the virus as this can be seen happening around Europe at the moment.
I also very much being able to visit my friends and family, although video calls are a good alternative its not really the same, and you do wonder how long it will be before we can meet up with them again.
