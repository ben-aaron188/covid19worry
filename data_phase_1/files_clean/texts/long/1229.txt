I feel hopeless and frustrated that everyone is not doing what the government have requested and thus enabling the spread of the virus, it is a very scary and frustrating time not knowing if i will see certain family members again and the fact that people are knowingly putting people i love in danger is frustrating to me. I just want to spend my youth doing what i love and not living fear of what could happen. I am very sad and just feel very confused, staying inside for long periods is what we have to do but it is increasingly difficult, and is putting a strain on my mental health and my relationships with the people i am quarantined with.
