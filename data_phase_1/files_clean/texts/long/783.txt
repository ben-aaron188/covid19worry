I have anxiety about the future. I wonder what life will be like when this is over, will I lose my job, will we be able to the buy the house we are in the process of buying? I have moments where don't think about the fear of the future, the worry about my parents or the anxiety about the situation as a whole, and in those moments I am relatively relaxed and happy here in our little bubble of home. I am quite enjoying the physical aspect of the lockdown, I have more time for exercise, reading, puzzles, but the mental stress is much higher than usual. I am unable to concentrate as much as I usually am and I find myself sitting and thinking or being entirely without motivation for long periods of time.
