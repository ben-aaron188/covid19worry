Relaxed as working from home but worry about family and friend, my sister is a front line nurse so Im concerned about how much contact she comes into with people who may have the Corona virus.
Im also concerned for my job as the business I work for is affected by Corona due to falling sales due to the lockdown the country is currently operating under. If the lockdown continues we will have to make redundancies and reduce hours, therefore reducing salaries and there is also a chance that the business may well go out of business if this continues for too long.
