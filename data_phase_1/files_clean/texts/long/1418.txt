i am very anxious about the virus, i am scared to go out shopping in case i catch it.  I worry about passing the virus on to my parents,s i have to shop for them and leave shopping at a safe distance as well as getting prescriptions. On the other hand i wish i could get it and get it over with, its like waiting for it to happen, it is a truly awful situation.
I hope the government are telling us the truth about what is happening, and hope that we can all be tested and find a cure/ vaccination.
Once a vaccination has been found there should be an investigation as to how all this began in the first place and how we can avoid this happening again.
