I feel stressed and anxious about people ignoring the rules and advice and socialising anyway. I’m not so concerned about my own health, more for family and friends and frontline workers. I think that the lack of proper protection equipment for NHS workers is depressing and worrying. I think the Government have an unprecedented task, but they seemed lacklustre to begin with and the regulations are not being enforced.
I think some people think they’re invincible and are not worried about the health of others. This is causing the spread and is very worrying to me. I’m also concerned that if we have to self isolate, there are no supermarket delivery slots. I understand why a lot of these have been reserved for vulnerable people, but then how do those who  have to self isolate access food?
