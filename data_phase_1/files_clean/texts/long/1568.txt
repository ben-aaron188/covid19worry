Sadness for those who are dealing with the loss of family, friends and loved ones.  Concern for people who have to keep working - whether shop staff and delivery drivers, transport workers, key workers, NHS and other people in blue light roles.

Some anger and despair at how badly the government are handling this and communicating about it - such garbled and badly phrased messaging which doesn't resonate with people. Furious that the government continually lie, about the number of ventilators, tests, availability of PPE kit.  I despise Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson for decimating the NHS of funds and setting the route for privatisation of medicine in the UK, and now they expect the NHS to save their political careers.
