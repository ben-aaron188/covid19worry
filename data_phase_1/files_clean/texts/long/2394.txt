I am fearful for the health of two relatives; one my husband who has many health issues and I suspect would not survive if he were infected by COVID19; also my daughter in law, a young mother of two, who has cystic fibrosis. We are self isolating ( in two separate households) and feel relatively safe at the moment, but until a vaccine is available, the threat will remain. We expect scientists to achieve this within a year. I'm so glad we have the internet and phone to keep in touch with family, and would feel distraught if these lines of communication were cut. We are so far doing supermarket shopping online but slots are becoming harder to secure so the future is uncertain.
