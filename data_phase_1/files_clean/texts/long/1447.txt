I'm worried. I'm missing my family, I normally see my parents, sister and nephew every week at least and I haven't seen them for a few weeks now because of this. I'm worried about my finances and my family's health. My son wants back to school. It's scary and many people aren't taking it seriously enough and are still going out. I'm furloughed right now and I'm thankful that for now I still have a job but it's an ongoing worry about what will happen in the future, depending on how long this situation goes on for.
