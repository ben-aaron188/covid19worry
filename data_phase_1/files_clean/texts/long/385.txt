Anxious about the uncertainty about how long this will last, disruptions to university studies, being away from family. I hope they don't ban all outdoor exercise because that's one of the few things that are keeping me sane at the moment. Uncertain about the future, and how the changes to my studies will affect my career after university. Low motivation to carry out daily activities and studies. Social interaction is greatly reduced, leading to feelings of isolation. Disappointed at how some people have reacted to the situation, such as hoarding supermarket items and disregarding rules around social distancing.
