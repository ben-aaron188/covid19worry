I feel that it is a big distraction from everyday life as it was. I'm looking forward to things going back to normal. 
Seeing my friends and family will also be good. 
I'm looking forward to celebrating my freedom from being staying at home more than I usually do.
It does feel strange being outside and seeing a lot of people wearing masks and gloves. It almost feels like I'm in a movie. In some regards a bit shocking when I least expected it when  people had not only a mask but other things covering there face.
