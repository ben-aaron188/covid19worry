I feel like people could be doing more to stop the spread of the virus. It upsets me to see people socialising and having barbecues ect. This is not pleasent for anyone but the sooner we stop the spread the sooner we can go back to normality. I think the government is doing an okay job with regards to keeping people informed with daily news briefings and TV adverts. But they are not doing enough to protect our front line health workers. I am greatful for our front line NHS workers and I am amazed by the number of people who have come out of retirement to risk their lives to save others. I am hopeful that society will develop a bettrer appreciation for our key workers. Our doctors, our nurses, transport workers, supermarket workers and delivery drivers. It is them not the bankers that keep the world going.
