Very very unsure, largely because of my personal financial situation, the future of my education and the looming recession. We are unsure whether we can afford to be out of work for this long, let alone whether I can pay for university going forward. Even if I can afford to go back, I am unsure when my education will continue as all educational institutions are currently in a state of limbo. In addition, there is plenty of fear for myself and my family due to our statuses as at risk persons. In particular, the isolation, uncertainty and lack of a specific time frame has taken a great toll on my mental health.
