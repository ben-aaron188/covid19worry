I find the Corona situation very sad as I can’t go out and see my family or friends at the moment due to social distancing. It is also sad to see people ignoring government advice and still having parties and meeting up with friends as this is very dangerous. I am experiencing a bit of anxiety regarding the disease because it is so contagious and I wouldn’t want any elderly or vulnerable people to be susceptible to it so it is for the best that they are shielded as much as possible. There is also a big sense of not knowing what is going to happen after the disease starts to dip, concerning the economic structure of the country which is worrying.
