I am concerned about the situation, it seems as though it's coming closer to home, as my family now know of a few people who have died from it, and one who fingers crossed is on the mend. This evening just underlined the seriousness of it when it was announced that Boris Johnson had been moved to intensive care. I think it's a concern because it isn't just elderly people or people with pre-existing health conditions, nobody is safe from this. I have read that the peak is expected to be at Easter, which is still a week away, so that is worrying.
