Sad and angry as people aren’t following rules. Anxious as we don’t know when this will end. Angry as people don’t understand how it’s affecting everyone and their lives id they don’t take it seriously as people are dying and losing their jobs as they are out of business. Including myself, I have not worked for 3 weeks and I am sad that my life is now stuck inside while people are still meeting friends as if that is ok.   I am annoyed as well as they need to enforce how important it is to stay at home to prevent the spread of this.
