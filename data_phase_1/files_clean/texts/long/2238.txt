The Corona situation is worrying and overwhelming but it can be managed. It is just a matter of everyone taking responsibility and following instructions issued by the authorities. We need to look after one another by doing our individual bits and making sure that we are doing everything in our power to look after the health of others on top of ours. It is sad to see others dying and going through this painful disease where their loved ones are not even allowed to be near them to comfort them.
Once people understand the extent to which this disease affects an individual then they will be more likely to follow the rules and follow what the authorities have asked us to do.
