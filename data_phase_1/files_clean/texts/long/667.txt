Incredibly sad that the world will never be the same again - and fearful for what will remain when we leave lockdown.  The isolation didn't bother me at first but living alone can be a lonely experience.  It is the not knowing when normal life will resume that is the most difficult aspect of this whole thing to comprehend and absorb.  

I feel terribly sorry and appreciate all the good work that all of our emergency services are currently doing - From the nhs to the police to all retail employees - they are making a horrible situation bearable for everybody else, and putting themselves at risk whilst doing it - This is a really thankless task that they are undertaking and we all really appreciate it
