I feel very anxious about the amount of resources and man power available to our NHS which are essential to overcome this, but don't seem to be able to cope with the number of people getting ill due to the lack of funding and support given to the NHS over the last decade. I'm extremely worried about someone I love dying from this, and about accidentally passing the virus on to someone, though as far as I'm aware I've never had it. I'm very irritated by the people who refuse to take it seriously, and by those who put themselves above everyone else by taking an unfair amounts of food so that those in need or who are more vulnerable suffer.
