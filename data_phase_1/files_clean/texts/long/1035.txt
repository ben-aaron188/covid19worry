I feel very worried about the virus. I am a key worker and constantly worry about the vulnerable people I support and my own family. 
I recently brought a house and am renovating with my boyfriend. We do not currently live together so because of the lockdown I am unable to see him. 
I feel annoyed at the people ignoring the lockdown meaning it has to be extended and stops us seeing loved ones. 
Iâ€™m worried the people still going out are going to continue to risk the lives of other people for selfish reasons.
