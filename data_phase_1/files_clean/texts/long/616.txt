At the beginning of the outbreak i don't think people were taking it as serious as it should have been, and even today people are still going out regularly and it's terrible to see how people don't care enough about spreading the virus around but rather see their friends at the park for no reason, I just think its hard to wrap my head around how this whole thing occurred and how quickly its being spread around because of sheer carelessness from the public, in all honesty it makes me worry about the future mixed with the feeling of confusion and anger
