Anxious and uncertain about the future, don’t know what to expect or when things will go back to normal. It’s also very sad what is going on and the mood is mellow at the moment because so many people are suffering. It is also not nice to know that we potentially will not get a summer because that is the most exciting time of year and this might not be over by then. Like anybody else I am waiting for things to go back to normal because right now it is a very strange time and nobody knows what to think
