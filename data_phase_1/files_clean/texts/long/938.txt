Today I feel very sad because I miss loved ones, especially my partner, my mum and sisters etc.  We are shielding due to my son's serious heart condition.  My partner moved out to continue to work and bring supplies. I feel anxious about the number of people dying.  I am struggling to juggle my work from home, look after the kids and tidy the house etc.  I feel overwhelmed.   I'm tired because I can't sleep.  I'm finding it hard to concentrate.  I've been tearful all day.  I'm lucky we have a garden so can get fresh air but today it all feels too much.
