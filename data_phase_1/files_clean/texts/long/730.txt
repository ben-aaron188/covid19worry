I feel extremely relaxed and I  touch with friends and family. I'm listening to great music and making great art and watching the films and tv shows I've always wanted to watch. I'm glad to be getting to speak to friends who I've lost touch with. I'm stuck in England back in university and there is a travel ban back to India so I'm away from my family but I'm in my house in Durham and I'm with my housemate and we drink and have fun and watch TV shows and play board games. I feel much more relaxed than I felt before coronavirus hit and I go on a daily government mandated exercise (running) and I feel that keeps me healthy and fit as I dont have a lot of time to do that when university is in session.
