I feel disappointed in my countries response, more should of been done sooner similar to the South Korea response, and more support for workers should have been given rather than having to rely on companies being sensible. It has also made me more annoyed at other institutions, such as my University and the overall funding situation. However I am hopeful that it should blow over relatively soon and I do believe measures need to be taken that will affect me to protect others. I do wish this urgency could be used for issues that would be more likely to affect me as well.
