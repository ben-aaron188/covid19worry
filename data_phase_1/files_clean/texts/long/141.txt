I am terrified about the current corona situation. I am not worried about my own health but the health of my family members. My Nan has suspected Covid-19 and I am terrified as although right now she is okay, I am worried about the unpredictability of the virus and how it  could take a sudden turn. I miss my family and friends. The only positives is it is giving me time to wind down and get jobs done etc that I wouldn't otherwise have time to do. I prefer not to turn on the news as it makes me sad and worried. I can't wait till this is all over. I am responsible for my families main shopping but this fills me with anxiety.
