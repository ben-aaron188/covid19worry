It's very difficult to express emotion without guilt - I have a roof over my head, food, a reduced income (but enough), and relative personal safety for myself and an elderly parent. 

My entire identity as a musician has been erased by Covid-19. My diary is empty. I can't see the theatres opening again this side of Summer 2021. 

We just hear about death. The mortality rate would appear to be 10% (even though I know that the confirmed cases only reflect 8-10% of those infected). Deaths in ITU would appear to be 50%. The day is spent in constant low-grade terror. 

Rumours today that Boris Johnson is on a respirator. Dominic Raab is our very own Dan Quayle. Please let these just be rumours. 

People. Why can't people just stay home? Why do they think it won't touch them? 

Exit strategies. We don't have one, and the government isn't even willing to talk about one until we're past the peak. 

I don't think I am ever going to see someone I love again. This is irrational. We're speaking every day on the phone or by email, and yet this isn't enough. They don't seem real.
