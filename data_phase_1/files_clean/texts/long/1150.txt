Whilst I appreciate that this is a unique and historical time, I miss my normal daily life, and I miss being around the people that most care about.  I am worried that my car will not start when I go to use it and that petrol staitions will be closed,  I have a stack of parcels that I need to take to the post office, but I don't want to get shouted at because it's not essential business.  I am a little concerned that my medication will not arrive before what I have runs out, but I am happy that the soap operas are on today because I miss them.  I wish my neighbour would stop thumping around and I am trying to block it out.
