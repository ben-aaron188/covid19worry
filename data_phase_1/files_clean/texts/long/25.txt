Personally, I am fairly calm about the corona virus situation and am not panicking about the virus. M family and I have tried to buy what we need from the supermarkets without over stocking.
I believe that the corona virus lockdown is in place to ensure that the NHS can cope as the NHS is underfunded.
More people have died of the flu then corona, the death rate appers to be high because of the low numbers of tests available. If they were able to more tests then the death rate will be a fraction of 1%.


That being said, I believe that some sort of lock down is needed but it could have been done in a slight less strict way.
