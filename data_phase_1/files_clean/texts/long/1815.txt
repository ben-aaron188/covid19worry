It is less an much an issue of how it affects me, because the illness has a low hospitalization rate and even lower mortality rate, particularly for younger people such as myself. I am more worried about elderly family members who are far more likely to be severely affected than me. Some have heart conditions and high blood pressure which certainly wouldn't help matters. Although it is not particularly prevalent in my area, as the disease progresses it could easily become more common, as I live around 40 miles from the outskirts of London and many people in my community are commuters.
