I feel anxious and worried. I am really about to go nuts. I can’t see my future financially. I can’t benefit any government aid because I don’t have national insurance number in UK. Also I concern about my family’s health. They are living another country. I try to find a job and I afraid to be sick. I don’t have money and I don’t know what will I do. I have trouble sleeping at night because of anxiety. I am scared, nervous, unhappy and I can’t believe these days are real. When I wake up I wonder the world back to normal.
