I feel pretty frustrated by it, it’s affecting many people’s lives. I have lost 2 holidays now that were booked up. I know this isn’t a major thing but it’s just another reason I’m fed up with the virus and would like to see it disappear as soon as possible.
Although I’m starting to feel that maybe we are starting to reach a peak in cases. I’ve noticed cases starting to drop across many parts of Europe so hopefully we are going to see this trend continue. Too many lives are being lost to this virus
