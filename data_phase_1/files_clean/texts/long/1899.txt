I feel like a lot went wrong in the beginning that has made things worse, and that a lot of innocent people are going to die because of government incompetence and idiots who choose to ignore the lockdown rules. I'm sad that we didn't have a better government in power when this all started. I'm angry as well that everything they do is a slow reaction, and that there are money-hungry people who are using this to make more money. I am also nervous as my partner is a 'vulnerable' person (born with a heart condition) while I watch our stupid neighbours hang out with their friends in the street.
