surpirised this hasn't happened before now, people need to be calmer about the situation in general and focus on improving their own sitiuation rather than deflecting blame onto others. People who don't quarantine are disgrace on society and should forfeit any help given to them by governments.  Hopefully this will help people be better with finances than they have previously been with spending on non essentials.  Will be surprised if things get back to how they were previously and think that quarantines will continue for at least 6 months
