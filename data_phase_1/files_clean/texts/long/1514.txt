Its a scary time that i thought that is ould never face. I thought maybe if things get really bad we may see something like a war and that worry had always had me on edge but I never thought that a virus would put the whole world on lockdown. I'm missing my friends and extended family lots and I feel completely disconnected with the world. it makes me really unhappy but I also know that we in the UK are on lockdown for our own benefit. i just wish it wasn't so contagious and I wish it hadn't already killed so many people including people so young in age
