I feel fearful of the health of my family, especially my grandparents. I am sad because I have lost my job and I'm losing my apartment this week. I feel anxious because I don't know what's going to happen.
I feel driven, a desire to retake control In my life
I feel lonely, I live on my own and I miss my friends, family and partner greatly.
Losing so much due to the outbreak and not being financially stable for it not to effect me makes me feel like a failure 
I try my best not to be negative or let in depressed emotions
