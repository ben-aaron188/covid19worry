I feel worried for my family. I feel anxious for my daughter whos has asd and cerebral palsy. Im scared that I cant keep my son safe from her anger. Im scared that theres nothing I cand o about any of this and just have to wait and hope we will all be ok I feel sad that people arent taking it seriously and are flouting the rules, I feel conflicted between needing to go out for a walk daily or my daughter will be climbing the walls making our house unsafe but knowing in order for the most people to survive that we need to be stricter. Im confused and scared and anxious constanlty
