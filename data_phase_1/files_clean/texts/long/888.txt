The coronavirus infection figure for Salford is scaring . I can’t afford to visit the shopping centre. I am afraid that using the basket in the shop could be a point of infection. I am seriously praying that this pandemic should pass so that I can regain my sanity. My mental health is also been affected. I can hardly concentrate on my hobbies while locked down in my home. I sometime feel that the world is about to end. While I have tried al measure to stabilise , it seems it not working. Among my worries are the destabilising effect of this pandemic on my finance in the coming weeks. I am literally getting broke and the government palliative measures such as furlough doesn’t cover the type of work I currently do.
