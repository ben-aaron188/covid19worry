i am feeling very worried that somebody i know, or myself, may catch the virus and become very ill or die.  i am worried about how long this lockdown will last, and the impact this will have on our mental and physical health.  I am concerned about how long i will be expected to work from home, as my job is very difficult to do from home and i feel a bit useless.  however, i am enjoying relaxing at home and not being expected to be anywhere at a particular time.  i am enjoying the nice weather and am using the opportunity to get my garden in order.
