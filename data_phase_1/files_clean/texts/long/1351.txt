I am frustrated with the restrictions, concerned about older relatives and also friends who are working in the NHS. 
I contend that the Government has endangered more UK lives with its haphazard approach in which herd immunity seemed to be the policy, where testing is minimal and health workers are not appropriately protected. So yes as a result of all of this, I do feel anger, mainly towards the government who now seems to be scapegoating elements of British society. Also, the Police with the new regulations or guidelines are sometimes overstepping in their interventions.
