I feel inspired by the community spirit at present. However the few individual who are not abiding by the lockdown instructions are infuriating me as they will only make it worse for all of us. I am busy with university work and so have not had time to get bored yet however I am sure that will come shortly. I am isolating with my family so I have people to keep me entertained. I am apart from my boyfriend which makes me sad but I know I am doing right by the country by not seeing him. I believe the country know what they are doing and preparing in the best way possible. I understand that many lives will be lost but the NHS will try to save as many as possible.
