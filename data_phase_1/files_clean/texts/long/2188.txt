I am worried for all of my friends and family. I also wish people would stay inside so it can be solved quicker. I am worried about when i will next be able to work again!  I miss my partner a lot, as he lives a fair few miles from me. So the only contact we get is phone calls. I am very worried for the people on the front lines and am so gratful for there work! 

I would volunteer/ apply for jobs if i saw any going near me but i work on a cruise ship and got back into the UK to late. the slots are all full.
