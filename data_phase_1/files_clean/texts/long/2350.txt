I am extremely concerned as I am classes as a 'vulnerable' person due to an existing condition and also have a young family. Fortunately I can continue to work but the prospect of being at home for 12 weeks with all of this going on outside definitely fills me with dread. I had been following the news intensely but was just finding it too much so have been trying to limit this - it's impossible to avoid rumours and speculation whenever I access social media but being in the house means it's constantly at my fingertips. It's a very stressful and challenging period in my life
