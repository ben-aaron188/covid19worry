The most difficult thing is not knowing what's going to happen next. It makes the anxiety much worse. I'm also concerned about the government's response as it seems lackluster at best. 
I'm also quite relaxed as most of the pressures/responsibilities in my life have disappeared. I'm really happy about how most people have acted as there is so much support and comiserating online and local practical support for vulnerable people. 
I am, however, angry at people who don't follow the social distancing rules as not only are they putting lives at risk but are only going to make all of this last longer and I have things to do.
