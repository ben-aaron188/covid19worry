I am concerned that nobody knows enough to guide us through successfully and so all action being taken isn't necessarily correct.

I feel almost as if we are free falling and hoping for the best.

Staying indoors can not be effective when household members are key-workers. we are permanently at risk here despite staying indoors and I am anxious.

What happens when it's time to rebuild the economy and how do we know when is the correct time to do this. What if it's too soon and we risk a new wave of the virus.
