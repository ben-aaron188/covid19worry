Nervous about mine and my families health.

Angry at people flaunting the ""lockdown"",just so they can be selfish.

Also Anger at how the British Government have been very slow in making any attempt to halt the spread of the virus.

Dishust at the media for how they are acring throughout this Pandemic,certain outlets seem to be trying to goad the public into hysteria,which does nobody any good and just causes more fear and anger.

Nothing more to add,why the need for a 500 minimum?
