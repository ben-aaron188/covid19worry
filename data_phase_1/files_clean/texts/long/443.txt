Angry that people can’t follow guidelines and insist on putting others at risk.
Sad that someone I am aquainted with has passed away due to this virus leaving behind a young family. 
Anxious that my children may be at risk as they attend the same school as my acquaintances  family. It’s all just a waiting game and I really wish that more testing was available to everyone but especially frontline staff. It shouldn’t take you being taken into hospital and basically be at deaths door before we can find out if we have been exposed/had the virus.
