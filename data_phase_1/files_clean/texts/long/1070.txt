Very sad time, 
NHS staff doing great job
Happy that uk is getting through this well, wish that the whole world could get closer and sort this out not like China not telling everyone how to cope with this and are making money uncalled for but I can’t do anything about this not only this but USA is doing a great job and so is uk nurses doctors and volunteers, I’m a little bit sad right now not just about me but about my family aswell and if someone gets sick I won’t know how to cope with it! Hopefully god is looking down and this will clear soon
