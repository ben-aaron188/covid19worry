I originally was very unworried about the situation and felt that the media was behaving irresponsibly and scare mongering. I still believe that the media has reported the situation very poorly but now understand that this is s very serious situation. I am handling isolation well and me and my family are enjoying the extra time with each other. The children are coping really well with the change even though it is clearly a very confusing and challenging time for them. We are managing to home school them without it feeling stressful or difficult and I feel like the children are actually benefiting a great deal from the situation
