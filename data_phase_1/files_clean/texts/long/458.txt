I feel hopeful for the future of humans, more so than I ever have before. As terrible as the situation is, I've witnessed people come together and support each other and be motivated to make changes they were unwilling to make before.

I definitely see this as an opportunity for humanity to review what we're doing wrong (as well as what we are doing right), reflect on how we act as a species and change our ways to improve the lives for ourselves and future generations.

I think that we can use this as an opportunity, both individually and collectively, to better ourselves and in turn better society.
