I feel frustrated as cannot see loved ones who are not in my household. I am worried about my family and friends contracting the virus and becoming seriously I'll from it. I regularly have nightmare about feeling chlostraphobic and loved ones dying which doesnt help. I feel like I need exercise to get me through this, especially with working from home. It is also hard when others around me are all off work being furloughed, but I still need to do my work. I feel like I am becoming obsessed with watching the news. Uneasy, unknown, agitated. Wondering when this will all end
