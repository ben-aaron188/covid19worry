I am upset that I live so far away from my mum.Angry that my husband still has to work. I'm angry that people are not taking the precautions seriously. People are still travelling into Wales for holidays, to caravan parks and holiday homes, to surf and sunbathe. I read an article yesterday about people from Sheffield that were in Bala Wales. Rural areas of Wales have less medical care, less hospital beds, less ventilators. People need to stay in their own areas, in their own homes.I try to watch some news every day but limit my exposure so as to settle my anxiety.
