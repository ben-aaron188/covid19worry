While I can appreciate the anxiety others are experiencing, I don't feel overly worried. I am in the middle of self isolating and will return to work like normal later this week. My job will not massively change. My life hasn't massively changed. My partner is struggling employment-wise but this doesn't worry me much either. A patient I work with was diagnosed with covid and despite many complex physical health needs, has made a full recovery. Infection rates are dropping. I feel quite hopeful at this time.
