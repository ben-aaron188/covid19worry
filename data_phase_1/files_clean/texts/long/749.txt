The current situation is scary for me personally as I have family in vulnerable categories who could become ill with it. I feel pressure to achieve more within my household in terms of activities and chores. I feel safe within my house. I worry for the wider community and the long term effects of this virus I also donâ€™t want to catch it myself . However  It also means I have more time to relax and enjoy quality time with my family and I can concentrate on what is important to me. I am pleased there is clear government instruction to follow and feel comforted that everyone is in the same boat.
