I feel very afraid for my future, the company i work for has lost much of its work and i fear i will be able to keep my job, my home and my life as it was before Coronavirus. It is hard to see how this will come out good for anyone i know currently and i am afraid right now.

The government appears to be doing an okay job hover unless they lift the ban soon then i fear i will lose all i have worked so very hard for and the support offered by the government does not come close to saving us all. Thank you for listening.
