This virus is becoming very serious therefore i am worried, however i am taking the right precautions by staying at home, so i shouldn't be worried about getting the virus. A downside is that i don't get to see my friends or family that don't live with me, it's becoming lonely. I can only hope that everyone listens to the government and stays home so we can beat this virus and lock down can soon be over so we can all get back to our daily lives, especially the people who are out of work right now due to Corona and aren't getting paid.
