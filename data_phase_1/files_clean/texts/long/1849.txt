The uncertainty of this unprecedented situation is deeply worrying. It is the uncertainty that unsettles me the most. How many people will ultimately be affected physically? What will the final mortality number be? What will we be able to learn and ascertain about the virus itself? How will our economy recover? Has anyone thought of the added bill to the NHS for the impending mental health issues this may all cause? It's all just so unknown and the fear of the unknown is the biggest of all. Personally speaking, I feel extremely fortunate to not feel affected though that too may change. My children are thankfully healthy and my parents, too. I was looking after my mother after she sustained a subarachnoid haemorrhage, she was discharged from hospital 3 weeks ago which is unbelievably fortunate timing. We feel very lucky that she managed to get home.
