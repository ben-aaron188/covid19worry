More than anything the uncertainty regarding the length of the quarantine is the most concerning. The situation overall is not that difficult for me personally, but the quarantine began sooner than I expected so I didn't prepare as much as I could have. As a third-year university student, the changes in methods of teaching has taken some time to get used to. The preestablished weekly routine has been disturbed so there is a sense of losing track of time; every day feels alike, and consequently my sleeping habits have worsened. There are broader concerns regarding aspects such as graduation and the unexpected lack of certain resources. The biggest difficult that I have experienced is perhaps the separation from family members as I chose to stay within the university city.
