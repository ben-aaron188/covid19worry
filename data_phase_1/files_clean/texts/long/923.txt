Staying at home has me very lethargic and unmotivated to do anything productive with my time. I very much miss the little things of life like meeting friends and going out which made me happy. I long for this to be over honestly but I know that can only happen with the hard work of our health services and whatnot. However, I am extremely angry at our government's handling of the situation (e.g lack of PPE for frontline staff), I think the lack of preparation was very irresponsible and thus I am a little disgusted by it. Though I feel like this time has brought a big collecive spirit together and I feel like I'm more appreicative of my friends and family.
