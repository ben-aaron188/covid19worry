I am verry worried at the moment...and all over the world it doesn't look any better..i am afraid we we'll be in this situation or worse for months to come....people need to stay indoors but that doesn't happen everywhere ...some don't take it seriously untill it happens to somebody they know...very sad how people don't think...now withe the warmer weather it will be worse..a lot of people think they are imune to the virus...even kids die because of it ...nobody is imune..stay indoors...................................................
