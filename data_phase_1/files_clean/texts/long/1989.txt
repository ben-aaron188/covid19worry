I am in a weird situation with covid19. My partner is on the extremely vulnerable list, so i have had to take 12 weeks leave, so that we can shield lockdown. I have no work to do, but cant go out, or do anything useful. This is the first time in 30 years i have been off work this long. Im very nervous about our situation, as her catching covid19 would likely be fatal for her. Im not bored, and we are having good fun together, but things are hard, as we have to rely on others for shopping and things like that. Its all strange, but we are getting on with things as best we can.
