I’m doing all I can do to keep myself and my partner safe. Distancing and washing hands upon return home. I hope this will be enough to not get covid19. 
I see a long period of social distancing ahead of us to try to minimise the spread. Hold little hope of a global vaccination this year.
I can’t think of anything else to say except the government’s response has been pathetic following 10 years of unhinged Tory ideology.
500 characters for 50p is an absolute joke. I have nothing else to add to this ridiculous demand of my time
