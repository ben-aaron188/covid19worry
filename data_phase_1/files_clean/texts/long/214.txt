I feel anxious about the thought of leaving the house. Whilst I am very careful, I'm worried about others who don't appear to be taking it seriously. There have been too many people taking advantage of perceived loopholes to allow them to do as they wish. I wish they would adhere to the rules and advice so that we can all recover from this quicker and with more of the population alive at the end of it. I also wish that the NHS was better looked after to be able to cope with this. I hope that when this is all done that the NHS and other key workers are paid a better wage that truly reflects their hero status at times of need.
