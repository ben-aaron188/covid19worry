I feel really uncertain about everything that is going on, it is quite scary not knowing when things are going to go back to normal. I am really sad about everything I have had to leave or put on hold during this time. I am anxious about losing my job and not having work. I am really unmotivated to continue my studies during this crisis. I feel more isolated than ever and don't know how I can continue to cope. I am worried for all the people in vulnerable situations and angry at how this situation will be affecting them and the lack of help available
