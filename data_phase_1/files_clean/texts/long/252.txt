I feel anxious about the whole situation. About contracting CV19, about my family contracting CV19, about the economy, about the struggles the NHS and its workers are facing on a daily basis. 

I feel angry that people are flouting the rules when people are giving up so much to stay in. 

I feel worried about the economy and how it will recover and about the stability of my job. 

I feel grateful that I am with my family and we are together and we have food and we have spaces where we can walk without coming in to contact with other people
