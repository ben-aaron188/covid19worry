it is really scary not knowing what will happen, when things will go back to normal. its also worrying as im a single mum to 2 kids with special needs so i cant even go out to shop. kids are missing there nan and uncle and dont understand why we are stuck inside still and how long we will have to remain this way.  my sons birthday is next week and he will have to spend his birthday just stuck at home and its really not fair at all. i will be happy once all of this is over and we can go back to normal
