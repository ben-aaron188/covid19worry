I feel frightened for me and for my family, that if we get it we might get sicker and die. Young nurses dying has worries me - if they can’t survive it how on earth do people have any chance to beat it. I am so fearful for my relatives who have health conditions, that they might get sick and not be offered any treatment because of poor outcomes. I am angry at the people hoarding, at the people socialising and flouting the guidelines. They’re endangering themselves and others and it makes me so mad that they don’t care. I am frustrated with the government, the years of Nhs underfunding. To dismiss the skill of so many for so long and to now want the help of all these long suffering front line staff.
