I feel very sad watching the news and about the people affected by this. I feel worried about my own family's health. I am worried about my financial situation as I am a supply teacher not on a contract so am not getting paid at the moment. It is difficult to sleep. I am worrying about doing a good job home schooling my three children, aged 14, 12 and 7. All these things are making me anxious. I can see some positives I am enjoying spending time with my children not rushing around to work, people coming together and supporting the NHS is a good thing.
