I’m feeling very anxious and scared that either I, my husband or daughter may become ill due to Coronavirus. I’m afraid that despite adhering to all the cleaning and washing and social distancing rules we may still get it.
My husband and I are both key workers with me working in the NHS. I am on annual leave at the moment but am scared that I may catch it at work when I return there next week. It frighten me that there are people younger than me who are in hospitals on ventilators or worse still dying when they were fit and healthy before they caught the virus.
