At the moment I feel guilt for enjoying the isolation, I suffer with social anxiety and sadly, this staying inside has allowed me to regain control of my routine and fall back in love with my hobbies, but in the same vein I'm scared for what's to come when it's all over or even before it is, I'm worried about my family members, my job and when the world will be back to normal. 
Currently my place of employment is closed and as it's a small business there is a good chance it will go under as the local authority isn't supporting them as best they can. I honestly have no idea what life will be when this is all over.
