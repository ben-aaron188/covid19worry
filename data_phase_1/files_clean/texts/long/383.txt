i feel frustrated as everybody has to work together to get out of this but some people just want to look for trouble.

i also feel confused why people are not following the rules and simple instruction or being greedy.

this also makes me worried if UK do not make the situation under control in the next few weeks. there are also constant feed of news that are unbelievable that makes me speechless. 

but all in all i am still grateful for the people that are keeping the society functioning, for example the health workers, people delivering and supermarket workers.
