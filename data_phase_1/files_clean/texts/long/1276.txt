I am terrified of my family being ill.  I feel total despair and cannot see the end of this situation.  I am so sad that I cannot travel as that is my passion.  I watch in horror as Trump spouts his insane ramblings putting peoples lives in danger.  The uk government is just as bad, they want the old and ill to die so they don't have to pay as much in benefits.  The true situation in hospitals is being kept from the public and key workers are being put at risk by not being given the correct protective equipment
