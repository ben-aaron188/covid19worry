Worried. I have symptons - my 14th day with a cough. I should be ok but this disease has a lot of unknowns. I'm better than I was so I am optimistic. I am worried for Boris Johnson our Prime Minister. I also worry about my family though they are fine at the moment. The economy is a worry and I dare not even look at my pension pot for fear how much it has diminished. I fear for the economy in the short and medium term and I feel so sorry for small businesses like garden centres. I am happy that the weather is getting warmer and that I can sit in the garden and also go for a walk and cycle for exercise.
