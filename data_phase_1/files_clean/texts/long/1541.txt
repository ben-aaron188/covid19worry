I feel somewhat fearful of what's to come in the future as I believe that we're not even close to having seen the worst of the coronavirus yet. I am worried for my family, especially my mum who is even more vulnerable to the situation due to having a chronic illness. It makes me angry that some people aren't following the government guidelines of social distancing as this is only going to make matters worse and lengthen the time that this lockdown and virus continues for. I feel that they are being selfish and not taking the situation seriously as they should be. They are not only putting themselves at risk, but also other people.
