I'm very worried about myself or someone I know catching the coronavirus/COVID-19. I am fearful that vulnerable people I know will die as a result needlessly. Irrationally, though I am fit and healthy, I worry that I will suffer greatly or even die if I catch the disease any time soon. I want to stay inside but miss going outside very much. I'm upset with the disruptions it has brought to daily life and I long for normality to return as soon as possible - it's essential that I have a routine for my mental well-being, in my opinion.
