Personally i am mostly anxious about how it is likely to affect my employment, as i am working a fixed term contract that ends in august and I do not expect it to be renewed. I haven't been too worried about the virus itself affecting me or anybody too close to me, as my father is the only person I know who falls into the vulnerable categories, and he seems to be self-isolating reasonably sensibly.

I have been working from home, but I haven't been very productive at all and my boss seems to expect me to be (because i live alone), but i am finding it difficult to concentrate. I think this is mostly because of my isolation rather than fear about the virus directly. I do think that workplaces in general seem to be assuming that if you are working from home and not caring for children, then you should be working at 100% efficiency, but I don't believe that this is realistic.
