I feel irritated that we are even at this point when we knew that it would spread from wuhan because people lack common sense and continued travelling back and forth even after they were advised not to. I'm angry that people still aren't listening even though the rules have been made perfectly clear. I am especially mad at my government for not enforcing more of a lockdown. As someone with depression and anxiety I often have quite a low opinion of other people for their lack of care about others, but it has become worse now that I have been forced to see just how selfish other people really are.
