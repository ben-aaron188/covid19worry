I mostly feel resigned waiting for events to develop. I feel somewhat anxious, but anxiety is not overwhelming. Sometimes I feel lonely and discouraged because everything seems uncertain and nothing seems predictable anymore. Somehow I think I don't feel about the whole situation as much as I should. I think I should be more frightened, or more worried. Instead, I let events pass. I often ask myself whether this is the best way to cope with the situation, or whether I'm just trying not to think about it too much.
