I feel helpless that in reality there's nothing much we can do to stop ourselves getting it.
I am going to the shop in place of my parents to keep them inside and keep them safe, but it doesn't really help because if I get it by going outside I will spread to them as we live in the same house. So you feel like you can't do right from wrong. It makes me worried that my parents could get ill because I know for sure that one of them probably couldn't survive it. I don't think I could cope if they died alone in hospital. I am worried about the future because I feel like there's a very high chance my world could come crashing down in the next couple of months. 
I have started a new job and I want to just be getting on with it normally. I'm also worried because I have no employment protection because I have not been there long enough. Even if I was furloughed I wouldn't be paid because I started after 28 Feb. 
I'm worried about the next stages of my life because I know the economy will be wrecked.
