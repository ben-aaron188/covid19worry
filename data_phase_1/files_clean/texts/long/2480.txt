I'm very sad people are dying, some people are losing their jobs, i'm worried about my job and my finance.

I'm worried i will get sick with the Corona because i'm still working, as i'm not self isolating and i'm in contact with my colleague this is particular worrying for me, we have been told to observe the 2 meters rule but this is impossible to do at my work please, touching surface at work is also very as we share computer keyboards.

I have a lot of anxiety every time i watch the news there's bad news, i need a bit of positivity on telly, I have anxiety about my rent will i be able to afford it next months? 

My mental health is deteriorating, i think it's a mix of not knowing what the future holds and if my saving will last till the Corona situation is over.
