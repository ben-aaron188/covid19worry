I am very anxious, both for myself (as I have underlying health concerns which would make contracting coronavirus more serious, potentially fatal) and for my family. I am also concerned about the financial impact, both personally and for the country, and indeed the world economy. Should I emerge the other side, I will be much worse off financially and many of my plans will have to be changed as they will have become impossible in a more difficult Labour market.

Whilst of secondary importance, it is frustrating to be stuck inside my flat. I fear I might go a bit stir crazy!
