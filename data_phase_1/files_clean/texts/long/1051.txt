I feel really worried and stressed about this whole situation. My job is demanding, i am struggling at home and i am in a bad place. I am not sleeping and my relationships are suffering. I feel anxious all the time and am constantly down.

To top it off i am sad because my cat has gone missing. I feel like my life is going wrong. I don't know how to make it better or get through this. 

My toddler is playing up all the time and my marriage is breaking down too. I never imagined 2020 would be such an awful year.
