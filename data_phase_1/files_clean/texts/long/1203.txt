I am enraged because I can't go on a date.  That is literally the only reason for my anger.  I enjoy using Tinder and I am being prevented!  Furthermore, I can't go to the gym which I would describe as 'irritating'.  I would rather know we were stuck in for six months than have the feeling of the unknown.  Also, as a shop worker I feel that store assistants should be allowed to wear face masks.  Social distancing is one thing, but what about industrial distancing?! I have baked more cakes than normal due to avoiding trips to the shop for biscuits.
