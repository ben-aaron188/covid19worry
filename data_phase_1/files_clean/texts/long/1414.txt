I'm sincerely anxious about how things might transpire. We are nowhere near the resolution of this situation and I see it only getting worse. How will our economies recover? What will change in day to day life? This small little virus has scrambled everything we took for granted, so perhaps we'll emerge as better humans, but I'm not too optimistic about that.

I'm mostly fearful that my mother will catch the virus, she is 75 and has COPD. It would effectively be a death sentence for her as she's already in poor health. We're safeguarding her like the queen!
