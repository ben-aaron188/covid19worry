I feel like the coronavirus situation has escalated much more and much quicker than anyone could have anticipated, and as such we are living in unprecedented times. The fact that it is affecting so much of daily life and that nobody seems sure what to do or what will happen is scary and anxiety inducing. I am worried that people I know and love could die or get very I'll, and worried that it will be a long time before life returns to normal, and by that point we may be unable to financially recover.
