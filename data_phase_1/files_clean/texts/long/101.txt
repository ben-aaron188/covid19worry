I am angry that people wont stay in and everyone who is staying in for there own health so why cant people do what there told. There seems to be certain people that dont think it will affect them even if it doesn't affect them with the virus the longer we are on lockdown the worse the economy will be and we all have to support our family which will make it even harder when this is over!!! Children are missing out on there education which is a massive concern for them and there well-being. I have got relatives that cant go out for the whole 12 weeks because of there health issues and we cant see them thank goodness for facetime, i do feel very relaxed about the situation when you dont listen to the news as i have my family around me doing things together as we have time and arsnt in a rush to get things done, we really feel like this has been a reset button for us and we dont need all the things we buy as you can do without them its just a habbit at the end of the day
