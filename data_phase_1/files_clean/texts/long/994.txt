I am quite anxious about the situation currently as I cannot go and see my mother as she is in a high risk category so all I have been able to do is drop food at her door and wave through the window. I am a key worker and whilst I am working reduced hours, I am still having to work and are therefore more at risk than if I could just stay home. It is annoying when people don’t seem to be paying attention to how they need to stay at home or when greedy business owners decide that there ‘non essential’ business is key.
