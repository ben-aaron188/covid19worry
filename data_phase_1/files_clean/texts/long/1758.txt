Feel quite anxious about the future  and also sad about the number of fatalities. Maybe a bit of anger at those not obeying government directives. And also not pleased about the lack of PPE provision by government for healthcare staff. Overall I also feel hope that this shall pass quick and normalcy restored. I feel blessed to be able to spend more time with family in lockdown. Also wonder if outcome would be different if definite measures were put in place earlier. I feel appreciation for the frontline health workers and all other essential staff,
