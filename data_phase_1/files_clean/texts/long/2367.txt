I’m very anxious about the situation. Boris has just been sent into intenseive care which has worried me more. I hate not having a normal life. I hate being stuck at home not being able to do my
Job, or go into a coffee shop just because I wanted to. I miss seeing friends and family when I want. It’s all very frustrating. I’m lucky I have a girlfriend and cat I live with, as they are good company. But everything is a lot more intense than they usually would be. I hope things go back to normal sooner rather than later.
