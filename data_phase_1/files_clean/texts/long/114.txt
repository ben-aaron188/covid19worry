Right now, I feel anxious about whats to come and the likelihood of an extended lockdown period. Also, a bit of anger because of available lack of food and long queues due to people's ignorance. I also feel fear of losing a loved one and, catching the virus. I also feel like a lot about the virus and its spread is being hidden from the general public. I also feel confused at times due to the spread of false information (e.g. 5G coronavirus stories). I am student and there has also been an intense pressure on my ability to complete my workload before deadlines.
