For me it's scary. We have to fight with an invisible enemy. At the same moment we have to sacrifice the economy to save people. Many people will die because of situations connected to the virus like clough in the healthcare or economic issues. Closing people at home hits their mental health. Many people are not prepared to spend that much together. Many businesses will go bankrupt. The world as we know now will never come back. I wish people are less reckless and take more seriously this situation. We need to stand together to overcome this issue. I also wish British goverment had reacted faster to the problem.
