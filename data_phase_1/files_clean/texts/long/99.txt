I feel anxious about the whole situation and the consequences it has had. I'm worried that my friends and family may contract the coronavirus especially the older members of my family. My Dad works for the NHS so I worry that he may contract it. I am also sad as I miss work and do not know when I will be allowed to return. I am happy that I can spend time with my immediate family and pets, time I would not usually get to spent as I should be at university. I am anxious about university as the coronavirus has made significant changes to my two exams, my assignment and the support I am receiving. I fear that the coronavirus will have a negative effect on my performance at university.
