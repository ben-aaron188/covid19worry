This is a difficult time for everyone, but do feel the Government should have taken action to stop the virus spreading in the UK sooner and ensured all those in need would have access to the PPE they need. As a family of mainly self-employed people we have no idea when we be allowed back to work and this will cause hardship and debt to many. Although, thankfully, I should be okay. Also, I do not feel we are being told the truth. Only those dying in hospital are included in the figures, thus we are not given a true picture of the scale of the epidemic.
