I am anxious, mainly because I am responsible for a multi-generational household - myself, my 15 year old son (who would have been taking his GCSEs) and my 87 year old father, who has vascular dementia and is very frail. We have carers coming in and out of the house 4 times a day to do Dad's personal care, and I live in fear of one of them inadvertantly (and they do do their best to be careful) bringing the virus in, as I realise it would likely mean a distressing and horrible death for Dad. I'm also worried about the effect of all this on my son, who now cannot improve on his schoolwork in order to get the grades he needs (he was unwell eariler in the year). I'm also worried about income, as I'm self employed and quite affected by the crisis in that regard. On the plus side, it's like someone has pressed the 'pause' button on life, it's peaceful, we are lucky enough to be in a reasonable sized house with a garden, and when I'm not worrying, I'm actually very relaxed, with the lack of rushing here and there.
