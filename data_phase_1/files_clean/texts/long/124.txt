I’m concerned about how long we will remain distanced from our friends and family and normal everyday life. It’s particularly hard going being in lockdown with a 2 year old. I hope people continue to respect the social distancing rules so that the freedom to go out to exercise isn’t ruined for everybody. I think that if that right was taken away from us then I would struggle immensely with the situation. I would feel incredibly trapped and both my mental and physical health and that of my family would suffer.
