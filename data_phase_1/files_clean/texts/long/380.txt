I feel anxious about the lasting economic effect it may have. I'm concerned as student about the difficulties I may face when searching for a job in the future. Other than that  I worry a bit about my relatives and their health, but not as much because I know they are keeping safe and making smart decisions in order to protect themselves.  I don't stress about my well-being as I'm young, healthy and very careful. I also only live with only one other person who isn't vulnerable and has moved out for the time being. I am happy about how empty roads are when I go out on my bike. That's one good side against all the bad.
