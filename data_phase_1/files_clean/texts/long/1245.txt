Total fear and anxiety. Terrified of dying. Terrified of losing another loved one. Scared of being on lockdown for much longer because it's making my mental illness worse. Missing my friends and family. Scared of going out and hyper suspicious of everyone I come across outside when I have to walk my dog. Angry at the people who aren't sticking to the rules. Sick of talking about it. Missing my friends and family painfully. Not sleeping or eating properly due to constant fear and paranoia. Feeling trapped in my home.
