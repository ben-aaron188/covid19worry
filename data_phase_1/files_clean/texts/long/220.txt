At present I am incredibly worried about the COVID-19 situation and very worried about contracting the virus as I am a high risk individual. I am also very sad due to the fact I am unable to see my partner during this time and haven’t done so for 3 weeks now. I am currently unable to go to work due to being high risk which is incredibly frustrating as I am a key worker and as I am currently on statutory sick pay which does not cover my monthly bills. I’m hoping that this pandemic will be over as soon as possible.
