I feel very scared and afraid about myself and my family catching the virus. My anxiety levels are very high at the moment. I stay home with my two children while my partner still goes out to work and I am petrified that he could catch the virus and bring it back to us where we could all become ill. I also know and have read that healthy people with no underlying health issue's are dying from the virus also. I feel lonely and miss my family and social interaction and I think this virus could be around longer than people are expecting which means longer social distancing and not seeing family and doing normal things.
