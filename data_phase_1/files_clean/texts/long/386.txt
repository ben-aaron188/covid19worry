I feel sad because of the negative connotations associated with the virus.
I am not happy about the uncertainty surrounding the containment of the virus.
I am not worried about the ability of the country to bounce back to normality after the outbreak has dissipated.
The true effect of the corona outbreak in the UK is not quantifiable as far less people are being currently tested compared to the number of people who have been exposed to the virus. The most accurate information and statistic pertaining to the UK outbreak is the number of fatalities. It is however saddening to know that UK death statistics have not yet peaked.
