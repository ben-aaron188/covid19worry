i am struggling with not having contact with people as as my mum works at a hospital i am not able to see her at all. i am just very scared at the uncertainty of everything and the not knowing of how long it’s going to last. I also feel the government are being hypocritical as one minute they say every stay inside for 14 days with any symptoms, but then their health MP is around people 7 days after having it. I think boris is doing a good job but it’s hypercritical, also my girlfriends dad is NOT a key worker, he is a construction manager, and is having to go into london every day on the underground from a safe rural area... it just doesn’t make sense and there needs to be a lot more clarity, i feel confused, and distressed
