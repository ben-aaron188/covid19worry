A little nervous but in general okay. The amount of cases in my town are very low, and I am I  good health. I am sticking to the guidelines not seeing friends and family. Only going to work and staying at home. Shopping can be a little stressful as you come in contant with people you dont know. Even with the distancing rules it's difficult to look on shelves. Plus you dont know who touched the items before you. Other than shopping in general people around me stick to distancing guides and everybody in good spirits. Try to keep home a fun place to entertain the family.
