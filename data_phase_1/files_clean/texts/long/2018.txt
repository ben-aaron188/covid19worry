I am annoyed that people aren't taking this as seriously as they should, as it putting vulnerable people in unnecessary danger. I am worried for my family as I am not with them at present, and keeping in touch with them helps a lot with the anxiety. Following the growing situation is very stressful, but it is important to keep updated with what is going on. It is re-assuring when positive news is shown regarding the situation to counteract everything negative. Overall I am generally alarmed and anxious about the current CoVid-19 situation.
