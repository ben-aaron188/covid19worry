i am very worried but not quite as much as last week. Italy and Spain seem to be close to turning the corner so i am hoping we can do the same. I was unhappy to see on the news that there were dozens of people by the river in my part of London over the weekend. staying in is probably the hardest thing for me as i live alone but i did so so these people most of them seed to be couples. so in the poll i said i was 0% angry but i guess i am angry with those people. overall i am optermistc that i will get through this but i am sad that the world wil not be the same again meany shops and bars will never open again and the internet will be a huge part of our lives so even when scocal interaction is back on the cards there will be a lot less of it for ever
