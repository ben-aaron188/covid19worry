Frustration at the situation and how there's no end in sight to anything. It seems without a vaccine there's no way for this to end because our government is not competent enough unlike Germany or South Korea. Anger and resentment at the government for having made the political decision to do all this when other countries handled it better and they had months to prepare and only decided to do something just recently. And anxiety and caution about trying to do basic things like shopping. Everyday I have a mild panic attack about some mild pain or twinge I feel, suddenly worried I'm developing it.
