I feel a lot of anxiety about the virus because you just don't know what's going to happen. I miss my family and not knowing how long we'll be apart adds to the anxiety and makes me upset. Even just doing something as simple as popping to the corner shop is a huge stress now because you're constantly thinking about where the virus could be and how easily you could catch it. Seeing the death toll everyday is scary and reading how it hasn't even reached the peak yet is terrifying. It's hard to adjust to this new life of barely being able to go out.
