More than anything I feel anxious. The current situation in which we're living and the not knowing what is going to happen in the future is very anxiety provoking. I am annoyed that the government took so long to enforce social restrictions and lockdown procedures, especially because we could see how severe the disease was becoming in other countries. Even considering trying to develop 'herd immunity' was a selfish bid to protect the econonmy over the health of our people. It lead to a delay in us entering lockdown which I fear will have significant consequences that will be highlighted in the total number of infections and deaths. Excuse my language but: #FuckBoris.
