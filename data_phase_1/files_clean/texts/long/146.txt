I mostly feel frustrated about the Corona situation. Frustrated that the country is in lockdown, frustrated that a lot of people are choosing to disobey the rules and therefore making things worse, frustrated I am stuck at home and unable to do the the things that I enjoy. It is also rather unnerving going through a situation that affects the whole world, but that we have never experienced before. This means that a lot of countries are having to try various methods to suppress the outbreak and there is not one tried and tested method, which is worrying.
