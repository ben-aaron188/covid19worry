In this very moment I am flipping between two sides of emotions. On one side, I have cleaned my house so my environment to work from is really nice and I have spent the day in the sun. This is genuinely nice. On the other hand, I am fearful for my loved ones and my sick relatives and my relatives at risk. This fear grips me. I am angry in anticipation that they get sick and I cannot say goodbye. I am anxious they will stay healthy, to the point where I EXPECT one of my relatives to get sick (most of us are at-risk because of health conditions) and this expectation makes me feel sick with worry.
