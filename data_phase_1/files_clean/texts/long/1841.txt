I am worried for my families safety and whether others will follow precautions.
I believe there are a lot infected then we are lead on to believe.
We need to all quarantine and let it pass

I am concerned for my family in africa who will not have the same safety that I do here

I do not fear death. But I do not want to die this way. I do not want to leave my family behind!

The government is not doing enough to enforce the quarantine and as a result more people are dying from people negligence it is enfuriating
