Awful situation, I feel annoyed with the Chinese government who suppressed a Doctor in Wuhan who was attempted to warn people of the situation.
I feel infuriated with how Borris proudly claimed how he would shake everyone's hands, even boasted shaking hands with people in a hospital which had Corona virus patients - His ignorance may have infected parliament, but also been a sign to people not to worry when in reality we should have been preparing earlier on.
And I'm worried due to elderly members of my family possibly contracting the virus and that finishing them off.
