I am starting to think we are coming out of this now.  The chances of anyone close to me getting it are slim as everyone I know has been so careful about isolating and social distancing.  I was definitely more worried last week but the figures today are going down.  I am suffering from a very bad rash in my neck which is causing me discomfort so I just want everywhere to get back to normal so I can sort it out.  I am worried about the economic side of it and are just thankful that we are lucky to have jobs.
