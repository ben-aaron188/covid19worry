I am easily distracted. As soon as I can focus on something I hear something on the news and I'm right back to feeling anxious.
My job is at risk so I'm worried about my financial situation.
I'm worried about friends and family.
I live by myself and I'm quite lonely.
I'm concerned about all the incredible people helping others. Everytime we hear about another healthcare worker who has died it makes me feel physically sick.
I can't wait for things to get back to normal, but I'm also not sure what normal is now. 
5000+ families in this country forever changed.
I'm finding joy in the smallest of human interactions - thankfully mainly through the internet. I just miss my actual favourite people and want to see them and hug them rather than just see their faces on facetime. 
I'm really really scared that someone I know and love will catch this horrible illness and die.
