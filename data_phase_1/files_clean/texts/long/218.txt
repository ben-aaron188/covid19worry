It is a very strange situation and the social isolation is starting to affect everyone. I am having difficulties adjusting to this new way of life and it makes me wishful and impatient. I am not feeling scared or very worried, although my heart goes out for the people affected.
I think it is more difficult for the elderly as they are not so used to using technology in their every day life. But young people are feeling it as well.
When you go for a walk, there is this new phenomenon called ""The corona virus greeting"" - everybody steps away from each other and then smiles.
