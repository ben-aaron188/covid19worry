The current situation regarding COVID 19 in the United Kingdom is worrying. I personally find myself being unable to sleep at night due to the fear of the contagious virus. I have feel this virus will be resolved in the future therefore I feel slightly at ease. I have felt a little depressed as having to stay in takes its toll. The mood within our household is getting increasing angry as family member are stepping on each other toes which gives me extreme anxiety. Whilst we watch the news slight fear kicks in until we hear something positive then we adjust slightly. I am angry at all the individuals stock Pilling I feel worried for elderly residents in the neighbourhood.
