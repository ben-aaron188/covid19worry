At the moment I feel anxious about going out for my food shopping, making sure I am careful I’m anxious about seeing other people around not obeying the instructions. I feel worried if I were to bring the virus back to my home and my childen. But I’m happy that we are all safe together and enjoying some quality time together. unfortunately we can’t see our extended family for now bit it is the best thing to do for us and the country. I hope that the people not listening to instruction will soon.
