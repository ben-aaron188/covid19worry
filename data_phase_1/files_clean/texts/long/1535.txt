The situation is daunting. I worry about my parents and elderly family members a lot. However, everyday I remain more hopeful that the end is nearer and we’re going to come out of this as a stronger nation. I have been able to find the most positive parts of isolation and have used it to take some much needed relaxation - by spending time with my family and making the most of my daily exercise. I remain hopeful that we’re going to push through this, and I’m thankful for my health, and my family’s health.
