Just heard that Boris Johnson has been admitted to ICU. Even before that it was scary enough. My son sufffers with asthma so I worry that he will get it severely due to his asthma. My mum is 76 in a couple of months and isolating since about 3 weeks. I fetch food for her and worry I might pass it to her. My lovely neighbours work at the local hospital and may be in danger themselves. 
I feel extremely anxious and fearful. I find it hard to concentrate and focus although I feel better when I do as it’s a break from worrying, I don’t sleep well anyway but I wake constantly with a sick knot of fear about what will happen the next day. There are still moments of joy and happiness and pride when I see some of the nice things people do to support each other and I try to do my bit to cheer up others. I also feel shame at the behaviour of the minority when so many are giving their all to care for those sick and suffering.
