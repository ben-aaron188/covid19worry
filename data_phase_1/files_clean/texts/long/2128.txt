I feel very anxious. I am in an at risk group and I can't leave my house for 12 weeks. I can't see my family and miss them terribly. It just feels at the moment that this is never going to end and the people still going out, sunbathing etc aren't helping and are making me angry. Above all, I just need to make sure that I don't get it as this could end up killing me. It gets more worrying every day with all of the deaths being announced. I am angry with China for causing this mess in the first place.
