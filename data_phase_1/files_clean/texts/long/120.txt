I'm personally not bothered or affected by this at all. I'm not saying the virus isn't serious or harmful, but for those people who aren't classed as vulnerable, I still think there's a lot of overreaction and unnecessary panic. This pandemic also shows how selfish, ignorant and bone idol the British public are as it's clearly too much for them to be able to follow a simple set of rules. It's not like we're going to war, you're being told to stay at home and watch TV. Obviously people don't like their freedom taken away from them but this must be one of the easiest rules in history to follow.
