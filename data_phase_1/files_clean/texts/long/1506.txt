I’m concerned about how the rate of deaths is increasing day by day, and it seems that we have not yet reached the peak. This feeling isn’t helped by the fact that I still have to go into work in a large office with many other people, therefore increasing my exposure risk. I’m frustrated by people ignoring the guidelines set out by the government as it’s just going to end up penalising us all. That said, the government could do more to combat this by enforcing stricter rules. I’m also feeling lonely. I would say that I can be quite introverted and do enjoy time to myself at home, and I don’t much like physical contact from friends or family. But this is often the way because it’s what I decide and being told that I can’t just pop round my friend’s for a cup of tea, or hug my parents is quite isolating.
