At the moment i am a strange mix between fearfull and weird.I just do not know what to think as although i am not bothered about getting covid 19 myself,i am more bothered about spreading the disease.Lockdown is not very much different for us,only the food prices have gone up with no shop branded stuff.We are struggling financially as i am disabled and on a low fixed income.We have hids at home as well so not them getting freee school dinners does not help.My feelings with coronavirus and my kids are that i hope either me or my partner passes it to them or they do not get it themselves.
