Concerned about the economic impact for myself and the country. Worried that front line NHS staff are being put at risk due to a lack of PPE or planning. 
Sadness that the world will go back to how it was before, forgetting about how we could change for the better as a result of this pandemic. 
Fearful that lessons will not be learned and that the destruction and damage to the environment will continue resulting in many more globally damaging events. 
Concerned that a drive towards a carbon neutral world will pushed aside as country's try to rebuild and use this as an excuse not to drive forward these initiatives.
