I am very anxious about the whole situation.
The Chinese need to spill the beans as they are obviously not telling us all the information.
There is certainly more to this 
I will lose my job and it will be hard to get another at my age .
The shopping is also a major stress . I have to do it for 4 neighbors as well as ours . This means several trips to the supermarket putting my self at risk .
It’s all ver surreal. I’m not sure we Will get through it all intact . Not interacting with the human race is not good for mental health
