I feel that the Corona situation has brought a lot of upheaval to people's lives as they adapt to social distancing measures and get used to the changes in their daily lives. It has also brought communities and people together as they selflessly help each other through the pandemic. I feel that people will learn a lot once the pandemic is over such as appreciating their freedom and valuing the service provided by workers in the NHS. I think in the future the world will be better prepared in the event that another pandemic arrives.
