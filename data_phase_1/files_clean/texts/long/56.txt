I was relaxed until starting this survey. My anxiety started to heighten as I though more about it. I am worried as to how long it'll last. I am fearful for the future but not so much fearful in the present, my thoughts are moving into the future though. things like money and travel are worrying me. The uncertainty around the whole situation is fustrating but i understand the unease around it. It could not have arrived at a worse time to be honest. I am nervous to see how extended family will cope, especially as isolation is very bad for your mental health
