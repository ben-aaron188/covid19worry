Lockdown has to happen for another few months yet and I'm prepared for that and just hoping the idiocy of the few don't spoil it for the rest of us and it becomes a total lockdown like in spain. I don't think the government has done enough and should have gave everyone a basic income so that the economy wouldn't suffer as much and the poorest aren't worse off than the ones who get 80% of their income paid. 

We will not forgive or forget these selfish people who have stockpiled and flauted the rules regardijng social distancing either
