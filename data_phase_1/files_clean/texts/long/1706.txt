I feel like this is probably the peak of the virus and that new cases and death numbers will hopefully start to go down. I'm not concerned about myself catching the virus but I'm worried that an elderly member of my family could catch it. I'm hoping that most people can get back to work soon as people because people could start to run out of money soon. I'm wondering how this is going to affect the economy around the world and I'm wondering when the barber shop will re-open as I really need a haircut.
