I am worried about the situation as a vulnerable person and I am very anxious about what could happen it I caught the virus. I am angry with those not taking the virus seriously and are behaving selfishly. I believe this is largely the result of the misconception that this virus will only effect the elderly and vulnerable people. I am disappointed with the government for not taking action sooner and for continuing to have a lenient attitude to lockdown. The public are not taking the measure seriously enough and I feel they will only do so when the governments puts stricter measures in place. It makes me fearful that the actions of others are only going to make the situation worse. This situation is very unsettling for everyone and I think everyone needs to come together at this time and protect each other.
