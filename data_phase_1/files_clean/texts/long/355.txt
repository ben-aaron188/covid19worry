I am annoyed at the blase and irresponsible attitude of everyone else not social distancing when others are doing their part. It shows the true selfishness of the human race.
I am concerned for the vulnerable people close to me and how they might be affected by coronavirus. I am scared for them if they come into contact with anyone with the virus as I don't think they will cope well with it.
I feel sadness as I am missing seeing my family and friends with all the social distancing going on. Although I am hoping that it will be over soon.
I am thankful that I live in the UK where PPE, healthcare etc are not an issue for our population, unlike some other countries such as America.
