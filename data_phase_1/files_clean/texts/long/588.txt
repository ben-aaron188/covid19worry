I feel anxious about it everyday. I pray to calm myself as that helps. Everytime I feel any type of symptom, I get very worried and stressed out. I get anxious everytime I read the papers or watch the news and being indoors indefinitely gives me alot of anxiety. My daughter is tired of being home too and I feel sorry for her. Going food shopping or for any essentials makes me nervous as I worry about the people I am coming in contact with. Being outside, even in the open air, gives me serious anxiety because I fear the virus may be in the air. Sounds crazy but isolation will do that to you. It is just a very trying time. Thankfully, I'm working from home and even as challenging as it has been, I am grateful for something to keep me busy and to still be earning.
