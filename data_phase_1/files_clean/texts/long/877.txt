I feel calm and united with other people, because it seems like the situation has been taken into control and it is only a matter of time when it gets resolved. At times, I feel like there is a lot of disinformation from media which manipulates the general public. I feel sorry for the people who get in that trap. 

Other than that, the governments have demonstrated serious intentions to win over the pandemics with the real actions, and this definitely helps me feel at peace. I feel optimistic about the future, however, I also clearly understand about the economic damage we will have to suffer as the result of this pandemic.
