I am very anxious about the virus. I am worried about contracting it or passing it to someone else who is vulnerable in my family . I am hoping that the lock down measures in place will start to show a slower spread of the virus.  I am concerned and dismayed that the government in my country did not learn from other countries that had a larger outbreak sooner and impost lock down measures as soon as possible. I feel sad when I hear about the amount of lives the virus has taken already and at the daily rate in my country. I am trying to stay as relaxed as possible but it is hard when we see the news.
