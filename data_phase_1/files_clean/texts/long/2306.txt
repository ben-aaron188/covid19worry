At the very moment i feel very restricted and without much to do. although i do appreciate the fact that i get to spend a lot more time with my family and talk and do other stuff we put of as there was no time, but there is a lot of time left for that now. Also, with the whole lock down situation which i completely understand and support to reduce spreading is making sure a lot of people have no jobs and cannot really go out or do anything socially. i also find that there is a bit of confusion and not knowing as i do not know when the situation will improve and when the lock down gets removed etc.
