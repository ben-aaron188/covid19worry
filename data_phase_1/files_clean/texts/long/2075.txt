I feel that in general some people are making it worse for everyone else. Also, the media has been awful and made everything worse.

They spread lies and they are as bad as social media with the false information going around.

People don't seem to understand the social distancing methods, i have even walked down a path to get essentials and two police have walked passed me next to each other when they could have just walked in single file down the small path. People in general are idiots here in the uk, sunbathing in parks and not taking the issues seriously.
