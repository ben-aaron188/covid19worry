I feel hopeful for what the future holds, currently the situation is not very good and I feel very sorry for everyone affected, We need to realise this is a small blip in our lives and we can get through this. The majority of people are sensible but the few who are breaking rules continue to extend the length of the lock down we have. Everything will be okay in the end but the catastrophic consequences of how poorly this disease has been managed has resulted in lots of unnecessary suffering. We will come out stronger
