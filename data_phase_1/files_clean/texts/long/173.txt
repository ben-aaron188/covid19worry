 Am just as worried about it the same as the next person.I'm feeling quite upbeat today as been doing indoor crafts with kids but its always in the back of my mind.
   I have elderly parent's(in 80s) and my inlaws are in their 60's and all have underlying conditions.
  I myself have Asthma so it is a worrying time.We all need to accept that we will know someone who will pass away.
   I am trying to keep the kids happy and occuped as they do understand but their routine is shot to pieces.They have been doing schoolwork but as this is now Easter holidays they dont have any.
  Even thous its not life as we know it,I still feel that we should have total lockdown.
