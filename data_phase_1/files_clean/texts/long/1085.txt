I feel anxious as my partner and I have neurological conditions and know there is some risk but there is such a lack of information about how at risk or what to look out for that it is scary. Iâ€™m also concerned about my loved ones. Nearly every couple I am close to has at least one person who is at risk of severe complications. I also know that my health problems started after having glandular fever and how a virus can cause complex lasting problems. So even if the death toll is not as high as expected, I worry about the long term health complications that may come to follow.
