I have never felt to anxious ever. I suffer with mild anxiety but nothing major. I had my first ever panic attack. It was awful. I’m currently a university student and am I’m my final year so this all happening now has really hit me. I miss my friends, boyfriend and other family members. I can’t wait for things to go back to normal cause I don’t know how long I can take this. My nan and granddad are stuck in complete lockdown in Cyprus and that upsets me everyday. I just want to go out there and see them. My boyfriend is currently home from uni and all I want to do is see him but we can’t. We miss each other so much but it’s too risky to see each due to him having his nan live with him. We also have a holiday booked in June which I was so looking forward to, I’m honestly gutted. I keep looking at what I was doing last year and I was just a more happy person
