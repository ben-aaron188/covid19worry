Im very worried as I have heart failure and am isolating with my wife and kids.Im terrified of getting it as Im not sure if my health would cope.I get angry when I see people not sticking to the rules.
Overall I will do what Im told to survive this.
I also worry for people who have to face this virus on a daily basis,they are proper heroes who deserve the utmost respect and should be rewarded for their bravery.I think people might start to think differently about whats important in life.Material things have  taken over peoples lives which is a bad thing.
