Very anxious about my situation and what will happen in the coming months. All the older people dying is heartbreaking and it’s scary that anyone can get infected without even knowing. The governments response has been very slow, and very sad to see them take so much time to implement any measures. People are barely even listening and it’s all too much to handle . I’m not sure if we are going to make it as a whole. I pray we do and find solutions to help everyone both I’ll and those affected financially and losing loved ones
