I'm a mixed jumble. My husband has CF, diabetes and has had a double-lung transplant. We're are shielding together. I know that if we remain indoors we have a hopeful chance. If he catches it he is unlikely to recover from being ventilated. Whether we escape the novel corona virus or not we are still likely to lose our home. This all feels quite suffocating. I'm not ready to lose him. This is going to last for a good 18 months, I have no idea what our future looks like. This is my initial, honest, and unedited response from the top of my thoughts.
