I feel really conflicted - on the one hand I am worried about my parents and how my family would manage if I got ill. But in a very strange way, I am enjoying certain aspects of lockdown. Life is simpler, we are being kinder to one another. We have more time for domestic things. But then I feel guilty, knowing that I only feel this way because my life is quite privileged - how different it would be as a single mother living hand-to-mouth. I worry about how we can begin to resume life and about the people for which it will never be the same.
