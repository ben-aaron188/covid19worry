Everyday I am checking news websites for updates on the coronavirus and checking my local area. I am quite worried, mainly for my parents who are a bit elderly and other family members who are vulnerable. The main feeling I experience now is anxiety and uncertainty about the future and how long this situation will go on for. Other feelings that come to mind also include frustration and anger at hearing about people who break lockdown rules. I feel that my life is on hold as i'm sure most other people do as well, and I just hope that we can find a solution to this sooner rather than later.
