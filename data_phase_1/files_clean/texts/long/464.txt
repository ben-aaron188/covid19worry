I cannot sleep. I'm anxious, my depression worsened. I feel like I'm scared of anything. I'm scared to die. This feeling of uncertainty is eating me alive. I'm scared for my child and my husband who is a key worker. It's unbearable. I feel like I'm barely surviving. I try to stay focused but it's impossible. I feel like we will not have a normal life again. I easily cry after I read the news. I don't want to end up like Italy and I miss being outside. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
