It’s scary and is making me very anxious. I am worried for my family and my friends. I’m also concerned that a lot of people aren’t following the government guidelines and aren’t taking things seriously. I just want it all over and for life to go back to normal. I really miss seeing my mum and I know she is missing her grandchildren. Life has completely changed and the uncertainty is worrying. I’m currently on maternity leave and this situation is making me worry that I’ll have no job to return to in July. It’s scary, disconcerting and worrying.
