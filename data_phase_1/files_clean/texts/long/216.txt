I feel anxious about my family and friends safety. I also feel on edge, worrying about forgetting to wash my hands, or walking too close to a stranger on daily exercise. I am concerned our exercise time will be removed. I am sad about all the people who have died, and also those that have lost their jobs and livelihoods. I have respect for all the NHS, shop workers, carers etc who continue to work to keep us all safe. I miss my colleagues at work, but feel lucky I am still receiving full pay and can work from home.
