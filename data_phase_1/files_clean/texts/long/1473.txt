Really scary and keeping away from loveones and it’s getting really bad day by day. Role should have prepared for something like this rather than looking for driverless cars or try and living in mars. We have started loosing great people from our life’s and governments are lost their control of countries and this has overtaken the whole world. People needs to invest more money on health sector and researches to face these kind of disease and viruses and save human and animals from this world. Nature has shown us no human can stop what nature can do and ultimately nature will decide what and how we need to live.
