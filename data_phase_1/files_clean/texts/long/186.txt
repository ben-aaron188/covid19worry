I am feeling a mix of different emotions. I am worried about my loved ones and saddened by the amount of people who have already passed away. I am angry with people who do not take social distancing seriously as they may be a threat to themselves and people who are more vulnerable due to age or other health issues. I believe our government should be more strict and I am angry that self-isolation was introduced so late in the UK. However, I am glad to be in self isolation with my partner and child otherwise i would be very anxious about their well being.
