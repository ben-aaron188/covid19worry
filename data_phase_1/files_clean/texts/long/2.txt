I’m deeply concerned about the affect of the Coronavirus not just on those I know but my country as a whole. This situation has shown some as truly selfish beings and others as the kindest of kind. It’s also not just the health implications but the financial and mental implications that scare me. I am currently awaiting confirmation from work that they will furlough me due to no childcare to allow me to work. If they won’t furlough me I will be on zero pay and I’m a single parent. Even with a slight top up to my universal credit I will still be hundreds down each month.
