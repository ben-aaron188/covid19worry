I feel lonely at the moment and stressed about all the work I need to get done amid the coronavirus pandemic. I wish we could all be a little kinder with each other and recognize the struggles of having to adjust to this complex situation. I would like to return to my permanent address so that I can interact with my family while practicing social distancing policies. Instead, I am lonely at home and not many people have reached out to check on me. I hope I feel better soon and that I can take a more optimistic view about this current situation.
