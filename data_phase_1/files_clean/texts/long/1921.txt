I feel saddened that this situation has risen and the UK government are not doing very well with dealing such a situation. I feel better than I have felt earlier as I hope soon we will be on a good path to less deaths and infections occurring. I feel angry that things took ages at the start and it was covered in china and not told till dec 2019 and this could all have been prevented in europe a lot sooner without escalating. I am hoping in 3-6 months it can be in the past and we can all move forward.
