I feel sad when looking at the death statistics coming from the most impacted regions, and seeing how people are struggling due to the economic impacts of the virus. 

I feel sad knowing that people can be quite selfish and this first wave of the virus is just the start, and I think that a second wave is very likely as people rush back to their normal lives without considering others. 

I feel angry at the way some parts of the media have treated this situation, as a reason to report and get views rather than acting responsibly. The situation of lockdown in Italy was leaked by the media and that resulted in a lot of panic in the country. I feel the media is responsible for a lot of infections and potentially deaths as a result.
