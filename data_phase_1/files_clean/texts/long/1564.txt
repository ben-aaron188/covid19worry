I feel  and think this is a con.  I have no doubt that the virus exists- however it came to be, and that it APPEARS to affect more people at the same. time in an extreme version of the flu.  I know that,  according to  reputable international organisations such as WHO, under 7000,000 people die during the flu season each winter.  I haven't seen or heard of any of these people who are so ill, nor have my friends and contacts, nor theirs throughout the UK.  I could go on but I feel angry and partly scared at what feels like theatre for an unknown purpose.
