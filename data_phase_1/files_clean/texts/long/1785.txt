I feel the situation has escalated due to the government acting slowly on information that was available in January but ignored, as a result we now have unnecessary deaths and illnesses to a large % of people. If this was acted upon at the time I feel we could have prevented the scale of this and reduced the effect it has had on the economy with workers being made redundant. As a result people are now scared and nervous to even leave the house, and everyone panic buying, leaving a number of people struggling to get basic supplies.
