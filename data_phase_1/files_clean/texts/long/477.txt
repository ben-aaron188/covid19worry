At the moment i feel quite sad and anxious. Sadness because this illness is causing a lot of death and anxious as I do not know what the future holds with both the virus and the economy as I can see this being something that effects us for years to come. I also feel sad as being in a lot is hard and this has caused a lot of exciting events planned to be cancelled.

The only positive about the situation is working from home is less stressful so it means I feel a bit more relaxed however am still hoping this will be over as soon as possible.
