I feel as though the situation is becoming worse and I fear for my families safety should one of them contract it. I worry about my financial safety in terms of paying rent and finding a job after. I am optimistic though that it should get sorted out sooner rather than later and that life should start returnign to normalacy sometime down the line. I feel isolated and cut off, but have not quite reached a point of frustration just yet. I worry that my summer and quality of life shall be affected and I am very wishful that the sitatution improves enough to be able to enjoy the summer time.
