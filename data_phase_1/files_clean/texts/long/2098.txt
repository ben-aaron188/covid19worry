I am very worried as my boss won't close the shop where I work with him, his family and a few delivery people. he's almost 70 so there's a big risk in me being there, considering I live with housemates and we don't know who could be sick and asymptomatic. I'm scared both for him and for myself, but I have a day off today before working the whole week. I hope that his kids either convince him to close or he takes more safety measures. Also I'm in Wales right now and I really miss my family in Poland, especially since most of my friends left to see their family. Im glad that they're safe, though, and I appreciate some time for myself off university
