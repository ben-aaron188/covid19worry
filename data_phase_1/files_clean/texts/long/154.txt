very stressed my daughter has severe asthma so on 12 week  vulnerable people lock down.i spent 35 minutes Friday queuing at chemist for meds that weren't there and 90 minutes today although people weren't close together there was a lot of people and I only live in a village! ive also had to take cat to emergency vet twice and go to local shop for supplies once.im hoping that as I used hand sanitiser tried to keep safe distance from people and washed hands when got home I haven't brought the virus home wont forgive myself if my daughter catches it because of me going out.
