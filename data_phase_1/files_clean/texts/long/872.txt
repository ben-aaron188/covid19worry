currently i am remaining very calm and attempting to reduce anxiety for myself and those i live with. Although i do have some fear that i, or my loved ones could be infected, looking out for my mental health is also important. I definitely understand the severity of the pandemic and i don't think i am making light of it but ultimately i can only do so much, and i remain hopeful that the health service and the rest of the population prevail and we will get through this together. I feel like some people are getting very angry at others for their behaviour, and tensions between individuals have definitely grown in these hard times yet i see this as stupid and immature behaviour, remaining calm is such an important element.
