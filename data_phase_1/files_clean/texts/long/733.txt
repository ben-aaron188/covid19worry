I suffer with anxiety and feel that the current situation has made this 100% worse. It feels like it isn't going to end anytime soon and that concerns me as I miss seeing my friends and family. It upsets me that some people are still acting like nothing is wrong and are going about their daily business, this is only going to draw the process out for a longer time. I avoid watching the news as it is all negative and upsets me. I worry about my mum as she works for the NHS and is still having to do home visits. I also worry about both my nan's as they are feeling very lonely at this present time.
