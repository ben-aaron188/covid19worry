Currently feeling very claustrophobic and restless being confined to the house. 
1 hours exercise/leaving the house a day does not seem to cut the feeling of groundhog day and sitting around to go to bed and do the same again the next day. 
Grateful that I am still able to be paid and I will still have job to go back to after this (work in Dentistry) In normal circumstances I would enjoy the time off work and having the chill time but very sad that cannot be around family and friends, and the anxiety of how long this is going to go on for.
