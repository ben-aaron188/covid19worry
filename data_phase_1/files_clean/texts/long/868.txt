At the moment I am quite anxious about the whole situation, it’s hard to understand what’s going on when there are so many conflicting ideas around it and how dangerous it is or the realism of figures. I’m scared for my family and close friends, and it instills a fear into you whenever they report symptoms as now everyone is thinking that any symptom they get is coronavirus. I am confused about the figures, because social media and news outlets are showing them to be misleading in some aspects, so I feel like I’m in the dark as well as everyone else about whether coronavirus is actually as bad as people are saying. However at this current moment, I am hopeful because today’s figures have shown a decrease in the jump compared to previous days.
