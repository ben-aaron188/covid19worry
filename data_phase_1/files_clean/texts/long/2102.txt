Incredibly nervous about the future. Anxiety is very high. Trying to enjoy the small things, the time and turning negatives into positives. Also using my time to plan new ventures coming out the other side to focus and curb anxiety. 

I feel like we are living in some sort of nightmare and it is terrifying. It is the unknown that is the scariest part, not knowing what the outcome will be, living in fear that we may get it and die but also worrying about how we are going to pay for food and bills due to current self employment.
