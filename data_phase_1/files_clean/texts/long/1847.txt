I feel sad that our freedoms are curtailed, but also know it's for the best long term.  I feel that all the working from home and changes to living standards might help to slightly reform our society for the better when this is done - I look forward to that happening.  I also think the world is realising (as a result of the virus) that we share the planet with each other and with nature, in particular I'm loving how nature is reappearing in places all over the world.  I try and look forward to events I have planned further down the year - but remain nervous that these might also get cancelled each passing week.  I miss my friends and social experiences - especially heading out together and going for runs together.

I support our governments approach - appreciating they've had a very tough line to tread between economic collapse and public health.  It's economic collapse that actually worries me more than the virus itself - that will last far longer than a few months of lockdown!!!  If that can be averted, potentially at the cost of a marginally worse public health outcome, I feel the country would be happier on the whole in the long run.  (Sorry that's a bit of an extreme view I know!)
