I am feeling so angry at how this started and how it spread.It is devastating what is happening to people and families out there.

I know that if everyone can do what the PM says we can beat the virus and save lives. 

We all need to work together as if we were one team and do our bit for ourselves and the country as a whole.

NHS and all the key workers have done a fantastic job workking day and night to ensure they save lives. Also the supermarkets need special praise

Just wish it could end soon
