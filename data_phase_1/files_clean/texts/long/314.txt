There is a lot of misinformation in social media and people believe it which is very frustrating, if people were more educated and properly understood and didn't believe this false information we would be in a much better position. The stay home guidance is effective in some areas but there are too many people flouting this for reasons not defined as exceptions and just leading their normal lives without realising they are going to make this worse for everyone with their selfish behaviour. I am concerned as I am severe risk if I catch COVID-19 and I am therefore taking all precautions I have to but simple things like getting an online delivery is challenging, supermarkets still say I haven't been recognised as vulnerable even though I have had letters and texts saying I am. I understand this is unprecedented but I do feel it could still be handled better.
