I worry about my financial situation, especially concerning student accommodation rents that are due and loans as well as the lack of work and employment out there at this time. I also worry for my family, friends and loved ones. As i have no real way of earning any money, I have incipient and increasingly worrying thoughts about the future at university. although one an say the world is paused which is nice, however at the same time its difficult as there is a tangible disconnection with people.
