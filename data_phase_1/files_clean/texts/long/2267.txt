Sad about the people impacted (health wise and personal situation ie money, job security etc) Unsure if the government have acted clearly. Angry at Chinese markets. Annoyed that front line workers may not have the correct equipment needed to keep them safe. I hope that people in high up jobs and positions will have more respect for lower paid and unskilled workers after this as they are the people helping those affected, health wise or keeping the shelves stocked. Afraid for older and vulnerable members of my family.
