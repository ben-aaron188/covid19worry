That a lot of people within the uk are currently not taking it seriously, for instance people are still going round to other people's houses and meeting up at parks and commons.
Fairly worried for the elderly members of my family and all elderly people in general.
Never experienced anything like this in my life. It is almost like we are in a war time scenario and it would be a lot easier if everyone would adhear to the government so that it will be over quicker.
It is quite upsetting not being able to see my family and friends at the moment but know that this is needed to get over the virus.
Also, it will have a negative impact on the economy and think it will force it into a recession.
