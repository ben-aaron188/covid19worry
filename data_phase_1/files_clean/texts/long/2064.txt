I am very anxious about Coronavirus. I am scared and anxious that I will get it and die because the news keeps talking about young people dying. Every time I have a slight tickle in my throat or cough I think I have got it. I am worried about my financial situation as my partner cannot longer work and we also have a young daughter and I am worried about her too. I don’t want my daughter to be left without parents. She doesn’t understand what is going on and it’s hard to explain because she’s only two so she doesn’t know why she can’t see her family members that she loves.
