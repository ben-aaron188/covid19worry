Since the corona situation, I've been feeling down and more lazier than usual. I'm worried because I have older parents and I'm concered that I will spread the virus to them if I get it. I'm sad because I am not able to be at college to do my work, I am not able to see my wonderful teachers and friends, it is my last year at college so I will probably never see them again. Only one good outcome of this is less people on the streets, it is almost empty. In London, streets would usually be overcrowded which is not good for anti social people like me, but now I can go wonder and get essential items without much people gathering.
