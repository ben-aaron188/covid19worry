I feel sad for those who have lost loved ones, who are feeling alone or whose lives have been very disrupted. Also, I feel very much for those in financial difficulties or without essential support systems available to them.

I feel extremely angry that the Government did not act sooner and that they continue not to be moving quickly enough on testing.

I feel desperate for those countries with inadequate healthcare systems.

I feel angry at the levels of inequality in this country, which continue to be felt through this crisis and have left our public healthcare system on its knees.

For myself though, having recovered from what I think was Covid-19 (a test would have been nice) and with (at the moment and hopefully continuing) well family/friends, I find myself able to make the most that this period of lockdown presents. I am eating better than ever, exercising daily and have time away from a job that I realise causes me stress. I live alone but am regularly in touch with family/friends by telephone and online. I am actually, in many ways, less lonely than normal. Plus, I am desperately pleased for the potential this period offers for the planet to heal itself a little. I love the city without cars: the air is clear and breathable, noise pollution from traffic outside my flat is down. And I like the simplicity and relaxed pace of this life: shopping infrequently and only for essentials; time to plan meals, time to exercise and time just to be.

I would not wish for this - the world should have been better prepared - but being better prepared means living more healthily, sustainably and fairly. I hope we are able to learn the lessons this tragic time has offered us.
