Significant Anger and disappointment that we are in this situation which could have been significantly reduced had the governemnt acted much earlier to isolate those coming into the country from know infected areas. Dire and extremely slow response to prevent hoarding of food. Dire response to protect the vulnerable from job loss and apply for benefits. Worried for the extremely vulnerable relatives I have who haven’t and won’t leave their houses for 12 weeks. Anger tHat the lock down has also been poorly managed persecuting the responsible residents
