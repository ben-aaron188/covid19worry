i feel very anxious. Life in prison. No pleasure, no happiness. I'm afraid to go outside. Large queues of people. There are few products. This is extremely embarrassing to me. I worry about all my old parents. How will they survive this? If something bad happens, it is unlikely that they will be cured. Very high mortality among the elderly. I'm just shocked at the prospect of losing my job. I talked to friends who had lost their jobs. It's just horror! Our lives have turned into a total hell. And what is it for us?
