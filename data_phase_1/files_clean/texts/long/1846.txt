Recent events have showed that no one is immune from this virus, it can affect anyone from the elderly to the very young.As you can not detect it, it is an invisible enemy, which I struggle to cope with.
The Queens address was a boost, but then we got the news that the PM was in hospital. This is not good, it is a living nightmare that we are all living. It will end , but when, it is difficult tp predict. It will be a long time before life returns to normality. At the moment, I am leading a very quiet life , only going out when necessary, unable to see my friends or family.
