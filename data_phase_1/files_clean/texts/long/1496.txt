I feel anxious about the effects on my family as I am currently away from them. I am grateful that my job is safe but feel sad for those who lost their jobs. I am grateful that my family's business which is a convenience store is doing well and so is my brother's job. I am stressed about the pressure for me to go into work soon as I work in the NHS but am currently working from home which feels safer and more appropriate as I can still fulfill my job from home. I am also stressed as I am supposed to be moving out of my flat at the ed of May but everything is up in the air right now.
