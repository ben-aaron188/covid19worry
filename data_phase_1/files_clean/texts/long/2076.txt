I feel on edge most of the time, picking up a feeling of collective anxiety and fear when leaving the house, especially when dealing with the uncertainty of coming into contact with others. I also feel hope when seeing others out and about being kind to eachother from a far. There is a feeling of perseverance amongst the anxiety. With that being said, I also have a feeling of interest and intrigue when keeping up with the news and current affairs, and a sort of excitement to learn about the virus, social and economic impacts and the ways in which people are overcoming adversity.  In general I have a mixed feeling of hope, anxiety and uncertainty
