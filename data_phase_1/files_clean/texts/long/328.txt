i feel anxious as we dont now what is going on, as well as that, lockdown is mentally draining and i want it to all go back to how it was previously. i also feel anger to the people that arent following the lockdown rules as the quicker they follow the faster were out of it all hopefully. i also miss my friends :( but this experience also allowed me to discover my old passions once again. And has allowed me to get closer with my family even though its starting to be annoying. but it has also taught me that i am very fortunate as to where i live who i lve with etc  because for some, this time is horrible

idk if this is the end of the survey but stay safe and stay indoors :)
