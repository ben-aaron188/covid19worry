CUrrently i am quite concerned about the current situation. although none of my household is high risk i do have family members who are.my work are closed due to lockdown which is allowing me time i dont normally have to spend with my son which is brilliant but the circumstances are definitley not. i am angry that so many people are ignoring government guidelines and putting so many people at rsk.the future beyond lockdown is also quite a big concern. i work for a famiily business which is probably going to struggle with the economic climate after lockdown which then puts my job at risk and my husbands because we work together. i think its going to take a long time for us to recover from this.
