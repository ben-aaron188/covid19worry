Worried about loved ones catching it and dying. We have older parents with other underlying health conditions. They are shopping and walking and staying indoors. We know someone whose daughter works as a health care assistant on a ward that deals with the Corona virus. It's not the intensive care ward but deals with undiagnosed cases. I am a key worker. I work as a Teaching Assistant at a Primary School.  We are working on a rota at the moment.  Next week it will be my turn to work and it scares me. My own children are teenagers and able to be trusted to be at home doing their school work, what if I get the virus and infect them? My husband is a keyworker.  He is a civil servant who can not work from home.  I hope he won't come into contact with anyone. There are 2m distance measures in place but not everyone abides by them. I nearly jumped a mile when someone coughed in B&M near me. I literally wanted to run out of the shop. I am happy to self isolate,  its lovely to spend more time with my family.  Our dog is benefiting from longer walks every day (we take it in turns to walk him and it counts as our exercise.  I feel that in the UK we are lucky to be well informed through our government and news channels.
