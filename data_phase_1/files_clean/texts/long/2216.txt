I feel that many people around the country are doing their best to follow the government's rules however, the minority are still choosing to do what they want. I think these people should have much worse punishments than to be told to go home by the police. I am more scared for myself now, as new evidence suggests that the virus can have huge impacts on people of all ages and all health cases. I am also very angry at china as they have now started using bear bile as a remedy for helping cure this virus, which is similar to where this all started. there should be much more coverage on why this started and how we all can prevent this happening again.
