I feel indecisive and stressed as I can't get any food delivery slots at the moment and am trying to avoid all people other than my family who I live with. We are running low on food.  I feel angry that I and my family have self-isolated to save lives and the NHS yet everyone has been walking around and going out like there is no lockdown.  It makes me feel like people are selfish and deluded to think they'll be OK, or to just simply not care that other, more vulnerable people will be greatly endangered, or even die, from their irresponsible actions.
