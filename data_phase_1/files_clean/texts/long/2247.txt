I'm living alone at home but surprisingly doing okay. I do miss the outside world and people but I'm getting to focus on improving skills that I can (software) and working on assignments. I am anxious about the future as I have a limited amount of time and resources to get employed when things settle down. I am managing to develop a better understanding of myself in this time though because I feel there are a greater of variables I am in greater control of and I'm being able to control temptations and impulsive behaviour (that I do miss to an extent admittedly) that I would on a regular day to day basis. So in short, trying to make the best of what I can but yes, anxious about the future.
