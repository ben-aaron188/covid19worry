I am fearful for a lot of things. Mainly how the economy is going and dont really see an end to the situation currently. I dont feel the government are providing enough information regarding the situation. I fear losing family members, parents in particular, due to Corona. I am also sad I cant see family members. At times I feel bored and isolated. I worry about the food situation. It is difficult to get to the shops and get food, but at the same time impossible to get delivery slots. I worry that if I get corona, or abother family member gets it, how well will our bodies cope with it. I have known people get it and come through the other side, but there are so many deaths I worry would I be one of the unlucky ones.
