I feel sad that many people will die. I feel a little anxious that I will contract the virus however I take courage in the fact that I am young, fit, healthy, without any medical conditions nor do I take any medication. However I am fearful for my elderly grandfather who is at risk and is self isolating for the 12 week period as directed by the government.

I feel disgusted that the government was too slow and has been incompetent in their response to this crisis. We had some time to plan ahead since the warnings were coming out of China in the early part of the year. I feel let down by the government ministers when I discovered that they had planned for an epidemic response in the future but they did not buy the correct PPE as it was deemed too expensive.

I feel angry that the healthcare workers in the NHS such as myself have been put at risk of contracting the coronavirus which is avoidable with the correct PPE. 

I am annoyed by the poor response and lack of understanding / engagement by the general public. I was walking to work the other day when I walked past a party in someone's garden. 7+ people drinking alcohol, music etc. It's annoying as this is disrespectful. The public may clap at 8pm on Friday or whenever but it is hypocritical to clap and say thanks for the NHS then go and break the rules which we are trying to put in place and enforce to reduce the death rate, reduce the burden on the NHS and help the country out.
