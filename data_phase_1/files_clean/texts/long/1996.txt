I am disgusted with some of the actions of some countries such as Hungary granting Orban emergency powers to strip the rights of trans people, and disgusted with the inaction of countries such as the USA and our own. I am also angry with how underfunded and stretched our health service is due to past under-funding. However, I feel like I can see a light at the end of the tunnel as most people have taken the advice of medical professionals to isolate which is beginning to slow down the disease's effect. On a personal level, I have been feeling lonely in my self-isolation and am missing my friends and family.
