I feel so sad and confused about Corona. Tying to enjoy every single minute of my life and every my family member! I do really hope everything will soon go better. Started to work from home, kids learningat home too. Its very funny and we all enjoying so much every day and minute we are together! We do cooking, gym, learning..everything together. And it makes us very comfy and at least then happy! Do really think all will go through all this VIRUS so easy and we will find a cure for this virus. As i really want to live longer ab=nd enjoy my time with my family.
