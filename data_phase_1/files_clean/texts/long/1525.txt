I feel a constant state of semi-anxiety and dread. It is difficult for me to relax normally so everything is more heightened. I’m tired as I have trouble sleeping. I often feel anxious about the future and when I will next see my sister, boyfriend and go back to work. I’m worried about my family’s finances during all of this. I currently feel calmer than I did a couple of weeks ago, less physical symptoms of stress, ever since my workplace assured me of having full pay and working from home. Having that stability has made me feel slightly better than before
