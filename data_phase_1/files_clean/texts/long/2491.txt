I am concerned for the ill and especially the vulnerable who may suffer in the future. I am also sad about the poor government preperation and response to the pandemic - I believe that its effects in the UK would be less had preventative actions been taken.

I also think the media response has been somewhat mixed. While it is indeed sad that the Prime Minister is in hospital suffering with the corona virus, he and his government have consistently damaged the NHS's ability to act correctly and his own lacklustre leadership has only cemented this. His ""herd immunity"" strategy all of a sudden doesn't seem so smart when he and his ministers realise their wealth and power doesn't put them above the rest of the herd, does it?
