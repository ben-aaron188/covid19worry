I feel anxious as the numbers keep rising ..it makes you worry about if you do catch it because even though got no underlying health problems , younger people do still die. I am hoping the deaths start to go down now because there was a decrease today and it's been 2 weeks since lockdown so hopefully will start to see the effects of that. I'm scared to go to supermarket but know I have to as here are no online delivery slots . And I appreciate these are for vulnerable and I can get to the shop, but it's made us all so scared and have to disinfect all the packaging when get home because loads of people would have touched the items. Also become anxious about cleaning and disinfecting the house every day even though not been out. On a plus note, it has made everyone just slow down which I think is great. It makes us all realise all the money we spend on stuff we dont need and we have time now to sort stuff out in the house, read a book etc. But I miss being able to go for  a picnic or drive to a nice place for a walk
