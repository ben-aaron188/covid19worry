i feel very angry with china for wanting to eat bushmeat and for supposedly concealing the severity of the situation when it broke out, which could have saved the rest of the world. selfishly, i'm not thinking much about the deaths, only that I've had to leave university, my friends and my boyfriend to sit at home and do nothing when i should be celebrating the end of my first year. i feel this has been ripped away from me and many other people in the world, especially those in year 13 of secondary school (unable to complete their a-levels) and in their 3rd year of university, who do not even get to experience graduation. I feel so sad for these people.
