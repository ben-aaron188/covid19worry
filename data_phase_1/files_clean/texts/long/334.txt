Everyone in my household has been ill and recovered. We're now settling into a routine at home and I'm spending so much more time with my children- that makes me feel very relaxed, content and grounded. I feel insulated from the outside world that we now see almost nothing of. It feels peaceful and the outside world is starting to take in a sense of unreality. I'm actually beginning  to hope we can stay in lockdown longer as it's really quite good for our family. I look forward to seeing family and friends in person again though.
