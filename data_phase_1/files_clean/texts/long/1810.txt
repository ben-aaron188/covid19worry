I feel uncertain and not in control of things and am left wondering when ur will finally end but information is conflicting and the government have no stabilising influence at this time. It makes me feel angry at how it’s being handled. Anxious for the future and the impact it will have on my business. Sad that I can not see my mum who is in the extremely vulnerable catagory and isolating in cornwall miles away. I feel I have little control at times and find this situation frustrating and it leaves me feeling restless. I’m not sleeping as well and restless and finding it harder to relax than I used to.
