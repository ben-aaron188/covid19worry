I understand the importance of everyone doing their part in staying home and abiding but the rules. However, I feel a lot of sadness and disappointment in being stuck at home alone and I am finding it incredibly hard to motivate myself to even do the simplest of tasks. Additionally, my degree has been cut short and I am still expected to complete university exams and coursework but I am lacking any motivation to do so. Overall, I fear for my vulnerable family members and I struggle to uplift my mood during the day.
