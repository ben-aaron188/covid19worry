I feel worried about what is going to happen to the country and how it's going to affect my life. I don't worry too much about getting the virus but I worry that my parents might. I think the future economic problems will be very bad though and we don't know quite how bad yet. I feel quite constricted, on the news they have lots of items about people ignoring the social distancing rules or being fined and I worry that the government will ban all outdoor exercise and I'll be even more constricted. I think people are getting overly angry at these ""bad"" people in society because there's nothing else for them to get angry at really and that worries me. Most of the people dying now will have caught the virus before the country went into lockdown so I feel their anger is misplaced. On top of all this they've cancelled all visa processing so I'm worried about when my spouse will be able to get their visa and come to the UK.
