I feel quite anxious, especially when I watch the news or press conferences about the current situation. I feel anger when I read about people not following the lockdown rules and sadness when I read about the rising death count. I feel particularly worried about elderly family members and when I think about how long the pandemic is likely to last. I also feel quite bored being stuck in the house and miss my friends. I wish we knew when lockdown is likely to be lifted as the uncertainty seems to make it all worse.
