I am worried about more vulnerable members of my family getting the virus and becoming seriously unwell with it. I am also anxious about family members who I canâ€™t see at the moment. 

I am worried about my job as I work with vulnerable families and I am currently working remotely which means that they have less support. 

I am anxious about going out now due to the risk of coming into contact with the virus. I feel that some people are not following the restrictions which makes me feel worried.
