I’m Feeling a bit worried and anxious about corona. I’m concerned that my sister will catch it and be seriously ill or die as she has congenital heart disease. I’m also feeling bored at being cooped up in the house. every day is very repetitive with the same activities and I feel that life is just passing by.

I am also annoyed at people who are carrying on as if nothing is happening as they are spreading the virus and will make us all stay in lockdown for much longer. I am annoyed at people going shopping to unnecessary shops to buy items that are not essentials.
