I feel very fearful and scared about what is happening right now over the corona virus 
The not knowing when or if it will ever be resolved 
I am anxious about when I have to go shopping for provisions that if I am going to be able to get what I need and also catching the virus as I have a vulnerable person at home I care for and if I got it then we would all get it.
I feel anger about China and how I think that they have lied throughout this whole pandemic not only about the virus itself but bout their death toll, I do t see how spain and Italy can have so many deaths but China doesnâ€™t
