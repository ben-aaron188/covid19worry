I'm worried about elderly parents. I'm worried about my kids education. I feel exhausted and overwhelmed. I worry about my kids getting infected. I starting to worry less about food and provisions tho we still have no toilet paper. I feel disappointed for my kids and for myself on fun things we can't do. I feel like im doing my bit but Im so upset about not seeing my mum and mother in law who are on their own  every day feels the same and Im starting to get bored too.
The kids are acting up and fighting. I feel like my husband doesnt have to deal with this as much. Im trying to work too.
