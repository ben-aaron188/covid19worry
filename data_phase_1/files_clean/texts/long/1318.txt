Worrying tImes as cannot see family. Some famIly members do not have the Internet and therefore are stranded and unable to keep in touch.
Scared of losing not only elderly family but also any family member or friend.  This is taking so many lives.
Anxiety is sky high. Currently working from home but fearful of even leaving the house.  Scared of going near people, or people even getting close. Afraid of touching anything outside the house.  Neighbours have been amazing by going shopping for us, but even the fear of cleaning the food packaging is hitting me, not knowing how many people have actually touched the packaging. 
 Fearing loss of job and money. 
Everybody fearful of current situation.
