I feel like this situation is bad in regards to needless loss of life. It also has a positive, it allows us all to slow down and LIVE LIFE rather than constantly doing the same cycle of work and no term for our families.
It allows us to see what's really important, we are all vulnerable and time is not replaceable, our jobs will replace us, it's time to slow down and appreciate the simple things in life.
It's a shame that our government took a little longer to tell people to stay home. They made a big mistake not checking people at airports when they arrived.
