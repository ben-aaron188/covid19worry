Primarily, I am extremely anxious about the whole situation. I am worried about the health of my family and friends, myself and the world in general. I am worried about the economy and everyone’s livelihoods. And I am worried about my future plans, which this whole situation is threatening to affect quite profoundly. 
I am also very angry. I’m angry at how people making poor decisions and breaking the law led to this outbreak starting in the first place. And I’m angry at how unprepared governments around the world have been for this sort of situation.
