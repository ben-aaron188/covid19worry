Very unfornuate to those who have been affected, I am fortunately not affected and neither is my family so far. There are some benefits to the planet in terms of climate change and it has highlighted some negative things in our way of life, so for this there is a positive side that we can be happy with if we all stay safe and obey the lockdown. The most concerning thing in my opinion is the upcoming recession/depression because if people are still out of work well after the pandemic, there will be a more severe problem which is the collapse of the global economy, having such a major and volatile event might lead to unrest in the world and the possibility of war.
