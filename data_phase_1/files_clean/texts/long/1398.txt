I am feeling very let down in regards to Coronavirus, I do not feel enough is being done to protect the vunerable and elderly. I am angry at the people who can't abide by social distancing rules meaning this is going to go on for way longer than is necessary and i am upset for all the people who have died and those who have lost loved ones and cant be there in those last moments. 
i do not think the government is doing enough to protect our county and i am angry that it took them so long to put the country on lockdown when they knew what was coming based on what we witnesssed happening in china and still they did nothing, 

i am also angry that not everyone is being tested, as some show no symptoms this means that those doing their 'essential shopping' can be passin around this virus without knowing and causing more damage, we should not have to wait until we are hospitalised before further exploration is done as that is proving to be too late for too many
