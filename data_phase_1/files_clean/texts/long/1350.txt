I have not found myself yet infected with civid but I feel sadness for the people who have and surcomb to the virus, my anxiety is made worse when I do have to go out in public once a week and I feel anger watching the news because the NHS should never have been in the state it is now, and anger when I see groups of people not following government atvise, I just want to slap them if it wasn't for the 2 metre rule, I feel there is light at the end of the tunnel if people just cooperate, I have found that the lack of freedom has made me feel more depressed than usual however my spirits are kept high knowing this whole situation will end at some point and life will return to normal for the majority of us, infact after isolation for so long it will be like entering a new world, now I feel better
