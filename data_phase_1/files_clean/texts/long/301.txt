I feel generally anxious about the uncertain and dynamic nature of the situation. This combined with a sense of frustration for some of the things I've had to put on hold due to the current restrictions on leaving home have been difficult. My apartment feels very small and cramped now that we can't go outside. I am also feeling very grateful for the weather that is at least giving some happiness to the situation. I am also enjoying spending more time with my partner which makes me feel relatively happy and having additional time to cook healthy meals and exercise.
