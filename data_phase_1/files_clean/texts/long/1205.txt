I cannot wait for this to finish and I hope people will respect the lockdown and stop going out like everything it's normal. I keep seeing everyday a lot of people out like they do not care. I have to go out everyday to work as I do work in NHS and I am disgusted by all these people. I think until they or someone close to them gets the virus they will not take it serious. Also I believe the fines for breaking the lockdown need to be way more drastic, starting from Â£1000 and if it happens the second time it should double.
