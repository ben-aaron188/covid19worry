I am particularly worried at the symptoms and effects of the disease, with its varying effects for everyone. I am also worried about the continuously changing information which means I am unsure what the best action to take is, apart from staying at home. I am also worried about the state of the NHS at present, and if it can cope with the pressure it may see itself under; however as of today it appears new infections and deaths may be falling already. This can only continue if people continue to listen to the advice are are not ignorant or defiant.
