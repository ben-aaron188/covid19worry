Anxious with my line of work being at high risk (healthcare). Stress of exposure. The team I work with are very supportive but also anxious of staffing issues. It frustrates me that people are not taking this seriously and ignoring the advice, putting me and my colleagues at work at risk of exposure. The government advice was very variable but has improved. I am not hopeful that it will be resolved in the near future due to other people ignoring advice. There is uncertainty over our financial situation due to the economy, which has caused stress for everyone.
