I feel lonely as can't meet up with friends and family and miss them. I feel fearful as worried about me, my family or friends getting the virus. I feel slightly sad as nothing to look forward to as not sure how long this will be going on for, can't seem to get excited about anything as there is nothing planned. I'm hopeful that things will improve in the future and hopefully life will get back to normal. The news is depressing and not sure if it is being exaggerated or whether it is the truth, no nice news coming out
