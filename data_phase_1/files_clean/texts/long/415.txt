I am very worried for my daughter my family and my friends. I'm worried about running out of food because I haven't been stockpiling. The shops are scary and frightening so I am running low on lots of basic food. I miss working. I'm worried about running out of money and losing my house. I'm also worried about when this is going to end if it's going to keep on for ages. I dread seeing the death toll every day incase its higher than yesterday. The death toll shows people as statistics instead of the people they were. Its dehumanising.
