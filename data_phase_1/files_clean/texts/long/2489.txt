I am sad that my life has changed so dramatically. I miss doing the things I like to do, and my friends.

However I also feel guilty about feeling sad, as I know I am very lucky as I have a job, I am working so that fills my time, I have a roof over my head, space to exercise, and nice people around me. 

I have not yet known anyone to who has had coronavirus to any level of severity, and I am worried about when this will happen and who it will be. I am worried about my friends who have lost their jobs. I am worried about my relationship. I am worried about the economy.
