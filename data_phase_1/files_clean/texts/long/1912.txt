Not so much worried for my own health, more other people especially my own family as we have a 3 month old baby which is difficult in lockdown, especially for my wife. So anxiety for them and worried I'll bring it home as I'm a key worker that uses a lot of shared equipment. Also sadness for the ones who have lost people, especially because they cannot grieve properly. There is some happiness though, the roads are quiet, the air seems cleaner, people seem friendlier and its put the culture war caused by Brexit to one side, people have realised we have more in common than what divides us.
