I want to help in some active way, not just passively staying at home.  I'm OK, I have the resources to stay home, although I'm frustrated that my job search has been interrupted, but most of all I want to help.  Sooner or later, I'm going to need income, and I'm worrried about that too -- I don't qualify for any of the government's relief aid.  And I'm tired, tired of following the news, and the stupid decisions other people are making.  There isn't any good news.  At least the weather is improving, that should lift my spirits.
