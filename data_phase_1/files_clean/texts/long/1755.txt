Although I feel happiness that I can have a break from work to focus on other things, I feel anxiety on a daily basis. I feel anxious that I cannot see my boyfriend, and I feel I have no freedom. I feel depressed not having a structure to my day anymore, as it leaves me lost and without a purpose. I miss being at work as work gave me a purpose to get up and get ready. I enjoyed mixing with a variety of people and I miss that feeling of coming home and relaxing after a long busy day.  However, I feel slightly optimistic for when this time passes and I can see my boyfriend again.
