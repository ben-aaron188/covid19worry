I feel optimistic that people will play their part and help us get back to normal sometime soon. However, I'm worried about the economic impacts and what that will mean for the most economically vulnerable. I also worry for my parents and other family members who won't be able to see each other for a while, and for those older family members that aren't taking mitigation measures advised by the government seriously. Additionally, I feel angry at the government for what looks like several major failures along the way.
