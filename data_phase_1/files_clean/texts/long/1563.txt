It feels like it is not real and that at any moment I will wake up and things will have returned to normal.  I feel dreadfully sorry for all the poor people who have sick relatives and for the families of those who have died.   In some ways good things are coming of this lockdown with less pollution and no planes in the sky.    I miss being able to travel and meet with family and friends.  I am working from home and find I am getting a lot of work done each day because not so many phone calls.  I am enjoying some quality time at home with close family.   I am worried about the economy and all the people who have lost their jobs over this virus.
