I feel that being locked in at home will take a toll on anybody's mental health, and that it has made me more sad, and slightly anxious as to when this will end. Spending hours locked in with the same people is exhausting and boring. I really want to go outside and see my friends, we are all anxious as we are to be assigned grades which may not reflect what we could have achieved, were exams to take place this year. This has made us all quite stressed too, as these exams will allow us to progress to further education. I also feel worried for my older relatives, who are also finding it difficult to stay at home, for their safety and health.
