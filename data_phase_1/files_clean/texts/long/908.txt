Currently I feel moderately anxious about the situation and the extent to which it has escalated so far. Not knowing how long the pandemic will last and the consequences it will have on the future are my main sources of worry. 

I am not particularly concerned about getting ill, my focus is mostly on the consequences of the pandemic, especially on employment opportunities in the future and the economy. I fear that combined with Brexit, this unprecedented situation will completely topple our economy and it will be difficult to recover. I already had economic worries before COVID-19 and those worries have been exacerbated by the closure of businesses and rising unemployment. The pandemic has struck global markets to an unprecedented level and, without being a member of the EU anymore, a lack of trade could quickly become a serious problem affecting the UK's recovery.
