Extremely anxious about the short term and long term future. Very worried about health and friends and family. Feeling lonely and isolated and struggling to work from home. Unable to see how the nation will get out of lockdown as this seems to be something that governments across the world ate do not agree on. Feeling overwhelmed by the conflicting information coming from the government and scientists. Feeling angry that the government seems to have reacted quite slowly to the situation, and that the messages to the public werenâ€™t clear enough at the beginning. Feeling angry at those members of the public who are not abiding by the lockdown rules as this will mean the situation will last even longer.
