I feel anxious about what this means for my birth plans. I was planning a home birth in 8 weeks but it is now unclear whether that will go ahead. Iâ€™m also trying to work full time while looking after a toddler which is very difficult. The most difficult part is the uncertainty. If we knew when this would all be over, I and other people would feel much more positive about the situation. I am trying to find the positives in general - I am getting to spend more time with my son and my husband which is lovely.
