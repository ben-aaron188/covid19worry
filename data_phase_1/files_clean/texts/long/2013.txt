I just feel a bit anxious about the whole thing - the unknowns. Will we get a vaccine for coronavirus? In the mean time, are people who have had it actually immune? How long will the lockdown go on for? Will it affect my job? Will relaxing the lockdowns cause a resurgence. It's all a bit scary. There are so many questions that we do not know the answer to. But despite this, I am hopeful, and I just take every day (stuck in my house, but at least I have a garden) as it comes. It's quite relaxing, but a good deal boring at the same time.
