Not to happy doesn't know when this will end just feel imprisoned. Just can't be socialising missing friends and family. I can manage to excercise and cycle. But miss the gym. Think alot of people are grumpy. Which doesn't help. As we're all in this situation together. Every thing seems to be coronavirus. You switch the TV on all you hear about. Just want positive hear they have a vaccination and cure. I am very anxious what is going on as everyone else. Plus I usually go cycling alot for days out but unable to manage that. I seem to be sleeping very well parhaps to much.
