At this moment the way I feel it's a mix of emotions that is draining my confidence and hope in the future.
I feel very said for all the people who died all over the world, worried about my dear one living with me and the ones not living with me.
Worried because I have health problems and worried and thankful  because my husband it's still working but that puts him in danger.
Worried because I have lost my job due to this virus an economic crisis and because I don't know if I am going to get a new job on a near future.
Worried because when I watch the news about what's happening around the world I don't think we are doing enough. I'm staying at home with my child but I don't think people are understanding the real estate of things and they are taking it lightly.
People must understand that staying at home it's not a bad thing.  A bad thing is not to have a home and not to be alive tomorrow.
