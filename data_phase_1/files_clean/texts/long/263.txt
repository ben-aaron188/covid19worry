I am very anxious and worried about the COVID-19 Coronavirus. I am scared I might catch it, and that my family and friends will catch it. I am scared we will die. I am scared of the daily numbers. I am scared to leave the house. I am fearful of what the future holds, and what will be left standing when we leave the house. I miss my family and friends. I miss being able to leave the house to go into town for coffee, to eat out, to socialise, to shop etc... I am anxious when I see other people and not to go too close to them.
