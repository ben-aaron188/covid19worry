I feel quite nervous as the virus is spreading fast and people do not seem to be taking it seriously, not following social distancing and acting very selfishly, continuing about their normal lives with no regards for the fact that they could pass the virus on to other people who might not be able to cope with the virus.  Although I am not so nervous for my health, I worry for other people who may be vulnerable. It is a scary time for everyone  and people need to take it seriously before it gets even worse.
