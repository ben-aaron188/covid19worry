I feel scared and wishing it all to be over, worried financially as well. I'm worried I'll lose my job resulting in me losing my house. I wish the end was here but I cannot see an end near and I'm worried we will stuck in isolation for a long time. I miss my family and friends. I miss the pub. I miss socialising and doing what I enjoy. I feel depressed staying at home. Before this all started I was having therapy for depression and now that's been cancelled for the foreseeable future and now I feel lost and not sure if I can cope any more.
