I am scared by the uncertaintly of the situation and how heavily it has affected my life already. The UK is hardly in its hardest times yet so many things have gone wrong or have been negatively affected already. Personally, not being able to see the people I have been closest to recently is having a detrimental effect on my mental health, and self-isolation is proving to have an effect on my physical health. I wish to see my friends and to go about my daily life however I understand that these are things I will have to put on hold for the time being. I am just scared that others will not be so sensible and do not understand the consequences of their actions
