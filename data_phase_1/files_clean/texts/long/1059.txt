Honestly it mostly feels very surreal. I spend a lot of time at home anyway (I work from home as a freelance artist) so it doesn't feel too different from my everyday life, but I just feel like there is a big dark cloud of uncertainty and anxiety at the back of my mind at all times. (It feels shared though, like everyone else is also feeling this.) I live with my partner and we get on very well so I have felt supported in that way, but feeling ever so slightly afraid every time we leave the house and not being able to see our friends is quite difficult. I think it feels almost like a grieving process. You can be distracted from thinking about it for a certain amount of time, and when you are reminded, all the fear and confusion and frustration comes back anew. I am worried for the economy and I'm saddened for people who will lose people or suffer, and for the NHS and its workers. I'm angry at the government for stripping back the resources needed to fight it, and for being lax at every opportunity. It feels very like we are helpless. There is next to nothing we can do, besides supporting our friends and family (remotely) and reaching out to neighbours. It's very hard to get my head around the entire situation as a whole, and as such, it feels very surreal.
