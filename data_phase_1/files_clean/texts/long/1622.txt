Right now I feel sad and uncertain about the future. I have lost a little bit of hope and feel anxious about the whole thing. How is something like happening in this day and age (21st century). I just feel sadness wherever I go. It feels like everywhere is deserted and people are too afraid. Kids don’t really understand what is going on. It just feel like I am dreaming, more like a nightmare. But I pray to God this ends very soon so we can all resume on our normal life. 
I haven’t got anymore words to express how I am feeling right now. I have detailed all my emotions/feelings as best as I possibly can.
