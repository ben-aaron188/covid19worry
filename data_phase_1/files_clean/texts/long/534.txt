I'm feeling slightly worried about this but overall optimistic. I'm worried as if my dad gets it he has an extremely high chance of dying as chemo has left him with an extremely weak immune system, but I'm feeling optimistic as we're all coming together as a community and are working together and I know that we can get through this as long as we stick together as a community and as a team. Our governments have been doing all that they can and our essential workers and NHS and healthcare staff have been putting themselves on the line which is why I have hope for us that we will get through this.
