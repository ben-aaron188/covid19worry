I feel disgust towards a lot of people that refuse to isolate. It also highlights how everyone thinks they are an expert, despite the real experts  admitting they've never dealt with this before.
I have no bad feelings or effects about isolating as I normally isolate myself most of the time.
I feel lucky I live in the UK as we have the NHS. I have a friend in the US who is more worried as their health services are fragmented.
I am a little concerned about catching the disease as I have a high BMI and am pre-diabetic so I can't be sure if I'm classed as vulnerable or not.
