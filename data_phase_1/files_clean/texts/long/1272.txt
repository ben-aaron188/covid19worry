Coronavirus its a threat that doesn't discriminate, affecting even the least vulnerable,  but mostly the most vulnerable. It has divided families physically and emotionally - some more than others. It has ruined plans, jobs have been lost, which could have been prevented with harder border control and testing. Thorough travel history should have been taken with multiple testing on individuals who have travelled from high-risk areas. Now, the public has not taken the advice of complete social distancing which still puts pressure on the NHS. A complete lockdown should take place immediately, with reasons to leave property such as shopping only.
