Fear for the future of the world and the economic, environmental , political ramifications of this virus, in the hopes we do not end up in a recession again like 2008. Anxieties about when it will end, whether it will affect me or my family, my education etc. Hope that the UK government will do something more to prevent the spread and to combat the ever increasing peak that we are getting every day. Worries about whether I will be able to continue my education properly with the current coronavirus situation.
