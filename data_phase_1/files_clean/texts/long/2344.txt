I'm angry at the poor response from our government, and the attitudes of most people. It's extremely frustrating to see people wandering about every single day doing non-essential things (I work in a pet store so see this every day I go to work). The attitude of our government is reflected in the people. This won't go away if we bury our heads in the sand and pretend it's a holiday; people are dying, other people are suffering. It's not going to just wear itself out. This will only go away when EVERYBODY makes a commitment to isolating themselves.
