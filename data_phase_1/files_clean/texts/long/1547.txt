Very worried that we have no idea what will happen, no nation seems to have emerged from the crisis, It's so widespread now I don't think it's possible to contain it, and a vaccine will take a long time. I'm worried about how many people will die.

I don't think things will ever be the same again, we have no way of knowing what life will be like when we emerge from this, if indeed we do emerge from it. We may all die.

I'm also upset that we are in this position because of the culture of greed, ""getting away with it"" and anti-intellectualism of our leaders and a large portion of society.

I'm horrified at the behaviour of Donald Trump, his stupidity and lies and how insulting his behaviour is to the American people. I'm also horrified that people actually support him.
