While it is a pandemic, I think a lot of the people taking unnecessary risks deserve what they face. Combined with the fact that the population needs a cull, I donâ€™t personally have much stake in the situation emotionally. I am not high risk, nor is my partner and we have taken all necessary precautions and are not risking our health or our families. If they chose to do so, they accept the risks and that it means an immediate severance of all contact until the risk has passed. My workplace took rapid action before it was required so my job is secure as we are an essential industry with the capabilities to work from home
