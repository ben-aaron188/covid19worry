I feel very anxious about what is going on around us, I can't even turn on the TV due to anxiety. Being inside is very mentally draining and I am not motivated to do anything. I'm angry that the government seems to have been slow to put in place and I'm angrier still that people are going for picnics and sunbathing as part of their daily exercise. People on my street are still going to the local shop daily for a paper. I am afraid we will end up like Italy or Spain, and I'm afraid we won't go back ""to normal"" for a long time. I really want it to be over, and I know others do too. It's very painful to watch.
