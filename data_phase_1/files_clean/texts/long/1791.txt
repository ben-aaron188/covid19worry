I am concerned about the effects of the virus on the world as a whole as well as in my own country. I really hope we can slow the spread of the disease and hopefully find a cure before things get too bad. I am not too concerned for my own health but I don't want to take any risks! 

There is also a considerable financial concern. I am currently not working and the things that I had lined up to do this year are now no longer possible. Things like travel, festival word and other paid opportunities that now cannot happen.

Because of this I need to look for new and different opportunities as we have no idea when any of the things that I had wanted to do will be possible!
