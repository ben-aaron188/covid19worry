I feel very worried that someone close to me will suffer from COVID and potentially die, especially a family member that currently works in the NHS and lives with my elderly nanna. I'm also scared that lockdown will be stricter and that I can't go outside, I'd really worry for my mental health as I already struggle with anxiety. I've worked on my anxiety for years and developed a routine of going out, going to work etc. and I feel stricter lockdown would undo all of that work. I'd be worried about returning to normality afterwards and how I would adjust and cope to it.
