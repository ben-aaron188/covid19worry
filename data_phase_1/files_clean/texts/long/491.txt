Annoyance that I see people disobeying the rules and the police not enforcing the rules harder. I feel they should be doing more but there is also the responsibility of the public to set police them selves better. I think the police should publicly name and shame offenders who disobey the government guidelines and issue heavier fines much like they are in other parts of the world. I think the government should also be utilising itâ€™s Armed Forces more in a positive way by giving aid around the world to commonwealth countries that require it.
