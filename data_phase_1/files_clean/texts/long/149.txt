i feel quite worried because of the COVID19 and everything connected to it. I am worried  not only because of the health , financial worries are other part of my general worries. I feel sad that too many people have passed away because of this terrible virus, too many people suffers and it is terrifying . Although NHS working on their full capacitet. there is not enough doctors ans special equipments for these that need it. I really hope that all this will end soon and that we will return to our normal life.
