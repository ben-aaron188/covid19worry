I am quite anxious as my mum is very vunerable but is so missing going out and seeing people, this makes me ver sad. I am also getting more worried myself about catching it as i have to go to supermarkets to do all the shopping for two house holds and worry that i may take the virus back into the family home. I am missing my grandchildren enormously and we facetime each other but its not the same as being able to give each other a hug. One thing this virus has learnt me is dont ever take normal day to day living for granted.
