I currently feel relaxed, but a little afraid I am not being productive enough. I fear my overall PhD progress is being affected by the disruption to my normal routine, as I can't technically pause the workload, although this may then have consequences later on, despite the outbreak. I do feel relaxed, but feel less motivated to do work. In a way, I am torn between allowing myself to be a little less strict with my work ethic, as an adjustment to this new lifestyle, and being concerned about where this will lead me career-wise in the long-term, and if the latter even matters as much as it mattered before, considering the current circumstances.
