Disappointed how some people are still not taking it seriously and the fairly ""relaxed lockdown"" by the government is not helping.
I understand people get bored (I get bored too) so they go outside, then others see them and think ""Well if they are out I will go out too"" but this is not helping to stop the spread. 
I worry this will last for quite a long time.
I wish I could do more to help but I am worried that if I get sick I will make my housemate sick who is classed as vulnerable person.
