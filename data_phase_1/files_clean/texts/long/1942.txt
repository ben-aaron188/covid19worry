I am worried about catching the virus, as us everyone else.  I am not going out, except for food shopping when I can’t get home deliveries.  I have started to use a meditation app in order to control my anxiety and enable me to sleep at night.  I started to use this tool after suffering a few nights of broken sleep.  On occasion I feel overwhelmed by the risk of catching the virus and have taken to watching less television news to control the overload of information.  I miss seeing my son who lives in his own house and also my dad who lives in a local care home as he has dementia. Bathe home has a “no visitor” policy in place.  I worry about him getting the virus and dying alone.
