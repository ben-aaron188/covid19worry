Disgusted and angry with the government, poor leadership.
Lies and false  promises of future action that will not happen ie testing of NHS staff. Blame of other as media distraction, ie public distancing over the last weekend and pay of  footballers.
Constant use of war metaphors by politicians in a call to rally to the flag rather than challenge their poor performance.
Annoyed there was no money for the last 10 years until the tory business leaders need a handout then free cash for all.
