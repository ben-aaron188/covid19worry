I am worried about still having to work out of the home in this climate. Not so for the safety of my children not myself.
I wish I could work from home and part of me wishes I even had it so I could stop worrying about what it would be like. 

I’ve had to cancel my wedding cause of this so an annoyed about my day being ruined. In fact now tainted so we are having a smaller wedding as I do not think I would enjoy it fully now.

If ty is goes on for too long we will be in finantial trouble. I would like to feel comfortable enough for my children to go to school. Watching the news death toll rise is horrific but I can’t stop watching
