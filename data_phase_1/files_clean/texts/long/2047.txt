Mixed emotions at the moment. It's my husband's birthday and we had some good news too that will help us to cope financially, so feeling happy about that. Feeling very anxious about the coronavirus in general. My husband is a ""key worker"" so there is a chance he could infect us even though the rest of the family are staying at home. I'm worried for people's health, that their relatives might die, their financial situations, and I worry for my mum. I don't know when she will be able to leave the house again.
