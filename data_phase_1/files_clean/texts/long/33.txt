As I live with my grandparents, I feel worried for them as they already have underlying health problems. I feel anxious with the economy and the huge impact this is already having on it. I am starting to feel lonely as I am stuck inside all day unable to see any of my friends. However, I am getting used to isolation and I believe this could benefit me as it might help me feel more comfortable and happy by being by myself. I also feel worried as the death toll increases by a lot daily and shows no signs of slowing down.
