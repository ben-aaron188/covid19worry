The corona situation makes me feel very anxious because there are so many unknowns and i believe that there is more information out there than we are being told. 
The situation makes me very annoyed too as the people who are complaining most about how long lockdown is lasting are the same people who are breaking the lockdown rules and causing extensions on lockdown to be necessary. 

i think the governments of all countries need to be more transparent with what is going on and the newspapers need to stop scaremongering and using clickbait to get people to read their papers. This is only causing more fear and anxiety. 

I also believe that the UK government should provide more testing so that the statistics only reflect the true numbers
