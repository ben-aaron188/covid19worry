I feel this is a learning curve for the future, we have never seen anything like this before, we were to slow to respond so  I hope that lessons can be learned. I hope we we still come together and support each other and invest more in healthcare and vulnerable people when this is over. I have not been affected to bad as i can work from home and keep my family safe which is all you  can do at the moment.  I am hoping this is all over within a few months but things could get worse again once things get back to normal if people start getting sick again.
