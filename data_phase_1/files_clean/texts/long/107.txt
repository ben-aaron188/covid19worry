As a final year university student, I'm very sad to have missed the end of my degree, will miss graduation, will miss saying goodbye to many friends + the ongoing uncertainty of when things will go back to 'normal' and if I'll be able to reorganise things. Naturally, at this time of year would be sat indoors revising and working anyway, but with everything feeling like its been paused, it's very difficult to continue with the same motivation. Personally, I feel safe but am very angry seeing the disregard and disrespect from so many that are making this last longer than it needs to.

Also - KCL forever. UCL is a poly xx
