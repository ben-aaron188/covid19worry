I feel that the measures being taken, whilst extreme, are correct for stopping the spread of the virus.I feel annoyed by the whole situation as I have had to make many changes to my plans and lifestyle and have also had to cancel important events. I would like for the spread to be stopped as soon as possible so I am also annoyed about those who are selfish and ignore the restrictions in place. I personally feel calm about the situation as I take the necessary precautions to avoid contracting the disease but I do worry about the older population and especially my older family members.
