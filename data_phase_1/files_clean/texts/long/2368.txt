Can’t believe or quite come to terms with what is actually happening in the world right now, almost doesn’t seem real how many people are being affected by this. It is just Utter utter sadness how many lives are being taken unessassarily. There should have been a stronger plan in place earlier to prevent this, we could see this coming from other countries ie Italy, it didn’t need to happen like this. Just upset and angry for those working on the front line risking their lives without being given the correct protection, a death warrant.      

   Big up the NHS, just hope at the end of this they get the recognition they deserve at very least a rise.
