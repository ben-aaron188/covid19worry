The situation is inconvenient but not too serious. Hopefully we will all get back to normal soon. I sense this situation has been exaggerated by the media and we will look back and wonder what all the fuss was about. I hope to be able to go out and meet my friends again soon. I am positive about the future and feel confident we will come out the other side a bigger and better country. I really appreciated the Queen’s speech on Sunday – it was a real morale booster. All We need now is some good weather to lift the mood further.
