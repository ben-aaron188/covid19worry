I feel okay as I have distracted myself with work, however, I went on Facebook a few minutes ago which heightened my anxiety as it was filled with posts about Corona. After seeing coming off Facebook my anxiety is reduced and I become sad. I have found the best way for reducing my anxiety and sadness is staying off social media. I try to stay away as it upsets me and hearing about all the deaths and the difficult times people are going through can be hard for me because i know i can't do anything.
