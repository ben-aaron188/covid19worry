I am upset about the delayed action taken and about the risk front line staff are putting themselves at because the government have failed to prepare by stocking up on equipment and other things needed. I'm am concerned about the deaths to come and that the public are still not taking the situation seriously. I am concerned the PM is unwell and could die through his own foolish ignorance and the economic impact this entire event will have on the world. I am concerned for my job and my own wellbeing and health as well as that of my family I am worried about what the future will hold.
