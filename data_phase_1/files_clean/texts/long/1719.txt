I think although I am in lockdown with family, I feel more alone than before. I came here before lockdown and am now stuck here unable to go back to my independent living. I am thankful to be surrounded by family but sad Iâ€™m not in my own surroundings in a city I normally call home. I am also annoyed with people who are selfishly leaving their homes for none essential reasons - I appreciate food and exercise trips however, when people are meeting with friends or flirting between a family homes this is causing more danger for others
