Worried about my friends and family getting sick and me not being able to see them or look after them. Concern over our household finances now that my husband is unable to work due to the lockdown. Grateful that I live in a nice house with access to a garden so I am able to still enjoy the nice weather without leaving my home. Happy that I am able to keep in contact with my friends and family virtually and that I am still able to work from home during this time so I still get paid. I feel like this is a good opportunity to try and rest and relax at home with my partner and also try and get things done around the home that I have been putting off.
