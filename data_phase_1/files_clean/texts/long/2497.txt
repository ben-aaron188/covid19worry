I feel angry at people who are not following the Government advice - I have seen larger groups of people every day and l have seen many instances of people not following social distancing guidelines.
I feel like the Government are being evasive about the Prime Minister being in hospital which is making me worry that perhaps the situation is being worse than we are being led to believe. I am also very stressed at how NHS workers are unable to access equipment and tests when more well known people are able to access them with what appears to be very little effort.
I worry for self employed people at this time and the support they are getting and I am angry at big companies with rich owners who actually have the capacity to help but do not.
