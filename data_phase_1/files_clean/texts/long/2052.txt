At this very moment I'm quite relaxed about the virus itself as I am doing all I can to prevent spread of infection and following strict guidelines to keep myself and others safe. The other effects of the virus are more what I am struggling with. I'm angry at those not listening and still continuing to break rules. I'm anxious and depressed at being out my routine, not being able to see friends and family and not being able to work as normal either. I'm worried about bills as being home all the time with a family has added to my household energy and food bills.
