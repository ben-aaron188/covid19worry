I feel very sad for the families that have lost loved ones and am also very proud of the nation for coming together and working as a country should, however I  am missing socialising and my freedom and some days can be quite tough going. It is also SSL’s not to be able to see family and friends and to be able to socialise with them. i work in a school and am currently only in once per fortnight.

It is good to have some time to do things at home that usually I don’t have time for me and I do feel relaxed.
