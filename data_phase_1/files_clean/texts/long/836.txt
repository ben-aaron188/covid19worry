The COVID-19 pandemic is currently making me feel extremely anxious and nervous about leaving the house. I see people who have taken it upon them selves to go to friends houses, go to the park and up my rural road for walks, not following the doll I’ll distancing guidelines. It’s extremely frustrating as someone who suffers with anxiety and depression because I feel like I do not have control, not over people as they can make their own choices but over my mental health as I’m forced to stay in where I won’t see my friends etc and it’s difficult. However, this can also be a blessing in disguise to me. I study French language and have been able to focus more on my studies now that I’m stuck at home. I feel on top of things for once and feel like I can catch up and keep up on all of my work as I’m doing it in my own time while also to deadlines. It’s a very contradictory time for my emotional and mental state but for everything else it is frustrating as I love being outside. However, it is selfish of others to go out when realistically that’s what’s making COVID-19 and it’s spread worse. The quicker we all stay inside and self isolate, the quicker this will all be over and we can be vaccinated etc.
