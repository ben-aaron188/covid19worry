I have mixed feelings at present. I am worried about all the people who are ill, the pressure put on the NHS, all the staff who are faced with dealing with the virus and its consequences. I am also concerned for the economic impact it will have on individuals and businesses etc as well as myself. My current home situation however is very pleasant so I feel safe and relaxed in my home which I am incredibly grateful for as I know not everyone is in the same situation and I wish there was something I could do to help those people.
