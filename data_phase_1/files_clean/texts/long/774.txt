I am sad for all the people that have died and their families and I'm worried for myself and my family. I am constantly worrying about symptoms developing and I am worried when I go out to get food. I am hoping than things get better soon and that a vaccine can be developed. I am anxious to get back to normal and see friends and family again and do normal things. I am annoyed at those people still going out as normal and putting other people in danger. I am concerned that something like this will happen every year and that it will have an impact on our society for years to come.
