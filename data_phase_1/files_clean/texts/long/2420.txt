This currant situation is a very scary time period in our lives as it has never happened before and no one really knows how to handle the situation. I’m worried what will happen to my job role the company I work for, I’m worried for the elderly everywhere as they are very prone to caching the virus. Was this set up? Was it a man made virus ? There is not enough information that what is causing this fear of the unknown. How long will I be off work for? How long is this going to go on for? Will there be a vaccine? How much this is going to change the world and economy forever. So many thoughts as to what life will be like after this all ends.
