hope it slowly eases my sister is a nurse and I worry about her health with her having kids but other than that Hope Borris takes more care of himself and he recovers well.  People just need to stay home and heed all advice that the government give out to us.  

Please don't sunbathe I know its really nice out but it doesn't help the rest of us staying in,  Also if you find yourself needing loo roll you are not ill with corona and you are likely suffering from a stomach bug which is going around (I have had it and I feel rough after it)
