Anxious due to not being able to go outside freely and travel to see friends and family. Also anxious as I am trying to complete my university studies and exams but this has been majorly disrupted. Not scared for my own health as I am young and healthy but more concerned for elderly relatives. I am also concerned for what the after effects will be, such as the employment of my family members, and myself as I am looking for employment. I also feel anxiety around gaining weight during this time and not being able to keep as fit and healthy as I would like. I also have some worry about other health concerns should they arise, as it would be unlikely I can seek help about them during this time.
