I feel anxious about going to the supermarket to get food. At the supermarket I feel on edge and hurried. I fee angry with people who are not following the “stay at home unless necessary to leave the house” advice, it is very frustrating to watch social media headlines about these people. I do feel great sadness about the current situation and for families who have lost their loved ones. I feeL admiration for the NHS staff and key workers who are giving everything they have to save lives and support those saving life’s. However I do enjoy making the most of being at home with my child spending quality time together.
