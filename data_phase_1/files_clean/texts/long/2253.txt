I am anxious about getting the virus. I am saddened by all the death and suffering including our prime minister. I am thankful that so far my immediate family is healthy but worry when that might change. The future is so uncertain. I hope God protects us all. I am angry with those who are breaking the social distancing and putting the rest of us at risk. I feel sorry for those that are struggling financially as well due to this virus. It has worsened my mental health as well. I worry I may fall back into a deeper depression. Thankfully I am still able to receive counceling over the phone. I think that too many people are NOT taking this seriously and thus put more people at risk due to their actions.
