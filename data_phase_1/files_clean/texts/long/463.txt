I believe that I feel less worried about the current situation than most people. This is as I am not at a big risk of getting the virus compared to other people. I feel as though the news about the virus is simply making people more and more scared such as myself. Overtime I have become more fearful of the virus and the effect it could have on the people I know. I have to be more careful in what I do to stay safe and to keep the others around me safe. I am hoping that the current lock down situation will be over soon but I am also slightly worried that this may increase the number of cases as well if people are not careful.
