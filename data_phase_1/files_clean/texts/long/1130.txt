I am quite frustrated at with all the restrictions, and disruptions. Planning for the future is so challenging. It is as if my life is in limbo. I am looking forward for all this to be over, and life to return to normal. 

I am also employed as a front line health professional, work is just so draining, there are demands from the public, there are extra demands from my employers, there are also additional challenging demands put on us centrally from the NHS, yet there is not enough support, and this is really draining.
