I am very fearful for my family and friends, I am scared in case anything happens to any of them or they become ill. I am concerned about money and what will happen going forward but that is outweighed with the need to keep everyone safe. The time this will go on for is worrying as it may start to impact my family's mental and physical health and it may mean I do not have a business to go back to. The way people are not listening to the government is a concern and people are taking risks that mean we are all at risk.
