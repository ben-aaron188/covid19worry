Honestly. I like the situation with the epidemic. I spend all day at home. I watch movies, I play games. Just a buzz. I have sex. My family is happy. We don't waste our time on television and news. It's only depressing. Soon it will end and we will live as before. So just a thrill. People use this time for good! develop and don't take nonsense in your head. And everything else will come by itself
I don't care that there are few food stores. I have a large stock. I have claimed this before. Good Luck!
