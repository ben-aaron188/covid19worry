I am worried for myself and my family, the UK as a whole - the impact of the virus will be huge. There will be a second pandemic - the aftermath. 
I just hope that everyone takes the guidance on board and takes it seriously, although I fear there is a majority that aren’t. 
I look forward to better days to come and the celebration after this but it feel strange not knowing when that will be. There is so much uncertainty. So many unknowns. 
Feeling ‘mixed up’ and mixed emotions is a fair way to describe how I feel.
