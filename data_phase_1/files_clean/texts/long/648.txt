I would say I feel downtrodden, very low low energy, cautiously optimistic, as usual etc.   A few weeks ago, I was unable to sleep with stress/worry and slipped into a depression over the Corona situation last month, thankfully I'm better now, just downtrodden, but not hopeless anddespairing etc.  I feel hopeful, overall positive, etc-  yet at the same time a little sombre, I find it difficult to relax, I am stressed etc.  I am high risk because of my asthma, but as there's no delivery slots, I still have to put myself at risk and go out to buy food etc..I am also a carer for my girlfriend who suffers from mental health, so I have quarantined myself with her in order to care for her a best I can during all of this.
