This situation is just shocking! For the first time in history, this is what happens to us. How do I feel? I am in complete despair. I feel the situation is getting out of hand.
Many of my friends have lost their jobs. The government is not helping. The money is running out. In the shops queue. Food is running out. I'm shocked! How it is possible to live. I'm tired of the bad news. My family is suffering. We can't walk down the street normally. We are afraid to get infected. I'm worried about my family.
I worry about my work colleagues
I constantly worry about my parents.
