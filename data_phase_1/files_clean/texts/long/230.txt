I can't imagine how to live on my own
I have a state of constant anxiety because of the epidemic.
I'm worried about my family.
It is very boring to stay at home without work
I worry about my work colleagues
I constantly worry about my parents.
I am afraid our medical system may not cope with many 
I very worry about my work. I may lose my job because of this epidemic.
Horror and anxiety!
I am afraid of losing my savings.
GOD HELP US!!! Help my friends.
It's just some misfortune
It's a dead end
I wish everyone to be strong and to overcome this disease
