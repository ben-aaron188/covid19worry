Mostly concern for the health of loved ones and anxiety at my personal finical situation, as a self-employed small business owner I currently have 0 income which is of course very worrying as the total bills all remain the same amount and equally require paying. My job involves entering peoples private homes which is generally not something people are happy to have happen at the moment, fully understandably so. However this does leave me in a very financially exposed position. I also have fear about my own health when/if entering peoples properties, even when keeping direct contact to an absolute minimum there are still risks of exposure.
I also have an 85 yr old grandmother and we have a few small children in the family, obviously I feel concern for their health and well being.
I am hopeful however that the situation will return to normal moderately soon and all will be well again.
