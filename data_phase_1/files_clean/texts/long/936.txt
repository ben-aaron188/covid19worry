I'm worried about my parents, who are in their mid-to-late 70s. I'm due to graduate in a health-related field and take up a job in a hospital, so I'm concerned about the coronavirus making my experience as a new employee more stressful. I miss my partner, who lives in a different city, since we can't travel to see each other at the moment. Due to social distancing and the loss of my usual outside hobbies I feel quite disconnected from the passage of time. I feel unsettled by the lack of a clear end to this situation.
