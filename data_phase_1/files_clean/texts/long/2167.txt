It still doesn't feel real that we have to go through this as it seems like something that would've happened in history. At the moment I do feel more relaxed knowing I don't have the virus and no one that's close to me does either as we have been taking precautions and following the governments orders. My main worry is when life will be back to normal as everything does seem to be on pause right now. Also, it's sad to hear how the death toll of virus-related cases keep increasing everyday , not just in the UK but in the world.
