I feel upset by it as it means i have to wait longer in order to see my elderly relatives, this is a let down as it was recently my grandma's birthday and as a result the virus has meant that i was not able to go and visit her in person. however thanks to digital means i could still video chat with her on her birthday but its just not the same. The lockdown itself has not been too unpleasant however I cannot work due to it and as id just become self employed i also cannot claim any money from the government which is a bit worrying
