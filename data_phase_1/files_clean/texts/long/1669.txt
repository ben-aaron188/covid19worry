The situation with Coronavirus has caused my life (and more or less everybody else's) to be put on hold. Form me as a professional golfer this means that I am unable to play, causing me to lose my income. This is more than anything just incredibly frustrating. I am not an anxious person but the current situation is making me feel slightly anxious as to when I will be able to get back out to the golf course and begin to improve again. This main anxiety is coming from my inability to do my job which sort of gives me a feeling of pointlessness at the moment.
