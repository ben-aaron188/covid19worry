I feel sadness that I'm unable to see my family at this time as well as being 8 months pregnant and the possibility of no one being able to see the baby until she is out of newborn stage is sad. I'm anxious I may contract the virus and cause harm to my baby and/or family. I'm also stressed at how I will fill my days and entertain a 3 year old until we are out of lockdown. I feel robbed of my final weeks of pregnancy, I cannot enjoy them as much as I had planned to. I'm also concerned financially that we will be unable to make itand that times will be tough by the time the baby arrives which will add extra pressure to a situation that should be enjoyable.
