I feel anxious about the situation. I am waiting to find out whether I am being furloughed. My other half has already been furloughed. I miss my family. It’s my mum’s birthday today and I can’t see her Is she is shielding. Is this life now? When will it end? Will I know anyone who will die? I have messaged my friends and they all seem okay but it’s not the same. Tv is boring after a while and I feel like I will soon be crawling up the walls. 
I feel like the government is doing a good job, they have channelled the NHS. An institution that is properly the only thing all Brits agree on. We police by consent. Britons are turning on one another screaming stay at home to save the NHS.
