I’m bored. I’m not overly stressed about the virus, although I am aware that it would be much stressful for someone more vulnerable than myself. Self isolating is not putting me in the best mood and I feel like my mental health and productivity has been affected. I just want to get back to normal. I’m also upset that all plans have been changed and I won’t be able to live at uni again this year and I find being at home suffocating. If I didn’t have deadlines still I wouldn’t be so bothered by it and I could just chill but I’m stressed about work but at the same time don’t have any motivation to do it which just makes me in a more fragile state. I think the lack of exercise compared to my normal life has also got to me because my moods are more temperamental and I’ve cried multiple times over nothing.
