I feel as though I can’t control the situation which is extremely stressful. I am hoping that we will be able to get through this pandemic as soon as possible. I miss family and friends who I’m not able to see. I also feel angry to those who are ignoring the governments rules. I truly believe that we can get through this, but I do think it’ll get a lot worse first, and I’m not sure how well prepared I am to accept some of the consequences of this. I feel upset because important events such as my 21st birthday and graduation were coming up this year, and have now had to be cancelled.. however I do understand that there’s not much that can be done. The most effective thing that can be done is a vaccine. I have seen that trials will be taking place, however by the time they will be available it could be up to a year, which if of course frustrating as lives are being lost. I feel as though the government are down playing the severity of this pandemic, and I think most people would feel more comfortable if they were more honest so that we can prepare ourselves for that.
