I am very fearful for my family. I am very overweight & don't think I'd survive if/when I get it. My husband is a key worker so very likely to bring the virus home to us, although he is very careful. I wasn't worried initially but the more we find out, it's like a death sentence. I thought young children weren't at risk but we now know that's not the case. I have 3 children & I'm am very scared. Boris Johnson has now been moved to intensive care so we know how that's going to turn out. We are living in a nightmare.
