I feel that it is something society must go through sooner rather than later, and the sooner we finish this the sooner we can get back to our daily lives.

I feel that most people are worried without good reason, and that the media are taking advantage of the situation to further their own agenda.

I trust the government to make the right decision and to protect the interests of the public and the majority of people. I am not bothered by the lockdown, but I am, however, worried about the impending recession.
