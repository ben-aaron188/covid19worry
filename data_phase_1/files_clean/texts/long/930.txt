Mixed emotions as angry at people being idiots. Disappointed with government for not getting PPE sorted, I say disappointment as it’s the Torys so we all know who much they love cutting public services, so it’s no surprise we are in a mess.  Upset for all victims.  Anxiety about leaving the house to shop as no idea if you will be able to get what you need.
Huge anger towards bosses of big companies that furlough staff and then come begging for state handouts (Philip Green!).
Sad about social media as too many bullies on there
