To much doom and gloom on the news. people are showing their true self's in a bad way. don't know who to trust. the rules should be relaxed. the police are taking it to far and should only be catching true criminals. the government are not looking after the peoples money. small business are shutting down and we are going to lose them. Testing should of been done months ago when China had a problem. Protective equipment should of been provided straight away. Lockdown should of been placed where the worst of the pandemic started
