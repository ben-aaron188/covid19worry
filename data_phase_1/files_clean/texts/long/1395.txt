The coronavirus mostly makes me feel disappointed. This is because the best way to overcome this situation is by the whole country working together but that is just not happening as many people are still going out for non-essential reasons. This is only hurting the ones who are staying indoors at all times because it is going to result in us all having to follow these rules, and possibly more strict rules, even longer which, in turn, means we won't get to enjoy our summer in addition to other events such as family birthdays. However, I am feeling some positive emotions. I am a student who lives with 4 other people but they have all gone home and so I am able to relax in a house to myself. I also have more money saved as I am not able to go out and spend it. The thing I'm most happy about is that the levels of pollution in this and other countries has reduced dramatically and wildlife has started to reappear in places where it was scarce. If this virus was from natural causes and not man-made, I believe that it's Mother Nature's way of getting her well-deserved break before we destroy this planet. I'm anxious about what will happen in terms of impact on the environment when this is all over. I hope that we can make a big change for the better.
