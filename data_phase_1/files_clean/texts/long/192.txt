I am trying to remain hopeful that we will beat the virus but with each passing day I hear more and more stories about people becoming unwell and dying from the virus. When all this started we were led to believe it was ‘only the vulnerable’ that would be effected. But passing days shows that this is untrue and everyone is at risk. I am annoyed that not everyone is taking it seriously and some are disregarding the advice or treating the lockdown as an elongated bank holiday. Everyone needs to take responsibility to ensure this virus doesn’t spread.
