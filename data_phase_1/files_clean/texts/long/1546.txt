I feel the current situation regarding the virus has made me appreciate the things that I have a lot a more. The same also goes for friends and family, as I rely on them for company during these hard times. I'm not personally worried about catching the virus, since I am not in any of the 'high-risk' groups, nor do I go outside and mix with people often; but I do fear for older friends that could potentially be at risk (if they were not self-isolating). Hopefully, with time, the virus' damage will reduce, and I will be able to return to work and see my friends that live a long way from me.
