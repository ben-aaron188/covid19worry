I have 2 family members who work for the NHS on the frontline. I am worried they will catch the virus and also that they will pass it on to me. I am high risk and currently on 12 weeks lockdown. My mental health is suffering a bit because I cannot get out but I am coping. I do actually think I have had the virus in a very mild form but the lack of testing is an issue. It is the unknown that is the worst. I think the government is not being strict enough with the public to keep them indoors and should be testing more. Especially NHS workers but equally people in the community
