I am Worried about the future but I am enjoying the relaxation. I wish that people would take corona virus more sensible about the situation as they aren't aware of how serious coronavirus  is. if more people stay in and don't go outside then the spread of corona virus will hopefully decrease people can come out of lockdown and back to normality. I am worried about what will happen regarding my job as I am furlounged and our company isn't being very good with communication. As from after the end of April we have no idea what is going on regarding pay.
