I feel concerned, both that people around where I live (London) are not taking social distancing seriously, and that I or my family may contract COVID-19. I feel some anger at people I encounter on the pavements who do not make eye contact or attempt to move aside, or who give me odd looks when I move into the road to avoid them. I feel anxiety about having to perform my job remotely, as I do not feel equipped to do this well. I feel especial anxiety over the transmission of coronavirus, and the length of time it can potentially be active on surfaces. I worry it may be in the air, floating.
