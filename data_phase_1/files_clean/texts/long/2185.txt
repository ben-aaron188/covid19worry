I am frustrated at the amount of people not listening. I am frustrated in that my job is being made harder by people that donâ€™t listen. I am worried for my colleagues working within the hospitals. I am frustrated that the number of people that are dying from is not enough to deter those flouting the rules. And the number of people that are making inessential journeys is unbelievable. The staff working to keep everyone safe and those exposed to it whilst treating patients throughly deserve the recognition warranted by what they are doing.
