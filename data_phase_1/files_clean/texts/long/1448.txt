I am slightly worried about the thought of getting the virus and worried for my family. I am hoping that this pandemic will be over in six months. It has impacted on my family life. We planned to travel, this now cancelled and we have to adapt to many changes governed by the Prime Minister.  We have to plan most of our shopping in advanced and ensure we have the main items written down. This is new for us as we did not do this before. It, about conforming to a new way of life for us, for me and my family. I am a bit overwhelmed at times and I have to take time to process what is happening around me.
