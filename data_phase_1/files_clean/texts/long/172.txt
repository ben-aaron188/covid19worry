Hoping people take in the advise to stay at home so as not to spread it more. I went to get some food shopping and two runners past by me less then a metre away. Also hoping my family and friends stay safe. Would really like the UK government to step up the testing because a lot of people are going out shopping who are probably carryng the virus, at least testing frontline workers. Also I hope people learn from this and become more stainable with products then the panic buying wouldn't be a thing. I don't think people will change theirs ways but I'm hopeful.
