This is the biggest catastrophy I have lived through - with unknown outcomes - I am at a stage in life where I want to make the most of however long I have left and Coronavirus could negatively impact the quality of that remaining time. I have had difficult times in the past and felt I was now on an even keel and here is something out of my control which will have a significant impact. I want to remain in control of my life but now I have plans I cannot fulfil and I have to twiddle my thumbs and wait for things to improve
