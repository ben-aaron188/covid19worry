I feel that it is only going to get worse if people refuse to listen to what the government have to say and it is worrying because it will keep getting worse.If everyone stays at home and only leaves when necessary then the situation should hopefully be able to improve faster.I feel that not everyone is listening and some are not taking the necessary precautions needed to help prevent it and to keep people safe. I also feel that we are not being provided with enough information and people donâ€™t have access to tests until it is too late and they have already got the virus.
