COVID-19 has caused distress and destruction for many individuals. It has managed to kill over 5,000 people in the UK and over 50,000 people have been confirmed to of caught symptoms. It is a crazy time for many, including myself - Anxiety provoking due to having old family members with conditions such as COPD and stressful due to finishing a psychology degree. However, its given me time to feel gratitude for what i have in life.. my friends, my family, a roof over my head, an education, the beautiful world around me. I believe things happen in life for a reason, this reason is allowing the world to heal around us and to make people to be more mindful and to not take anything for granted. I am devastated for those who have loved ones who have lost their lives, homeless people living in fear on the streets, and the elderly living in fear wherever they may be. My love goes out to everyone at this heartbreaking time. The sun will shine on the other side!
