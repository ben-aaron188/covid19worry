I feel annoyed that  my life has  been taken away, I know it is justified but I'm habitual and am used to ease. Also there's a loss of life that I'm trying to accept this is a far greater tragedy, I wish it was over and I wish that at least the uncertainty would dissipate. I'm also disappointed by this government who can't communicate clearly but does this doesn't surprise me. What comes next causes me anxiety too as the world returns to normal life, we'll find out what the social and economic impact is.
