It is bad that it has gotten so bad especially since other countries were experiencing before it reached the UK. precautions should have been taken earlier.  so many lives have been taken and so many more are at risk especially those who are on the front line as it were.
now I'm stuck at home (high risk) for 10 more weeks.
However, the reason why I'm calm about it is I know worrying or living in fear make things worse. I'm not prepared to live that way. instead I have lined up some things for me to do and determined to turn this around for my good.
