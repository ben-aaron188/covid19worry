I am fairly safe in a secluded location, however I am very worried about the safety of my family and friends that live in big cities.
I worry for my pensioner parents as my dad has COPD yet they both still smoke and are doing daily trips to the shops for more cigarettes.
I am angry there has been so little investment in critical services and this is causing illness, stress and deaths that may have been avoidable.
I hope lessons have been learned and people that work in essential services are treated with far more respect.
