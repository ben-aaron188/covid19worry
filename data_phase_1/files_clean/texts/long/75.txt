I feel that there will be a big shift in how things are done on a global scale after this pandemic. Viral outbreaks occur occasionaly in some countries and are often ignored by western society. With this affecting the westernised world on a catastrophic scale, there is a lot of anxiety on how things will return to some form of normalcy, both socially and economic. I remain relatively calm and try not to stress on things that are out of my control. I feel this pandemic does highlight the flaws of a monetary system of society, governments are bidding against each other for supplies and countries are becoming more insular. I worry about the time ahead and I think this will impact the western world more as it was caught off guard and unprepared to take measures over profit in the early stages.
