I'm disappointed at our country's lackluster response so far and rather anxious about how much further this is going to escalate. I have had the virus myself and am now feeling much better so am more concerned about others than my own health, as I felt dreadful during it and can only imagine how it might effect those in poor health. I work in the care industry so obviously my number one concern is our residents, most of whom are extremely vulnerable. I have been isolating for the past two weeks and am due to return to work shortly, and hope that none of our residents have contracted the virus.
