At this current moment i am mostly worried about the corona virus affecting my friends and family who are more vulnerable to the disease. 

I am also slightly upset at the negative effects the disease has had on my time at university and how it has affected my education but i do understand the seriousness of the situation and that the calls made are justified.

I am slightly stressed out in the current situation due to the limiting effect that it has had on my daily routine but i am also enjoying the time i have at home with my family memebers.
