I am more worried about getting access to my normal healthcare at  the moment, than being concerned about Corona. My usual treatments have been halted, so my health will deteriorate even if I don't catch the virus!
I am struggling to get routine prescriptions and medical appointments, which is making me feel powerless and anxious.
I am also feeling very sad, as I can not see my children and grandchildren and can not celebrate birthdays and anniversaries with them.
I have been advised to stay inside my house for twelve weeks. The thought of this is making me unhappy, as all that I want to do is to go outside for a walk, but that is not possible right now.
