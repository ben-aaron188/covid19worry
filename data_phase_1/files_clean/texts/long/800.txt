The situation is being handled as best as could be I feel, with the circumstances of leaving the EU, and with the unknown about the real effects of the disease, so it's not really known if you could have it or not. Without a real break down of what coronavirus is and the exact symptoms and without tests, it causes alot of fear because of the unknown. People are scared of each other as well as scared of not having control over something of this scale. I am currently just worried about the people I care about, and people's jobs, because places closing down for months at a time won't be financially stable, so worrying to those who aren't currently key workers, and not currently working from home.
