It’s very worrying as you don’t know how long this is going to go on for, we think my grandad may have Covid-19 and also has COPD so we’re very worried for him. My children are bored and it’s causing a lot of strain at home so I’m feeling very stressed and I’m also 5 months pregnant so I’m worried about what this means for me when I have to give birth in August, I would like to have a home birth if covid-19 is still going around but at this moment in time my understanding is that they have put a stop to this due to staff shortage, I’m worried about not being about to have my partner and my mum there as I know I couldn’t do it without my mum.
