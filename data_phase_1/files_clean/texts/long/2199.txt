Currently I feel very anxious. I have a family member in the 1.5 million highly vulnerable people and itâ€™s terrifying. People still walking around like nothing is going on, having bbqs etc are making me angry and I wish everyone just got it, just understood. If we all did what we were supposed to do then maybe everything would be alright, but there are still those selfish people who think they are above everything and everyone else who are only going to make it worse. 

On a personal note I struggle with an eating disorder and the lack of routine is really making me relapse.
