I'm mostly feeling isolated, somewhat anxious about the situation for mine and my loved ones, and increasingly lost on what to do with my time. Quarantine has resulted in being separate from my long term partner due to her father being in a risk group, which probably doesn't aid my feelings of isolation. I respect the governments choices in these hard times and maintain a ''whatever will be will be'' attitude. In light of the extra time I've had, I've taken up and resumed several hobbies, all of which I enjoy and use to while away my time. A big concern for me is my career, as I worked in hospitality, and lost my job due to the outbreak. Beyond that i was searching for apprentice schemes to further my formal education, which has now been delayed by a not-insignificant period of time.
