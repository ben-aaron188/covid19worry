I feel the country would be better off if everyone stops being selfish and stays indoors. In addition to this police should patrol public spaces greater due to many still gathering at parks regardless of the laws enforced. Coronavirus is greatly affecting everyone especially those like me who live with a grandparent so have to be more careful when leaving the house in order to not bring it home due to old people being at a much higher risk of developing worse symptoms resulting in hospitalisation which puts a much greater strain upon the NHS.
