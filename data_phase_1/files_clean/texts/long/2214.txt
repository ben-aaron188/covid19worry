My job disappeared overnight and is likely to have gone for good. I have no idea what I will do next. Our government is lying on a daily basis, the Tories are claiming they are the NHS' best friends when they've been trying to sell it off for a decade. Virtue signalling is rampant - I don't applaud in the street because it helps no-one.

At the same time as most people are trying to stay indoors and follow the rules, a few people are shouting at those taking a daily walk in the park.

I can't get a supermarket delivery slot for my elderly parents, (in their 80s), yet I have friends boasting about 2 deliveries per week.
