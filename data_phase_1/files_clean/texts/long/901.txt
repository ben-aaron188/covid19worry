I'm angry because people are stupid, the government's incompetant, and capitalism is the source of all our problems. The world's a shithole. The rest of us who are abiding by the rules are suffering because of the ignorance of others. My exams were cancelled so that's years of work down the drain for nothing, and quarantine is making me wish I was dead. This whole situation could have been avoided if we werent under Tory rule because they've royally screwed up our country. I'm angry and I probably won't stop being angry about it for months or years to come.
