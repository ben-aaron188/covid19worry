I have anxiety about my future plans, like moving and my education. I worry about my job and finances. I’m happy to have time to relax and sort things out however, I don’t normally have enough time to do this so this makes me happy. I’m scared about losing loved ones but I’m grateful to see my parents more now I’m home a lot more. I miss my other family members and wish I could see them more often but I understand I cannot. I stress about how the economy and country will recover from this and the education system as I am still a part of this system and my grades will be affected because of this.
