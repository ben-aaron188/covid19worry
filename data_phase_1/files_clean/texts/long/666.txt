I feel anxious for my family who suffer from underlying health conditions but am not personally worried for my health
I feel cooped up inside the house due to restrictions on travel and this is severely affecting my mental health
but i do understand the necessity to stay inside the home and so am willing to follow the advice of the government.
but i do feel very hopeful and confident that this will pass very soon and everyone will be back to normalcy as soon as this is over. eventhough it is difficult currently to be isolated and worried about your family and their current situations
