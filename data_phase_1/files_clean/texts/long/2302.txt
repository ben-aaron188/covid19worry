Unsure, stressed, anxious, 
I love to surf (4 times a week) and live 2k from the beach, I can not walk to the beach as it is too hilly. We are told not to drive. I am unable to surf due to the driving and car park closures along with the stigma. It makes me feel incredibly sad, shaky and almost like an addict not going. I know I “could” go but my morals won’t let me as I an a key worker working with general public so I am more likely to have the virus and spread it to others. 
I have a family and the thought that I may be bringing it home to them also is causing me night mares. I work for a bank and really feel we are not key workers and banks should be closed.
