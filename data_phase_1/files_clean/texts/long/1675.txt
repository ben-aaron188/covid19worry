I feel that, as a couple, my wife and I are pretty safe. It's stressful though when she checks the news often. This is my only stress. On the good side I'm enjoying a much quieter lifestyle and it's great to see the levels of pollution reducing. I feel calm, relaxed, in love and that the situation is sad for other people more than myself. I ought to say though that it needs to be noted that I don't fear death.
On a national or global scale I feel the virus is in the balance, people are doing a great job of helping and caring on the whole but there are still people who are un-necessarily spreading the germs.
