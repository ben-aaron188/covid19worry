I am quite calm about it , but mostly annoyed at the government and how they are not dealing  with it. I am unsure if the main stream media are helping, and the hypocrisy towards the nhs from the media and government  is galling. Hopefully the social isolating will work, but we will not get back the 3 weeks lead we wasted.
Hopefully we will follow Italy's lead in a bit, but there is no real structure for an exit strategy to the voluntary lockdown.
There is a possibility that there will be a bounce when that happens if it is not handled correctly
