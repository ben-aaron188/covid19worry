I feel anxious about when this will end. I am worried about family members and miss spending time with them. I am upset about having to stop fertility treatment due to the outbreak and have no idea when it can start up again. It is already such an upsetting process over which you have no control and lots of long waits. I have problems with anxiety anyway and exercise and spending time outdoors in the countryside are the best things that help with this. I find it frustrating that my ability to do the things that keep me well are being affected.
