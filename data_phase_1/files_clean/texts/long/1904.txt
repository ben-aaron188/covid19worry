I feel anxious about what is to come and how this will plan out, the stress it has put on me financially is huge and has left me jobless with no way to claim. It’s an extremely sad time for everyone, those who are losing family and friends more so, but we’re trying our best to stay safe and isolated as hard as it may be. I suffer extreme anxiety when going shopping in case I’m not able to get the essentials, and I worry for my family and friends well being every day. I believe the government are taking correct action to help stop this virus, however people are still not listening so the rules should be made more strict, as reality still hasn’t hit home for a lot of people and maybe this will help that. I feel lonely, even though I am not alone, I miss my friends and my family, but I know this is in their best interest that we keep our distance.
