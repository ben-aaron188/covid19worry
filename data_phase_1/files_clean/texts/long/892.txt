Of course I am not happen about the situation og the world right now. people are not getting paid and so we have to manage our resources. what if we run out of money and resources. This situation makes it more difficult for those of us in search of job opportunities and its just really scary. I do hope God gets us all out of the situation soon cause i'm not happy to just be at home all day. Not to talk of the fear of contacting the virus as well. unfortunately non british citizens are not entitled to any benefits.
