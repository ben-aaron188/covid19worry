Very terrified, not for myself, but all my older loved ones and relatives who currently work in the hospitals. Terrified for the economy, how long will this lock down go? How many businesses will fail because of this? The anxiety is very hard when trying to live everyday when everyday thousands of people are dying from a disease that we have no real defense against. I'm very nervous about being able to pay bills in the future because I'm not sure if one day in the following months my job might end. The uncertainty of the situation makes me feel very uncomfortable. The only relief I have from the stress is knowing that many other people are feeling the same thing and that we are all in this together.
