I feel very worried, i know the figures have dropped in the UK but that worries me in the sense that we will come out of lockdown and a second wave will hit.

I really hate the lockdown and not being able to see my family or friends for over 3 weeks now has taken its toll on my mental health. Its hard when there is no end in sight.

I wonder what will happen if god forbid, boris dies. will the country carry on, will we all be too shocked to believe it? there are so many unknowns my anxiety feels very unmanaged at the moment.
