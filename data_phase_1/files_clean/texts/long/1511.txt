Annoyance at some people not social distancing which if they did could result us from being in lockdown sooner.  The situation around the virus seems very surreal in what the virus has managed to do creating an almost omega man film situation at times.  It seems that although I do not mind myself sitting at homenot seeing anyone in general, when you have no choice about it, it feels weird.  I find it strange also that people are automatically distancing themselves when you are out, but at the same time feel that you get to interact with someone and you are treated like a naughty child being told you are not allowed to do that, so go stand in the corner or go to your room and think about what you have done
