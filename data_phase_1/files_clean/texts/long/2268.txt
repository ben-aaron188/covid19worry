It is very scary, especially because of the vulnerability of my family, but it can be overcome, however it is scary and annoying to see youths still going out with their friends and people underestimating the severity of the disease especially to vulnerable people. Not only this but some people lie and think it is made up or are too engrossed in the politics and don't understand the normal people being affected by it, dying and being extremely subdued. However personally for me it is awful because of the regime and how difficult it is to adapt to living in isolation, not going out or seeing friends and family or loved ones, or being able to exercise properly or educate and the countless hours spent infront of a computer
