We are all at risk..it is like a lottery. Myself and my family are fearful and self isolating. We are even anxious about going outside, even for a walk and doing simple tasks like putting the bins out. We are lucky though to have a garden and to be able to order food online. I would like to do more and volunteer, but I have been advised not to on medical grounds. I feel fearful and helpless. I have felt all different emotions..anger at the government regarding ppe, sadness at watching news of people dying, fear that my family will get the virus, as I have elderly parents. I feel happy about the way the local community has come together at this time, and met people locally online, which zi would never have met previously. I have better understanding of charities and which ones are available in my area. I feel for the people who are alone at this time, and also larger families who are struggling to eat and dont have any space for the children, eg in high rises and BnBs, also for people who are unable to receive a high level of care at this time, those unable to progress with cancer treatment etc. I am very fearful as what is going to happen after the lockdown. The government does not have enough money to keep businesses afloat  after June time, so I believe money and economy will take priority over health. I believe we should self isolate for 6 months.
