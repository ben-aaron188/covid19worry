During the current Covid-19 situation that is happening world-wide, I feel apprehensive about the future and the economy. I am anxious about the impact the virus has on my family, and the potential seriousness of the virus on them. I worry about the country, specifically the UK, and the pressure that the NHS frontline staff are facing. I am angry that they are not given to access to the personal protective equipment that they desperately need to keep themselves safe. I am worried about their families and their exposure to the virus. I feel as though teachers are undervalued during this process as they are also caring to children of NHS frontline workers, which in turns puts themselves and their families at risk. I am disgusted that lots of high earning footballers are disputing that 30% of their wages should be sacrificed during the pandemic when there are so many workers in the country that have to be furloughed, sacrificing 20% of their wages, many of which won't be able to meet many demands of their lifestyle because of this.
