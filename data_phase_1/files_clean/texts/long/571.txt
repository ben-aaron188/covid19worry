Worried, and anxious. But with a background that we're broadly ok. Our income may not be too badly affected, we have enough to eat, we are healthy so far. I think my government is handling it badly, I worry for friends and family in health care. I worry that other things are also getting worse as we focus on this. 
This is 'a few sentences' I swear you didn't mention the 500 character requirement before. 
Fine. More? We're lucky to have a garden, so staying in our own space is a lot easier than it could be. We also share an allotment with another 2 families so we have *another* space we're allowed to go to. We keep chickens on it, so we have to go twice daily. I go in the morning (husband goes in the evening), and I think this routine is keeping me feeling more grounded than I might otherwise be.  I haven't been to the shops in 3 weeks - been making bread, already had milk and veg delivered weekly, I wonder whether I will be anxious about going when I do finally need to.
