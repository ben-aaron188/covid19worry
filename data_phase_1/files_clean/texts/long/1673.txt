I'm frustrated that the situation wasn't addressed more decisively earlier, but have to accept it is what it is.  The situation is also nice in some ways because I'm able to homeschool my daughter, and spend more time with her, but I would rather she were in school.  
I'm anxious for the health of my parents, who are elderly, as they have to be isolated and we do all of their shopping for them.  
My partner is very frustrated that she can't get out and about but is accutely aware that it's stupid to be out there and socialising or breaking the rules.  We are all adhering strictly to the government guidelines and are looking to do what's necessary.  
Personally, I miss the team and sporting activities that I would like to have been doing.  Also, I'm finding work is less productive than before and I'm one of those who falls between two stalls; I get nothing from the government but I appreciate the way that they have responded with financial packages that are relatively generous.
