I'm a little worried given such a grim outlook, but I'm trying to look at the positives, such as staying in and saving money, I'm still in a full time job when a lot of others aren't so fortunate, I've been reconnecting with friends & family that I haven't spoken to in a long time. All really positive things. I am quite concerned about the economy though, with some many now unemployed there's surely a recession coming. Also the loss of life, often unnecessarily, is very sad. People should stay in and then things will get back to normal a lot quicker. I don't even know what 'normal' means anymore.
