I am so worried how quickly this virus has taken hold .  it scary to see the death toll constantly rising and the pressure on the nhs. i really hoe that we fight it soon and we can all try and get back to some form of normality.  I wish that people would listen to the restrictions and stop putting us all in danger.  i am thankful that we are all together at home and safe.  I pray that all of our family and friends stay safe and dont fall victim to this awful virus.  I cant wait to meet up with all our friends and family and celebrate that we got through.
