I am more worried about my family and close friends than about myself. I feel quite anxious about my parents and other older members of my family. Furthermore my young child is at risk as well so I am avoiding all contact. I do feel scared most nights because I do not know what will happen to my family. Finally I feel the situation will become worse of the following weeks and I am unsure on how I will get food and medicine for my family. This frightens me quite a lot as delivery slots are all unavailable, which means I will have to leave the house to buy necessities.
