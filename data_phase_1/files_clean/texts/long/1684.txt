At the moment I have mixed emotions.

Anger at how the pandemic began. Anger at the people who are determined to carry on living as normal when the majority of us are sticking to the rules. My children want to see their grandparents and cousins and friends but they know they can't and the reason why they can't but it is difficult to explain when they see people continuing to play football etc.

I'm angry that my son has missed nearly half a year of school. That it took 2 months for y daughter to get into a routine for nursery and not scream every morning but we will have to start from square one.

I miss my work and my colleagues, I miss my friends and my parents and siblings. I'm upset that we have had to cancel our holiday.

I'm worried as my husband has to continue to work and risk bringing the virus home everyday for a low wage. I'm also worried that the lack of routine will have a negative impact on my mental health.

All my emotions do not matter when you think  of how many people have died worldwide  to this virus.
