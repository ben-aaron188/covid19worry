I feel anxious about next steps by the country as I have little faith in the government. I also worry for other places ie USA and Brazil where the government is inept and could see it spiral beyond control, ruining many lives.
I am however not worried about my immediate wellbeing due to self isolation.
I do have concern for food availability (not overall supply) due to difficulties in getting delivieries for many.
The general self isolation has me a little unhappy as I cannot even commute to work, but being able to exercise outside takes the edge off.
