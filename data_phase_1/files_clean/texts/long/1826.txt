I feel ok but just really bored. Want to go out with friends and family. I feel scared for me and my loved ones and just want it to al be over. I wish everyone would stay safe and follow government guide lines to make sure everyone is safe including their own families. I also miss going to work as the people I work with really are fun compared to Skyping everyday. I’m sick of the conversations as they all seem to revolve around the virus and the impacts on daily lives. 
I’m also concerned about the future, I’m thinking that as we have all been about to work effectively from home, this will become the normal
