In short, I feel a little worried as the world appears to be in a very strange place at the moment. That said, I believe there is light at the end of the tunnel. More with regards to numbers of cases/deaths appear to be dropping in certain countries. Which gives me, and should give the rest of the UK, some hope.. As long as we maintain doing as suggested/instructed by the Government/Health Authorities I feel the UK could be in a better place in a couple of months. Hopefully once the testing is ramped up and we get a better understanding of who has/hasn't had the virus, the Government/Health Authorities will be in a better situation to advise on the next steps. 

I do believe once this is over the world may be a different place for years to come, one example being; more people will be working from home. As the more of us that have had to realise this could now be an option. This would impact the amount of people having to commute and as a result the knock on effect could have an impact the transport industry etc.. 

Stay Safe!!
