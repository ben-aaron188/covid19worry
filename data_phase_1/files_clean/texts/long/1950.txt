I feel anxious thinking about the Corona situation and how it's affecting every part of people's lives. For me personally, I wouldn't say it's affected me that much, but when I think about everyone else, it scares me and makes me feel sad. People's mental health are worsening, people are losing money, people are dying. It's a crazy time that no one was really expecting. And to think about how this will probably last months is an even more worrying feeling. For now, I feel a little bit relaxed but my anxiety about the situation worsens every time I think of all the ways it's making things bad in the world.
