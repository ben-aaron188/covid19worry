I feel very anxious about my job and ongoing financial situation. I’m also concerned about my son who is working in a supermarket and whether he may come into contact with someone with the virus and get it himself. I feel fearful for the future at the moment. I worry that this will take the country years to recover from both socially and financially. I’m cross that people aren’t obeying social distancing rules which will make us have to endure lockdown for longer, I’m very proud of our NHS and thank staff daily for working through this. I admire their courage and strength.
