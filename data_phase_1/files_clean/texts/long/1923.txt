I am slightly nervous about it, more about the uncertainty than anything else. I want to know when lockdown will be over, and I want to know that the government really are doing all they can to increase medical resources.
Are we really just in isolation because there aren't enough medical supplies for us to be helped if we have corona?
I think the media are potraying too much information about it and we are not focusing on anything else in the news which is equally imporotant.
It's having a good effect on the environment.
