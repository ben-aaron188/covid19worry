I feel generally scared about my family. I saw talked to an old friend today and she told me that someone I know has been diagnosed with the virus so it has made it feel very real suddenly, and made me worry more for my mum and her health. I feel annoyed at people who are not following the social distancing guidelines and annoyed at the government for not doing enough. I also feel tired as all this worrying makes me sleepy! It has been a lovely day though so it has encouraged me to have a good walk which lifted my spirits.
