I am worried about my elderly family and family and friends who still have to go to work.
I am unsure of how my work will deal with being shutdown. Especially as they haven't given any information about how they are going to handle it. 
I have gotten used to not going to work and I am enjoying spending more time with my children and getting things done around the house and garden.
I'm not too bothered about not leaving the house. I have not left the house in over 2 weeks.
