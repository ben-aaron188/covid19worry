I am feeling anxious about the job uncertainty, the economy and the financial impact that the situation will be having on my family for some time to come. I am also very worried for my key worker relatives, especially my mother who is 60, I am slightly concerned about catching it as I'm pregnant and asthmatic. I am concerned about being able to get medication and food when my children are at home and I can't take them into the shops as well as who would be able to look after them if I was to become very ill.
