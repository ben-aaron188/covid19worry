I feel very worried and so unsure about the future and those of my loved ones. I cannot imagine life ever being the same again. I am not sleeping well, it all feels so surreal and like a never ending bad dream. I worry that we will never beat this virus. I think we have a lot to learn still about it. And what we thought we knew about it keeps changing. I no longer feel any comfort that my children will be fine if they get it. I worry what this is doing mentally to my children (age 10 and 12). Being isolated from their friends and normal ways of life is taking it's toll and it's only been 2 weeks. My elderly parents are not coping well. I need to help them more but other than leaving shopping on the doorstep and talking at the end of the phone I can't do anything for them. They need help in their home and the whole situation is just so hopeless and sad. And the worst of it is  , is the not knowing. Will it ever go away? Will we find a cure? Or will this wretched virus keep on getting stronger. Will we be all in and out of quarantine?
