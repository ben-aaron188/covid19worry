Trying to feel optimistic about future but checking the news every hour and not seeing any improvements is depressing. In general, I feel that UK is getting better in terms of fighting with virus and NHS seems like doing a really good job. Nevertheless, I fear of the virus to affect me. Not that it's gonna kill me but for the people around me. And I'm not sure how NHS would handle this. Would government take care of me when I'm in hospital? Not really sure of that. 

Not being able to work is another issue. I'm self-employed and came to London 10 months ago. Therefore I didn't pay the tax yet, fiscal year will be in May and I have to wait. I feel anxious how am I going to pay the rent next month since Government is covering only people who had tax returns. Now I'm in between 2 months, stuck and don't know what to do. This is sad.
