I feel a little stressed by it all, I would like to go outside and have my freedom back and just do normal things again. The issue of grocery shopping is a stress too, as it is almost impossible to get a delivery slot, so I may need to go to the supermarket, which is not exactly in keeping with the lockdown and social distancing.
It feels a little claustrophobic at times being stuck indoors.
I feel that it will take a lot longer than most people think to get back to normal, with a longer lockdown than anticipated.
