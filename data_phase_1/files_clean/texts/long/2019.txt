I am slightly anxious. My husband has asthma and I have two young children. I am a key worker so I am working every day with the public. There is the off-chance I could get it and bring it home . I use gloves and sanitising gel every day. For the first couple of weeks I didn't have sanitising gel so I used regular anti bacterial spray. I have messed up my hands but at least hopefully I haven't brough anything home. I am a courier, so I deliver 100 or so parcels a day. I have no idea who has touched them before me. Anoother issue I have is, if I get it I could pass it onto some of my customers!!
