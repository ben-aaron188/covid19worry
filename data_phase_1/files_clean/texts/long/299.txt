I think I have quite mixed emotions really. I am enjoying spending more time with my family. I don't really mind being stuck at home at all and I'm happy to use Facetime to chat with my extended family. On the other hand I'm really annoyed about the way NHS staff have been treated by the government and the hypocritical way they are being praised while being denied what they need to stay safe. I'm also quite fed up with social media and am making an effort to avoid it. There are too many people with misdirected anger - having a go at their neighbours.
