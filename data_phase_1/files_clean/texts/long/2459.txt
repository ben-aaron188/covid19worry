Feeling concerned about contracting COVID-19 as i believe i would be one of the ones hardest hit as well as my finanical situation once this is over which will take a hit. Feeling anxious about others, friends and family and people in the world who are suffering. Feeling disgust at politicans who play politics and think more about the economy rather than people lives and who make excuses and blame others. Concerned for health workers the world over and the lack of PPE and tests which keep dragging on. Worried that politcans who blame others including other countries will spark long lasting hostility once the virus has gone.
