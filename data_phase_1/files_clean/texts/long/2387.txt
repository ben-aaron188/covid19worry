In my opinion I believe that as long as everyone follows the current Government guidelines regarding social distancing then we should be back to our normal lives soon enough. I hope this happens sooner rather than later as I have recently had a new born baby son and my and my partners family have not been able to see him yet as well as all of our close friends. I am not too worried at the moment about contracting coronavirus as my whole family and I are following the government guidelines and are not unnecessarily coming into contact with other people.
