In general I'm confident this will be resolved over time, I'm annoyed that people continue to ignore government advice when I'm stuck at home and would very much like to go out and visit friends etc. Most of all I haven't see my girlfriend for a few weeks and that is becoming increasingly difficult.
I believe the NHS are doing all they can and we, as a nation should do everything we can to support them, which includes staying indoors unless completely necessary but people can't even manage this.
I understand this is a frustrating and scary time for everyone, from a selfish point of view I have my own worries about stuff like a holiday I have booked next week but I know in the grand scheme of things this is not as important right now.
