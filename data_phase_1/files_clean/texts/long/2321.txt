I've just heard about Boris Johnson being moved to intensive care so it feels very surreal and my anxiety has intensified. I feel unmoored and anxious. I don't see an end to this which is very hard to come to terms with. When i have delay with anxiety before i have told myself things are temporary and will change but this is hard in current situation. I am scared for my children and my parents but there is nothing that i can do. Sometimes it feels so unreal that i can disaasociate from it for a while but it soon creeps back.
