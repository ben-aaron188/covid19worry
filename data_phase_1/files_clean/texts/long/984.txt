I feel a strange mix of disappointment that we are in this situation due to not managing to contain the virus, frustration at a number of competing practical demands, and some excitement about some of the work I have had to stretch into. I've been working from home for years and been asked to share some expertise, as well as given new work producing media material and assisting groups of people to meet and communicate well online. I feel very lucky not to have been ill yet, and grateful that my wife, who works in a hospital, is able to contribute her talents and has also not yet been ill. I've been annoyed today that it does not seem appropriate to celebrate Easter with others in ways that we would like, and a bit guilty for focusing on our comfort at times when some of our neighbours may be short of basics and more worried than we are. I've also been feeling determined to make the most of trying to learn what we can from our situation, especially in terms of how we use technology better, now and in the future. I feel hopeful about the future.
