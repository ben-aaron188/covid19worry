I feel quite stressed about the uncertainty of this time and how it might affect my future. I also feel worried for the people I know who are more at risk than I am because I don't want them to get COVID-19 and end up in hospital or even die from it. I am also anxious that, being at university, I will be in a worse off situation for completing my degree as everything is so uncertain at the moment. Despite this, I am optimistic that we will get through this and that we will come out the other side with a new perspective and new values.
