It makes me anxious as there are still a lot of unknowns.  I'm also sad that I cannot see family and friends.  I am lucky that I can work from home and I am thankful for that, as so many cannot do that.  I would like to know how long we will  kept locked down but understand that it is difficult for that to be done.  I am trying to eat healthily and do exercise each day.  However, I am missing my usual activities.  So many things have been cancelled, and I suspect they are not finished yet.  I am in awe of the key workers and the NHS - they are truly amazing
