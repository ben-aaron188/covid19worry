I am 6 months pregnant, so I feel worried about the impact that getting the virus would have on me and the baby. My husband also has asthma so that is a concern too. I am worried about the impact that the lockdown will have on my ability to access the healthcare I will need when having the baby, and also about the exposure to the virus I will have to subject me and the baby to by accessing that healthcare in the coming weeks. I am also very worried for my mum who has quite a number of existing health conditions that put her at high risk, but also lives alone and suffers already with her mental health which has gotten much worse with this situation, and we are not able to offer her the usual support to make that better. There is just so much uncertainty about the future and what the coming weeks and months will hold for me and the people I care about.
