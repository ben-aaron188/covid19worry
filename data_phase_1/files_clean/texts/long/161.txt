It is sad that we are unable to visit family and friends at the moment and dont know when we will be able to again. I miss everyone very much. But I am lucky to live somewhere beautiful with amazing nature around me so I feel blessed and at times relaxed. I feel anxiety for everyone at danger, like key workers for example (and both my parents are ones) and frustrated with people that dont follow the rules. i would hope that our summer plans can resume to normal once the pandemic has calmed and everyone is much safer.
