Feel ultimately helpless and trapped, severely missing loved ones and the main thing seeing through this dark time is the plans of reunion we have.  Boredom is also greatly increasing by the day a feeling of annoyance is common as most days seem without a goal or purpose as the whole world is stopped and life is spinning its wheels. The whole situation and feeling is surreal constantly find myself reflecting on better times with a sense of unmitigated sorrow. The loss of life is staggering to even try to really compute the feeling that just another number to the figure is another life gone is harrowing.
