I'm angry that people aren't taking the current situation seriously, it's causing death and idiots to panic buy which is leaving others without. I have lost my job which is frustrating as I now have no income because of big companies not caring for us people who make them money. I wish I could go about day to day life but to protect others I will abide by the rules. I wish I could see my family but I must protect them as they are in the at risk group, I can't see my sibling which is upsetting too.
I want to see my friends but I can't use public transport to see them either so a video call to everyone must suffice for now
