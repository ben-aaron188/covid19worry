My wife has a small business working from home and has made no money in the last two weeks. I work in a food factory and the orders are very low. getting food delivered is all booked up we with just have to buy basics from local shops. I'm due to get a blood test and am worried about getting one. I'm a type one Diabetic and am very worried about getting prescriptions. My kids are off school, my daughter had her GCSES cancelled and was very upset because she has been studying very hard for nothing. And her last year of secondary school was cut short with no celebration.
