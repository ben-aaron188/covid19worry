I am feeling very sad  for all the families who have lost loved ones. Also I am concerned about my husband who is a vulnerable person along with my mother and mother in law. i am not concerned about myself as i have to go shopping. I am hopeful that all the sacrifices we are making will beat this virus and so grateful to all the amazing NHS staff including my bother in law and sister in law who are on the front line that they are safe. I am very impressed with the way the government is handling the pandemic. We can win this.
