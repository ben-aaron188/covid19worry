I am worried, worried I am going to get it and pass it on to others which could cause people I love to die as well as others in my local area. 

I work at a supermarket and have to keep going to work and interacting with members of the public, I am trying my best to stay clean to stop the spread but its hard, and I worry. 

I worry that I could catch this virus from a person in the shop, then I spread it to my family who lives at home with me, and it worries me that my family are at risk and if they do not know they have it, they could give it to my older members of the family when they bring the shopping over, which could cause these people I love to die. 

And that worries me. A lot.
