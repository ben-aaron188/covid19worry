It’s annoying being stuck at home, but if it helps the situation and protects me and my family then it is well worth it.  I just wish that everyone would adhere to the social distancing and lockdown rules so that they don’t spoil it for everyone else and potentially aid the spread of the virus. I do love the way the country comes together at times like this though, a community spirit comes out of the closet that has disappeared in many parts, the support for the NHS and been immense and the clap on a Thursday night is something that brings a tear to my eye, a nation brought together, unfortunately by this wretched virus. Try Covid-19, but you will not defeat this great British nation.
