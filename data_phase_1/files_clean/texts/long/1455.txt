At this very moment, my feelings are mainly of an anxious nature. Due to the unknown, what's going to happen to any of us. This may be due to the health of myself, my family, my friends etc. or it may be due to security (job, house etc.)

I am also feeling slightly angry with how certain people have reacted to this outbreak, whether it's their racist acts/comments towards others, or simply their lack of respect of everyone else, flaunting the rules without a care of anyone else.

I haven't once felt sad throughout the outbreak.
