I am bewildered to be honest. Anxious about my parents and loved ones, less worried about myself. Isolation doesn't bother me, a lack of routine coupled with uncertainty does. I'm not convinced that one period of lockdown is going to work, especially when you see a return in China. I don't understand how some people are still not taking it seriously and are still socialising. I worry about the economy and the loss of front line workers. I think this could take decades to come back from and working life and expectations will be different from now on. I miss human touch.
