I'm scared that I may lose loved ones or my job. I'm scared I may lose the roof over my head. I'm scared that life isn't going to be as we know it even when the lockdown uplifts. I feel a global economic downturn worse than we have ever seen before is on the way and we are just not prepared for this. I hope that I am able to see my family soon and that people stop being selfish and see this as a holiday.
I hope that the death toll reduces and that more people's families and lives are not affected too severely.
