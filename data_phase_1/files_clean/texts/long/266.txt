I feel frustrated that the government is relying on corporations to do right by their employees, when most will be trying to minimise profits rather than protecting staff. I feel scared at the prospect of catching it or my loved ones catching it. I feel resentful at those that get to stay home safe while I have to go to work and put myself at risk. I feel worried about my friends who may not do well when socially isolated, but I don't have the strength to help them. I feel grateful to so many who are appreciating the NHS and are sticking to the guidelines, not leaving their houses.
