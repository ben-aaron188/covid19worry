I worry about he state of my childrenâ€™s education when they all go back to school. I am also very worried about my parents and other vunerable relatives trying to keep them safe and at home as some do not realise just how serious the situation is. I am very anxious about leaving my youngest child at school mixing with other children as I have to work, as does my husband as we are both key workers. I am trying to keep positive about everything as trying to look tern, what are the positives we can take out of the situation.
