I am concerned about the strain on the NHS and how this may affect my pregnant wife, currently guidance suggests i will not be able to attend appointments. I am worried and concerned that this crisis may continue to the birth date and this will make organising care for our other daughter difficult and may prevent me attending the birth.

This is especially difficult because the birth of our first daughter did not go as planned and my wife has suffered a serious health issue as a result. This worries me and makes me anxious, but I am hopeful that the peak of the virus is now with us and things can quickly get better in the coming weeks.
