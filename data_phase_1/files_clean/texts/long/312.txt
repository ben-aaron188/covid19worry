Fearful of what it to come and worried about how it will affect my family. Both in regards to their health, especially my parents and how it will affect my immediate family financially, my husband has been asked to take a 20% pay cut and will will struggle. However we are in a better position than many as at the moment he keeps his job. What will happen when the crisis is over though is undefined as far as his employment is concerned.
For the first time I fully support Boris Johnson and the policies put in place by the British government, I am thankful that our leadership appears to be basing their response on scientific data and common sense which appears to be wholly not the case, particularly for countries such as the United States and more extremely Belarus. Inappropriate decisions by governments will cause more people to die.
