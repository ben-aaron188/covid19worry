Concerned for my Mum who lives aay from me and how she will cope if this situation goes on for weeks/months.
As I still have to work I'm also concerned that I may pickup the virus as I work in a very busy place wjhere it is very difficult to manage social distancing. Not sure what else to write.,
Also want the pubs to open again soon as I really miss socialising with my friends.
