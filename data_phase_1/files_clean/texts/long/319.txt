I think I am fine, but also I feel the inability to concentrate within my own home whilst doing university work. I have tried to support the NHS by volunteering for several positions, and in the hope to use up by time more productively. Sometimes, I have days where I dont have that much to do, but I have a constant to do list which I keep working on. I feel sadness for the many people who have lost their lives in these tragic times, and quite scared for the times which are ahead of us. I am afraid we have not reached the worst peak yet. i also sometimes find it scary that countries are not listening to each other, for example Sweden. I recently, have been forced to return to the UK after being on ayear abroad for my university, and Sweden still functions as normal. i am worried they may turn into countries similar to Italy.
