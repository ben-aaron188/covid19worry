I feel a little bit worried about how long we will be in lockdown for as a lot of businesses will go bankcrupt. The health of the majority of the country could seriously deteriorate and people will probably develop mental health problems from staying in all day which makes me feel concerned.

There is also a Great deal of uncertainty about when the restrictions are likely to end which causes me to feel a little anxious and nervous.

I feel concerned about the elderly population including my parents who are both in their 70â€™s and not in the best of health currently.
