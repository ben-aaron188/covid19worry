I  am feeling  ok  about the virus at the moment. I am a key worker so am at risk sometimes but it goes with the territory so i am not phased by the threat.The only thing that annoys me is the stupidity of others and their behaviour e.g Not staying at home, stock piling of essentials and basic food stuffs or observing social distancing in a responsible manner. i feel there should be a stricter lockdown in force as the minority of people cannot be trusted to observe the restrictions so we should have a zero tolerance attitude in place
