I feel anxious and sad about the coronavirus and situation particularly with respect to the number of deaths that are occurring as a result of the outbreak. This makes me feel scared about my wellbeing and the wellbeing of my friends and family. The fact that this situation is something completely out of my (or most people's) control also makes me feel frustrated and helpless. This makes dealing with the situation more difficult for me. I think that the lockdown measures imposed by the government are the right thing to do but I do find them difficult and they have had an affect on my personal mental health.
