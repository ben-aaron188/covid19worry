I feel annoyed that people are not following lock down procedures. I'm not worried really about it, but I think this is due to me not knowing anyone who has been affected by covid-19. I am slightly sad as I miss my friends and my university course got cut short and it is my first year. I am enjoying spending quality time with my family and lock down has also given me an excuse to start exercising and watching my diet as I have nothing else to do. However, it has affected my work as I can't find the effort to start my university work.
