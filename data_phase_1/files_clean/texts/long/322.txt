The sun has been out today and have managed to be quite productive with my work (hasnt been the case over the last week) so am actually feeling quite content, as long as I don't think about the world outside my 'bubble' - house / garden / husband / dog / immediate locale.
If I allow myself to think outside the bubble i very quickly cycle into a downhill of extreme anxiety and fear, for myself (high risk), my parents (both high risk), grandmother  .... I miss seeing my sisters desperately - they live in the same small town as us ... I feel quite at a loss with my work - totally overwhelmed by the implications of it all i am finding it hard to move forward or make any decisions beyond the day to day
