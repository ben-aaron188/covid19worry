I am vunerable been told i have to stay home for 12 weeks i already suffer anxiety and panick attacks so im very afraid also brought on with continues cleaning continues washing my hands now an obsession. Although i will do all that is asked of me stay home etc im worried for my family friends and am crying most days . I am also very angry that i cant order the shopping i need i dont want family to go out incase they get sick and finally got order and there was no essentials left. IT SEEMS THAT NOTHING IS GETTING DONE BY THE GOVERMENT AND IM VERY WORRIED THAT THEY HAVE JUST LEFT US ALL TO IT NO DIRECTION AT ALL PLUS THEY LEFT EVERYTHING TO LATE
