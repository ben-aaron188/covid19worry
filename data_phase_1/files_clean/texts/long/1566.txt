I'm feeling quit relaxed right now but worried that it might still get worse. Getting kinda bored now as well missing the outside and friends. At that is it really. I also feel that the media is quite harsh on china even tho they are doing better than the countries like Italy and USA. I also feel that the USA is taking a real bad approached just like  is Italy is. The people that are taking this not so very seriously are quite silly and are putting other people in quite a bit of danger and also the NHS in danger over over load
