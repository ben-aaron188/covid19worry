I feel anxious because so many people continue to flout the clear rules and government guidelines put in place. To know that these people could be putting my loved ones at risk is the most upsetting part. I'm not too concerned about my personal situation, as I think I may have already had a mild version of COVID-19. It's the effect that strangers' selfish actions could have on my loved ones which is the most distressing aspect of this situation. Doing things like working from home and self isolating don't bother me too much, it's just an odd change of routine that I know is for the greater good.
