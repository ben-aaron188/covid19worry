I still feel happy and upbeat in general, but the situation is always on my mind. Life has changed completely and I feel pretty fearful about how easy it would be to catch it. There is a feeling of sadness and seriousness around everyone I know.

I am trying not to worry my child, I want to protect my family. I have never felt so worried about them all.

Day to day life is quite frantic trying to juggle everything especially now the schools are closed.

I also like the way it has united us and brought us closer together as we fight for the same things and share the exerience.
