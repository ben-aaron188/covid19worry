From a medical point of view, I am not concerned for myself. I am worried about elderly relatives, in particular my mother and grandmother. 

I am feeling anxious about the financial implications later in the year. I don't know whether my company will be forced to make redundancies & this will be very difficult to manage. 
 
I feel sympathy for those who are more greatly affected than me and gratitude towards those who are on the front line.  

I dislike all the bile and anger on social media towards the government. Of course mistakes will be made, but nobody would handle such a situation perfectly.
