Well my life is fairly normal as I’m still working. But obviously it’s full of Anxiety and apprehension about doing things and not being able to see family. It’s the most worrying seeing news posts everywhere and being that so many different people and news outlets are reporting on it you don’t know who’s information is 100% accurate and what to believe! The other thing is that not everyone is following the lockdown rules and that obviously isn’t a good thing and is how the virus will be around for a lot longer and infecting a lot more people that it needs to.
