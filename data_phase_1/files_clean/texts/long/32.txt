I think the government should have put precautions in place much earlier to avoid the current situation in the UK.
I do miss my friends and family and get so anxious with isolation in general so this is really damaging my mental health.
It's scary and I just want the nightmare to be over so I can go back outside and be happy again.
My boyfriend lives in The Netherlands and it's so hard having the restrictions with flights etc. as he makes me happy but I understand why they have been put in place. 
At the end of the day, everyone should be trying to keep eachother safe and limit the death toll as much as possible.
