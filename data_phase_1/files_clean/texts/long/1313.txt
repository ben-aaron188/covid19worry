annoyed firstly that this has been allowed to happen in modern times..annoyed the way some people mostly younger have not taken warnings seriously enough..concerned the way government ls have struggled to act quickly when the china warnings were there to see in January ..worried the way PPE has not been made readily available a lot quicker for the front line staff..sad the way it has killed so many people..hopefully we will learn enough over the coming months to stop this ever happening ever again
