After having been in lockdown/isolating at home etc. for more than 2 weeks, I feel like people are only just beginning to take Coronavirus seriously. I feel a little bit angry/resentful towards people whom haven't taken it seriously or whom have been ignoring the lockdown, and thus putting themselves and most importantly other people at risk.
I feel quite bored and restless, having had to stay at home for so long, however I think this is a small price to pay to help minimise the impact of the virus. I also feel a bit anxious about the whole situation, particularly as I live with my 2 parents, both of whom would be classified as more vulnerable to severe symptoms if infected with Coronavirus. They rely on me to do their food shopping etc., which is not a big problem, however I feel a strong responsibility to ensure I don't take any risks myself, due to the fear of infecting them.
Having been furloughed just 3 days ago, I'm also somewhat worried about the impact of the Coronavirus situation on my job as an offshore oil and gas worker, and I'm afraid of possibly not having a job to go back to once the situation does recede to a point where people can return to work etc.
