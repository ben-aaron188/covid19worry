Very worried about the affect on jobs and the economy. It will take a long time before things clear up, things may never return to normal. There will be long lasting social and economic scars from all of this. World leaders were clearly not prepaired for a crisis on this level. I worry aobut my parents as they are in the higher risk age. I worry about those out of a job or trying to find a job in this time.  The government is not doing enough, especially those self-employed or running a small buisness.
