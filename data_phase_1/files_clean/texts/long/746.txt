I feel really anxious about the situation; I'm worried for my parents and their health, as well as people still working in hospitals. I feel like we're in limbo, like we can't plan anything, which I think makes me feel more anxious and tense. I'm angry knowing some people aren't following the social distancing rules correctly but I also feel like an arse when I'm calling them out because everyone is in a difficult position right now. I'm feeling fairly lost when I think about it, and I'm also feeling anxious about showing my parents how worried I am about them.
