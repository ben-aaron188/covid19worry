3 weeks today I had my last shift in the office I work at. The next day I went in to get my belongings and haven't been back since. I haven'r seen my friends since then, I feel very lonely. Talking to them via Zoom helps but it doesn't feel right. I am finding it hard to have a work life balance too, either I am spending way too much time working or not enough. I always feel scared to go shopping incase I can't get what I want but it's getting better now. I hope all of this ends sooner rather than later. I try and walk daily but I am finding it hard to find the energy to.
