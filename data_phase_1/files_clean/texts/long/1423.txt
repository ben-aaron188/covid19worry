I am getting more concerned by the day. I am out getting essentials at the moment and I've had to wait an hour in a queue so I'm frustrated! I am concerned that I cannot get hold of a mask anywhere that I see so many people wearing them. Today people have been visibly affected, showing their anger and frustration inside the shops. I have been admonished on two occasions in the shop I am currently in, by shop assistants who are barking orders at me. I am frustrated because each shop seems to have different rules, therefore making it difficult to follow their individual protocol.
