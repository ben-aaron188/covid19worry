It is worrying for the country as a whole and at the very least, someone I know will be deeply affected by this. However, I believe my vulnerable family and friends will take the necessary precautions so I am not worried too much about that. My university have taken appropriate measures so that I am not too stressed about exams and work coming up. Lockdown isn't too boring or stressful for me as I don't mind being inside and going for solo exercise. I think the government are dealing with it all reasonably well and people shouldn't criticise too much regardless of their political views. Obviously, I admire all the NHS workers and it does make me angry seeing absolute twats ignoring the rules of lockdown that could have a severe effect on all of us. I am quite gobsmacked by this.
