It's a scary situation we are currently in as you see in the news the amount of people that have died so far due to this. Can affect anyone from people with underlying condition to healthy individuals. Would like this to be over and done with. Annoyed at the fact there are people who are not following the government's advise and are going outside, and not staying indoors. Due to this it's going to take a longer for the coronovirus to peak down. Scary reading about not being enough hospital beds and ventilators available so may not be able to treat everyone. I feel the government has let the people down on testing and how the frontline key workers won't all be tested to see if they had the virus or not.
