I'm very anxious and scared of the situation due to having vunerable family and friends. I'm also quite lonely, and am struggling with the lack of human contavt. I miss the routine of daily life. I just want it all to be over, so things can go back to normal. Feels like everyday the things that are happy seem to stop making me so. I'm getting more bored and irritable. I hate it. I'm also getting bored of the basic food we have in, but obviously we can't get hold of luxuries or anything like that
