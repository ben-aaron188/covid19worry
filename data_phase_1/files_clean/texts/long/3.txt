I feel fed up with waking up and doing the exact same thing everyday. I feel frustrated that there's nothing I can do about it. I feel anxious about what is going to happen over the coming weeks. I feel angry that some people seem to be ignoring the rules based on what I've seen on the news - if I am going to be spending my birthday on my own and not seeing half of my family or any of my friends, then what gives others the right to picnic in parks as if lives aren't ending every day? It is a really frustrating situation. However, I also feel excited when I think of the lockdown lifting and being able to see my boyfriend again.
