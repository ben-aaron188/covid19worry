I'm not too worried about myself, more for certain vulnerable people close to me.  I'm trying to minimise our risk but the actions of others around me, especially shopping in supermarkets, makes this very difficult and makes me angry.  People get too close and I worry about their hygiene habits.  Other than in that environment, I'm not too worried about contracting the virus.  But it's frustrating not being able to influence the behaviours of others.  More testing is essential as soon as possible.
