I am worried about the current situation. I feel anxious most of the time although I do try to keep myself busy around the house and try to keep a positive mind. I try not to dwell too much on the situation because there is nothing I can do to change it. I am not sleeping well at all. I am having vivid dreams and wake repeatedly in the night. I can't concentrate on things during the day like I used to be able to do. I am worried about myself and loved ones catching covid but I'm also worried about needing other medical help and the services not being available to help us due to being busy with covid. I am worried about the mental impact on my children and their physical well being due to lack or excercise. I am also worried about the impact on their education.
