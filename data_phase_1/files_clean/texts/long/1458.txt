I feel worried. I'm scared for my family and myself. I'm angry at how people are still stock pilling food and how the idiots don't understand we are not supposed to be going out. All we have to do it stay in which most people would love to do yet some idiots don't understand how the longer they disobey rules the longer we will be like this. I wish people would listen more and help eachother. I'm worried about university and how we don't know what will happen next year, or even if we will start again this year.
