i am worried about my family, and not being able to see them as much as i would like. 
apart from contacting them through phone calls and video calls i rarely see them at the moment.
my workplace is exercising extreme social distancing measures so i feel comfortable going there, and my wages haven't been affected so i'm okay with this situation.
I feel anxious about people standing too close to me in shops though but i do try shop in the 'vunerable hours' due to having Multiple sclerosis.
the distancing measures in shops is excellent if people would actually adhere to them, one way systems are great too,
