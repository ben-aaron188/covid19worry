I feel quite worried because my mum would be considered falling under the category of at risk. I myself would too as I have asthma however, I am more concerned for her than myself. I therefore will be working from home for at least twelve weeks regardless of lockdown rules which I do not mind so much but as someone that struggles with mental health issues and lives in a small flat, I am concerned that in perhaps a months time my mood will decline significantly. The sense of community I have seen online and on the news is encouraging and welcoming however, and gives me slightly more hope in a more loving, caring society after the severity of this situation calms down.
