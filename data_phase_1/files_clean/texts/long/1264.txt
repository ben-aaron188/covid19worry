Currently, I am feeling quite relaxed and content as self-isolation due to COVID-19 hasn't impacted my life in the slightest as of right now. But I do have slight anxiety about the possibility of being infected with it and passing it on to a vulnerable person, especially a family member who I currently live with that is elderly and therefore more susceptible to the virus. Globally, I am optimistic that we will recover from this pandemic in a couple of months time when a vaccine is developed, or at the very least control the situation better than we are doing now.
