I feel like the fear and paranoia is increasing week by week. I go through phases of feeling quite relaxed and enjoying the peace, to feeling very anxious and on edge about the situation, as more news comes through every day of the reality, it keeps jolting us back to being terrified. Any normal day activity outside the house like getting medicine from the pharmacy leaves you incredibly paranoid. People are being very kind though and it seems to have united the nation. I worry more about my family members than i do myself. I think a lot of the anxiety is about not knowing when the situation is going to end, rather than the isolation itself.
