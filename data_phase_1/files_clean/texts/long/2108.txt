I feel uncertain about how long this will last and what the impacts on society will be in the longer term, both economically and socially.  I also feel sad about the negative impact on people's physical and mental health, especially for the families of those who have and who will lose relatives to the virus.  In addition I feel unsure about the effectiveness of the government's response to the crisis and whether our healthcare infrastructure will be robust enough to cope with the volume of ill patients we expect.
