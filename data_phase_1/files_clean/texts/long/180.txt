Currently feel mentally and physically drained - it’s caused really bad anxiety as it’s very unnerving not knowing if you or family will contract the virus and not being able to hug and see family is so difficult. Currently working at home but so hard to focus and have motivation to carry on with work based topics when partner is furloughed which is an financial strain and balancing boredom. Beginning of lockdown was excited to get things done in the house but also due to lockdown are unable to get any items in particular fence paint. I get really heightened anxiety at the thought of going food shopping during this time.
