* I feel helpless on the situation 
* It angers me that people are not taking the social distancing instructions seriously. There has been news of people having picnics in parks and soaking up the sun. However, it is selfish and people are out there dying. There are NHS staff who are dying caring for people. People are taking advantage of the situation. 
* I am saddened by the news of people passing away
* I am feeling anxious every time I step outside in case somehow I touch my face/mouth without realising. 
* I feel scared to leave the house for work in case I bring something back as my mum is at a higher risk
