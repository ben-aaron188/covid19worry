I feel a little worried about how bad it might get, but on the whole I feel fine, and know that it will be over in the long term. I mostly worry for the health of vulnerable relatives, both in terms of corona virus and their mental health in regards to isolation. On an individual level I am not so worried at all. Isolation seems to be fine on my own mental health, but living in my confined space within a flat share is a bit stressful. This mostly comes from being near my flatmates for such a prolonged amount of time, which I am not used to.
