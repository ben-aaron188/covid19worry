Corona does not worry me that much per se - one can die from the cancer, stroke or heart failure anytime so additional risk does not affect me much. Initially I checked the websites that track corona cases/deaths multiple times per day, but by now I probably got used to the situation and become less concerned. I am worried a bit about my older relatives, but they seem to be even less concerned than I am.  
I am more concerned with longterm economic consequences of the situation because I am the only breadwinner in the family.
I live rather solitary life, so my daily routine almost did not change. I hope things become better by summer.
