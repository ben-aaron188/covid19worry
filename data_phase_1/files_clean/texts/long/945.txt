On a personal level, even though my job seems to be secure for now I feel general anxiety. I can work from home but the whole company needs some time to get used to this new situation. Hearing about how others are trying to cope and talking about it makes things easier.

I have mixed feelings about the global situation. Eventually, we will get through this, but it seems like some governments are only concerned about bailing out companies from this and leaving individuals in a dire situation. The economy will be fine, eventually, but people, families might not be. And that makes me anxious.
