Not very concerned about the situation. But still anxious about everything concerning it. Worried about catching it and nervous about how little was initially done about the virus to start with. Nervous about having to keep going out and getting shopping or go to get medication etc. And a little angry about how lackadaisical others have been about it.  The government was especially bad with the start of the outbreak, especially with it travelling across the world to get to the UK and having time to prepare and have prior knowledge of those already infected and still being slow to react to it is disappointing.
