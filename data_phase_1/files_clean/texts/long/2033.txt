I am a little worried . I try to stay inside and limitate my time outside . 
I only get out when I go shopping . 
I am a little worried about how the government handled the situation . They don't make enough tests so nobody knows the real numbers of infected people . They don't desinfect the streets , they don't do anything about people who stay outside everyday , go to parks , have parties . I am a little disappointed.
Many other countries handled everything much better . 
I try to respect the rules but it is not fair when nobody does that and the authorities do nothing about it .
