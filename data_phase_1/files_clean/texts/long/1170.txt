I feel very nervous and on edge at this current moment. I am unsure of the future and am not sure how much longer I can deal with being stuck indoors. I also feel very caged in and claustrophobic being stuck inside with my family. I'm irritable and need time on my own but asking for it offends my family members and creates tension between us. I'm tired as well and in need of the routine of my day to day working life. I miss my work friends a lot and I miss my independence and freedom. I just hope this situation doesn't last too much longer although I fear it will and that worries me immensely.
