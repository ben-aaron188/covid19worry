I am worried about my mother and partner who are both high risk. I am sill owing regulations and trying to “do the right thing” and help them, but I feel powerless.

I also feel isolated from my parents and siblings as I am unable to see them. Video chat is ok, but I miss human contact with them.

I am also worried about my financial situation after being furloughed from work. There is no end date and that worries me.

I am overwhelmed as I feel like I have little control at the current moment.

My pre-existing anxiety is very high and I wish I could find more ways to calm my nerves.
