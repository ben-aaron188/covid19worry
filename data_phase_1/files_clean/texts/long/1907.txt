The Corona situation is difficult for those who wish to gather for religious festivals, such as those who go to the mosque during Ramadan. Mosques may be closed during Ramadan. Other places of worship may be closed during their religious festivals. It's also difficult for those who can't work at this time or can't go to school. The government should have handled this better by responding more quickly to the coronavirus situation. The UK government needs to provide more help to those who are experiencing financial difficulities. The coronavirus situation has also highlighted the need for good healthcare, so governments should spend money on good healthcare rather than wars. I hope that the coronavirus will stop spreading soon.
