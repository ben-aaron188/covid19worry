I feel anxious constantly but it’s in the background. Today has felt better because I’m not at work so it’s not been at the forefront of my mind. If I think about it I can’t quite get my head around it all. I feel scared that it’s going to get or that someone I know could get it. Initially I wasn’t too worried but now people are dying and it scares me to think someone I know could actually die from this. It’s just so surreal and unbelievable. I work in a hospital so I hear about the realities of the situation. This doesn’t help my anxiety but at the same time I want more information
