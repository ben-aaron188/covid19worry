I think that the British Government acted very slow to the realisation that COVID19 was such a big problem. I think the UK could have nipped it in the bud and done something sooner rather than strain the NHS so much as it is now. 
I feel anxious about who could get it and anxious for my parents who are over 60 and have previously had pneumonia. It frustrates me about the people who do leave the house and don't take social distancing into consideration. when i graduate i hope to work in the NHS and from what i know already, working in healthcare is already so difficult, let along at this really hard time.
