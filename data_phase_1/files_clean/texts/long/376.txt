I'm not worried about the effects of Corona on my personal well-being, but I'm concerned about the long-term economic consequences of mass quarantine. I find it frustrating how scared and anxious most people seem to be because of Corona, even though it poses little to no threat to the majority of them. I think the current measures meant to stop the spread of the virus will do more harm than good in the long run, because life can't just stop for several months. I do, however, appreciate the new opportunities to spend more time by myself at home, including working from home (which I've never done before).
