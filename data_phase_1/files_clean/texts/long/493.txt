I feel anxious about the changes that are taking place day by day, in the economy, in the political situation and how we all interact socially. I fear for the state of the world once the crisis is over and how life may be, I am concerned that life may be more challenging in a financial sense and that the progress of life, the world of education and work may be a lot more challenging than before. 

I do however have hope that this situation will allow the governments of the world and all individuals to take stock of how they live their lives and conduct themselves and hopefully reflect and improve.
