I feel anxious for my older relatives as they have underlying health conditions, and about my mental health as I suffer from depression and anxiety and don't know what I will be like over the next few months.
I am fearful over not knowing when everything will go back to normal.
I feel sadness at not being able to go to university, socialise with friends or leave my house when i want.
I am worried about my financial situation as I cannot work during this time.
Lonely as I live alone and cannot be in physical contact with my family or friends.
