The main emotions I feel right now are confusion and frustration. I have information overload with all the news outlets saying different things. You have one person saying one thing and another saying something totally different. There are a lot of rumors going around to the validity of the certain pieces of information. I'm missing my family, I haven't seen my mum for nearly a month. I haven't seen my friends for a long time. I'm not really a sociable person but this has brought to light how much I really miss them. My routine is all out of sync which makes me feel lost and extremely lazy. Very strange times.
