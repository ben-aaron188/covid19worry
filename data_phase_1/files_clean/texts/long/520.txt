I feel like I really don't like the uncertainty about it. it makes me anxious. I don't like not knowing when I will see my boyfriend and friends again and I don't like not being at uni. I'm getting bored at home and worried that my impatience will make me irritable and frustrated with my family. I am trying to remain grateful for a garden space and a supportive stable family. I am anxious for my grandparents who are much older, and feel good when I shop for them to help them out. my uni exams make me really worried as they will be online and I am struggling to stay motivated to keep on top of work. I am generally unmotivated to do much, but hate being bored.
