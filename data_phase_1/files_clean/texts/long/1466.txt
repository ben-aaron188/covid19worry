I’m currently a suspected case of Coronavirus so I’m very anxious. I am recovering at home but it gives me great anxiety to constantly see deaths on social media and the news, especially of young people around my age.  I’m extremely worried about the rest of my family and at this present time I’m stressed about how long this will go on for and how long I’m not allowed to see my elderly mother. I’m also slightly angry at the people continually not listening to the governments advice and are out and about.
