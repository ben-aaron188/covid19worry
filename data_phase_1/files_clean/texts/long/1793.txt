I feel worried and anxious, more for family and friends than myself. I would feel very helpless if I couldn’t be there for them. I worry for the front line staff doing a difficult job. I get angry at the business’s refusing to close as they sell a couple of tools therefore count themselves as hardware for example, putting profits before staff. I am angry at the minority of people who are risking the liberties of the majority and annoyed that the government is refusing to ban outdoor activities when that maybe the only way. I am also worried every time I go the the supermarket and take every precaution I can to prevent infection but as an asthmatic I am slowly getting paranoid about it. I know this is going to take a long time to resolve but I worry about just how long this will take and what our lives will look like afterwards.
