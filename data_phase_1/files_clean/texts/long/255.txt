The corona situation at these times is very difficult but it helps us find ourselves again and slows down humanity allowing everyone to reflect.People going out have only themselves to blames for contracting the virus. It does make me feel slightly scared that people are ignorant and don’t listen strictly to the rules. Also it is threatening for the economy as people aren’t working and Markets have fallen in value. However the positive is it allows people of all religions to pray and focus on God and allow others to spend more time on immediate household family and get work done they might not have been able to do due to work etc. Allowing us all to actually come together as a nation is warming and shows the power of humans if we all unite
