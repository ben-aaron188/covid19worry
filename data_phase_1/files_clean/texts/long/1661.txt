I feel scared and anxious about the situation, and generally not knowing when this is all going to end. I hate that we can't do our usual daily tasks, or see friends and family, and I am also quite worried about my job - as for now my workplace is closed (temporarily) but who knows what will happen if this continues. It's obviously the best thing but it worries me that over time, it will be less and less likely that we will be able to get back to normal. I don't know what else to really say that I haven't already said
