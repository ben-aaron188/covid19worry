I am angry at the way the situation has been handled by those with power. the vulnerable and non-wealthy people are not considered a priority by right wing and libertarian people with power and so we will be left to die or suffer the economic consequences of the pandemic. 

the pandemic its self is a natural thing and can't be blamed on anything but the official responses have been damaging and narrow minded by countries like the UK and US. 

I am hopeful that the virus will be contained soon but I am frightened about retuning to 'normal' as it is that mentality of normal imbalanced power that allowed for people to be vulnerable.

I am however amazed by the resilience and adaptability of people to accept this new life style of not going out side.
