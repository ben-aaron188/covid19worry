I feel anxious all the time and worried for my family and friends. I feel lonely as I live on my own and only go out for a daily walk with my dog. I go to the shops to shop for my elderly Mum and then take it to her, leaving it on her doorstep. I hate just talking to her through the door and I feel sad leaving her like that. I am anxious going to the shops and would rather not go but my Mum relies on me. I feel sad watching the news and hearing the figures for the number of deaths that day. I feel confused and disillusioned by what we are told to do by the government and what they seem to be doing. Iâ€™m worried we are not being told the truth by the government.
