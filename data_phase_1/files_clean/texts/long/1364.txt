Scared and frustrated by people not following guidelines. Anxious about what will happen if I or my partner get the virus. Sad that we are in this situation and that we are so unprepared. Missing my family and friends. Lonely despite being with my partner 24/7. Relieved that moving in together happened when it did and has worked so well, guilty that he has had so many financial difficulties caused by this. Happy that despite everything we get to be together and that, while this is a horrendous situation it has come now and not a year ago when we wouldn't have been ready for living together. Guilty that there is anything in here that I am happy about.
