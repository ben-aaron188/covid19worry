It is a very worrying time and wish that this does not last for much longer. I am very thankful to all frontline workers. It is important to adhere to the guideleins which have been set in order for this situation to be resolved as soon as possible. It is worrying for anyone because anyone can get the virus and the safest way to protect oneself is to stay at home. With a group effort we can make sure that we get past this situation as soon as possible and make sure that everyone who has been affected can recover from the situation.
