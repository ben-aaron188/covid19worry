I feel stressed. I was visiting my Mum to look after her and had been away from home for five weeks and due to go back but then came lockdown so I'm stuck here. My Mum is one of the countries most vulnerable and has received a letter saying so, so I'm worried about her. My partner back in London who I haven't seen in ages currently has Coronavirus and is very ill and I'm incredibly concerned about him but can't do anything.

I'm also asthmatic so worried about myself if I get it and the whole situation is just stressful and draining.
