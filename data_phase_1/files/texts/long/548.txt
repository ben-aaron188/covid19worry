People are out of work and it's making our country's economy crash, so that's very frustrating. I know the death rate is much lower than most people realise, due to unreported cases. Overall it is a really frustrating situation. It is upsetting that people are losing their loved ones, and I was feeling extremely anxious when my significant other had the symptoms, but my anxiety went away after she got better. Overall I don't see this as a depressing or sad time, in general. Around 4% of all motorcycle accidents result in death, but people seem to be riding motorcycles without any worries; I try to see it like that. Although obviously the comparison could be better, as there are multiple positives to riding a motorcycle, people choose to ride them, and etc, but I hope people still realise that the risks are the same, and the risk of riding a motorcycle is really not that high.
