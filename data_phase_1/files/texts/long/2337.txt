I feel very worried and scared that it might take a long time for life to get back to normal. I'm wanting to try out new experiences such as food but I am unable to do so because nowhere is open. I've enjoyed my time at home but it's getting boring very quickly and it's the same old thing every day. It's been super stressful as the supermarkets here have massive ques outside of them so just to get basic necessities is a  big pain. The number of cases is only rising which is super scary to me, there are a number of people in my area who have the virus which again gives me more anxiety
