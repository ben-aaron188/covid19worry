Just seen on the news that Boris Johnson has been moved to intensive care due to the coronavirus. It’s very scary to see the amount of people being infected including our pm.
It’s also scary going to shops, everyone has face masks and security are stopping people going inside.
Some of my friends and family also have the virus and right now it doesn’t look good for anyone as the amount of deaths are rapidly increasing.

I have nothing else to say but I need to get over 500 words.
