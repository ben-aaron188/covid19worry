nothing has really changed for me, I work in asda so am still going to work. it's just the social distancing that I have to comply with. People are still coming into browse and buy non essential items so I don't think they are complying with the government rules. I feel sorry for the older people who have to self isolate, and all the children stuck at home but unfortunately people are still gathering so the longer they do this the longer this will continue. …………………………………………………………...………………...……………………...……………………………...…………...………...
