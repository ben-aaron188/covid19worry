I feel worried and uncertain. There is no precise end date and no yet found vaccine. Jobs and businesses all around the world are uncertain and this shows the severity of everything. I feel like the economy will be an awful mess after all of this and that makes me worried. Prices will be sure to rise and Iâ€™m not currently sure if our NHS will cope with this virus. I also needed a routine dental check up, and a GP appointment for a routine check up on medication, but I feel like even those things are too much to ask for at the moment.
