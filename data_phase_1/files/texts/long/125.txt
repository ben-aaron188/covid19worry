I feel anxious because it is so unknown and I do not have much trust in the government after their cuts to the NHS. I worry about my family since some of them are high risk, but I am not too worried for myself because I am healthy and young. I miss my partner who is in another country and whom I may not see for many months. However, I am not concerned for the fallout post-coronavirus because that is out of my control and I will just be happy to be reunited with my friends and girlfriend. And a small part of me is fascinated by witnessing a crucial historic moment unfold before my eyes.
