Well, I feel anxious. I have kids and I'm worried about them and my husband. It's hard times for all of us and I'm trying to keep myself calm because of them but I can't help being worried about the coronavirus. I really hope that everything will be ok and we will be back to normal soon. Still, I am sad about all the people who lost someone they love. It's hard for the kids as well. My biggest one knows everything about the coronavirus but my little one doesn't understand why she cannot go to school and why she cannot spend time with her grandparents and her friend. We are all in this situation and I pray that it's going to be over soon.
