I am very concerned and extremely anxious about the current coronovirus situation, particularly as a close member of my family is stuck in New Zealand with no apparent help from the government to get home.  The recent images of people with the virus who are in comas and on ventilators, lying on their stomachs in rows with no privacy or dignity has stuck in my head and is making me feel very frightened.  I am just trying to keep my family safe and I am also quite angry at and upset at the people who are not taking notice of staying home.
