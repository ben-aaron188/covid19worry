I am enjoying the down time and doing things at a slower pace, I feel relaxed. I feel hopeful about my future as I have done some contemplation about the future. I feel a little annoyed that people are not following the lock down. I feel happy that I am relaxed and have more time to myself. I feel less stressed too, which is a great thing and I am keen to keep this feeling of relaxation. I am grateful that I still have my job and can earn a living. I am not really missing friends. I am suprised that I am enjoying the lockdown.
