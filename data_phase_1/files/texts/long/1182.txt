Covid 19 scares me for what the future may bring not only for myself and my family but the whole world. I donâ€™t think the world will ever be the same again. It will have a massive impact on society. Core staff will become exhausted and drained, putting strain on their job. The people ignoring the rules are annoying me, they are not doing their part in this, making the situation worse and causing a greater impact once again.
It in a grim light may help with population control but the economy is going to plummet putting everyone in financial strain
