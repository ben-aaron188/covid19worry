I am very worried about me and my family getting coronavirus and getting seriously ill and dying. I am also worried about my partner losing his job and struggling financially.. I am finding is stressful having my daughter off school and not knowing when she will be going back. I also have a newborn which I think makes the situation more stressful and I think is affecting my mental health as I have lost my support network. Not knowing when the lockdown and restrictions are going to end is hard to deal with and knowing it will probably be for a while.
