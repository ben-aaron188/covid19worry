I am currently sat at home listening to the daily Government briefing being broadcast by the BBC and am appalled by the incompetence of the incumbent government - it has consistently worried me how vague their messaging was until lockdown was introduced and even then they continued to be vague. Testing is, as seen in other countries with lower mortality rates, the key to controlling the situation. We are well behind other nations like Germany and South Korea and this concerns me greatly, as well as the fact that many of my loved ones and those of my friends are vulnerable
