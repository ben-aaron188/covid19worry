I am very concerned about the health of my family and friends. Where I live is a popular tourist location and I am furious that people are ignoring travel restrictions and visiting our area. I am doing everything I can to keep my children safe and happy but I am constantly worried about the future and how long this outbreak will last. My husband is also very anxious and this has led to more friction between us than usual. I hate arguing with him and I am so angry that the response to this virus has been so slow worldwide. My children are 13, 6 and 4. The two youngest don't understand how serious the situation is. My oldest does and is very scared for her friends, some of their parents are in the high risk groups and her best friends mother is currently hospitalized with coronavirus. It is hard to reassure her that it will all be alright in the end. She misses her friends terribly and at her age feels like the restrictions will never end. I am tired, frustrated and frightened at the moment.
