I am concerned about the current COVID-19 pandemic but I’m also aware I am doing everything possible. I’m angered by people not following basic rules and the situation proving to be getting worse. I’m anxious for my friends who are in the higher risk categories and also for my job. I worry about when normal service will be resumed and how the country will recover afterwards. I am sad primarily due to the lack of human interaction although I am grateful for my house mate who makes things much happier.
