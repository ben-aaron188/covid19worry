At this moment in time i am quite anxious about the Corona situation.  My job has been furloughed and as a result money will be more of a stretch than it currently was.  I will have to ask for a mortgage holiday to cover the shortfall.  My wife has a chronic condition and does not work or receive benefits and is anxious about us catching the illness and putting either ours and/or our daughters life in danger as a result. 

The daily increase in cases both nationally and locally is concerning and as a result i am more anxious to go out and put either my own or my families health at risk.  It is a very uncertain time and whilst the daily briefings from the government are helpful and provide some information they do little to ease any concerns that my family and i have.
