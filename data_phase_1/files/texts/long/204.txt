I feel extremely worried and scared, especially as many people I know have been affected by this disease.
I am anxious due to the uncertainty of this very fragile situation and it is scary as we do not know when the number of cases in the UK and world wide will begin to decrease.
I am angry at seeing several people still disobeying the lockdown rules and it is sad to know that people can be so selfish.
I am grateful to the NHS workers and key workers who are being so brave and risking their lives to save others. 
I am becoming increasingly fearful everyday, yet I try to remain as hopeful as possible.
