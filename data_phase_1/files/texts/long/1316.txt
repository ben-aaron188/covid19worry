I feel nervous cause it's getting worse and people are not listening about the self islotation and still going out enjoying the sun, risking speading it more. I'm starting to get really bored and agitated as we arent aloud to go out. My daughter is really bored too. I hope it hurts and goes so we can get back to reality. I feel like more and more people are dying as the days go by, I've had a few people I know who have passed away alone this year which is scary. My sleeping pattern is rubbish at the minute because I'm not doing much throughout the day like normally.
