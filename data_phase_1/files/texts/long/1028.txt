I'm upset about the situation but not afraid, I am just depressed in general and am finding the situation intolerable. I am sick of people complaining and not following the rules. I have no other feelings either way about this and anything else I am writing is merely to fill the required characters to allow me to move on to the next part of the questions, which I am finding hard to Do. I do not have these many feelings and have fully explained my self and am finding I am getting annoyed because this just keeps making me write more than I care to.
