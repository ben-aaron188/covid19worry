I'm very anxious and restless at the moment. As of right now I feel very stuck in limbo, it's very hard to know what the future will be like right now and I am very worried about other family members. I don't think any of the governments around the world have handled the situation adequately and we'll all suffer even after this lockdown is over. Nobody can say what the repercussions will be so i think a lot of people must feel the same sort of fear and anxiety that I do about the Covid-19 outbreak.
