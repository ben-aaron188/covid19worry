I am worried about family members with prior health conditions catching the virus.
I am also anxious about my finances as I am on furlough and I am the main income earner.
I am constantly trying to think of ways to get through the situation financially.
I feel a lot of pressure to do the right thing and make the right choices for my families health and financial future.
All this worry is having an adverse effect on mine and my families mood.
My wife already suffers from depression and I fear the current situation will be very detrimental to her mood and our relationship as a whole.
