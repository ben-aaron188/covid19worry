Worried about catching the virus and the impact it will have and financial implications Concerned about our elderly parents, not being able to see them whilst they are self isolation. Fustrated about not being able to go out and enjoy the sunshine due to lockdown. Stressed as I am now a full time teacher home schooling my children. Guilty as I am working from home and trying to strike a balance between managing the children and trying to work. Resolute and trying to stay strong  as I am not alone and every family is experiencing the same.
