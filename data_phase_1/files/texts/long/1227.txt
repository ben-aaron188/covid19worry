I have had a good day homeworking (no homeschooling due to the Easter break, although still taking care of my children) and am getting the hang of this now. I deliberately did not watch today's briefing, although I did receive my ""Boris"" letter today. I just feel I need regular mental health breaks from the news to lessen my anxiety, and keep me productive in my roles at home, and work. I feel much better for it. 

So today I feel more relaxed, less stressed, more acclimaticised, and safe and well in my home with my children.
