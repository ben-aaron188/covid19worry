The initial worry has passed, mostly due to how long the situation has been going on for. Mild anger or disappointment toward people not following the isolation measures, but I have felt overwhelming positivity, pride and warmth due to the support and efforts of the NHS and other key workers. The anxiety of this situation is mostly toward the financial implications and unrest. The media are very good at reporting the bad things which makes for very negative news mostly, but I suppose making people scared is the best way to ensure they stick to the isolation measures.
