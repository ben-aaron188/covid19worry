I am feeling very anxious about everything right now. I don't know how my degree is going to pan out or where I am going to live. I am anxious and scared about the safety of my parents who are at risk.
I feel angry about the whole situation - I can't go home and see my friends, I can't visit my family, I cant finish my degree. I feel lost and sad and upset but there's no one that I can blame for it.
I am anxious every time I leave the house because I am scared that if I come into contact with people that I will get ill myself, or that I will pass on the virus to people that would be dangerously affected by the virus. I have been anxious and paranoid and washing my hands until they bleed. I am scared about when this all passes, as I can't remember what life was like before this and how bad the economy will be afterwards.
