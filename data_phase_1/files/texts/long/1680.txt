I feel very sad about the people that have lost their lives, especially young children and parents. I feel very sad for all of the people who are still having to work in these conditions, no matter what there job is. And I feel worried for my friend and family and a little for myself. I hope that it comes to an end very soon. I also feel angry about people who are still going out and ignoring the guidelines set out by the government, however I think that we should have gone on full lockdown because some people are just not getting the message and then this will go on for even longer. There should be tougher punishments for people who are breaking the rules.
