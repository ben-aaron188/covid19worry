After weeks of anxiety and stress concerning the coronavirus I have started to feel more at peace. I have settled into a new routine and have kind of got used to the new normal. I have stopped worrying about what I cant control and focused on what I can eg. staying at home. I am looking forward to the day when life can become normal again and taking time to reassess life and my goals for the future when the pandemic is over. I am doing what I can to help myself and others to make it out of this situation healthy and well.
