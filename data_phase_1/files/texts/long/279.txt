Frustrated that certain members of the public are not taking the threat seriously. 
Generally the issues with getting essential food from the supermarkets is a little bit time consuming but safety matters to everyone and social distancing is there to help prevent the spread of the viral infection is a necessity.
Working from home if available does offer additional security when it comes to self isolation. 
However some companies appear to be chasing their revenue streams rather than thinking of their staffs welfare. It appears as if staff are expected to be very flexible with their work schedules to avoid companies cease trading (Taking annual leave forced shutdowns). However whenever we get back to some form of normality I expect companies won't remember what their staff did for them.
