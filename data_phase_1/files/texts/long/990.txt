I feel very anxious, I am the daughter of a key worker (radiotherapist). Although my parent is not high risk or frontline he still treats suspected COVID patients which is anxiety inducing.
Everything is very uncertain which adds to anxiety and fear.

I am also a physician associate student. My placement has been cancelled and my future uncertain. There is talk of us being paid and working as if we are qualified to help on the front line which, to be honest, scares me. From what I have seen, PPE is not up to CDC or WHO standard.
