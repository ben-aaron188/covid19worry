I feel stressed about the additional work it's resulted in as a key worker but am working from home and not going out unless absolutely necessary which has stopped me worrying as much.

I remain hopeful that the pandemic will be over if everyone abides by the rules and I feel like I'm not missing out on anything as most places are closed.

I am concerned about how some individuals are disregarding the health and safety of others although I believe they are finally starting to understand the impact. I think we, as a nation, are doing what we can and I am absolutely positive that we will get through it.
