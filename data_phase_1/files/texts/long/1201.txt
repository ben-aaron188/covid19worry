I feel sad, parents have five it hard due to being furloughed, my business which I just started a month ago has collapsed, it's a hard time for us. I spent a long time trying to make the business work, even getting a mayor to come and open the store, for it to be shut, the first week was great sales until people started realising about COVID, then the streets become pretty empty and sales went down, now it's been a month and I have people's work in the shop that may be damaged. Which I'm responsible for. It's unfortunate and annoying, especially since the economy might not heal for a while. I'll have to change my plans. My parents are using their savings and yes, they have enough but it's hard.
