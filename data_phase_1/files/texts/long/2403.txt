I am sad that so many people around the world are losing their lives. I hope if countries pull together and do their collective bit we can fight this disease.
Hopefully China will lead the way so all countries can get back to normal. This has been good for climate change so maybe people will rethink how they go about their daily lives.
Hopefully with the current social distancing measures this will help slow down the disease and help eradicate it. I work for the nhs so am on the frontline and we are all trying to do our part to help the patients get better.
