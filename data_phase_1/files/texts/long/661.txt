I feel pretty fed up and resigned to staying in for weeks. I'm very sad for my children who can't see their friends and extended relatives.
I feel like the neighborhood has become very judgemental and is encouraged to spy on each other to tell if someone is breaking the lock-down rules. 
I'm appreciating how much freedom we had before this lockdown but everyone just took it for granted. Now people are getting outside and enjoying exercising. Suddenly things seem so much more appealing when you know you're not supposed to be doing them.
