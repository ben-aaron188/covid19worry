I’m just anxious because there is a lot of uncertainty with regards to how lethal this will be and how long we will be under lockdown. I just hope it won’t get too severe and wonder how life will be after this. I’m worried that some of my family members will get sick. I’m also worried that some small businesses will shut down because of the financial implications of this. Life is probably not going to be the same any longer after all of this has finished. How long is it going to go on for? Also, how many lives will ultimately be lost? Will the NHS reach capacity? I hope not.
