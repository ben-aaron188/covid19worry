The corona virus situation is a serious matter that has poses a threat to many people's lives, knowing this makes me anxious. This anxious feeling expands into the unknown regarding the situation, we do not know for how long this situation will be going on for. I am annoyed with those who do not follow the government's lockdown and social distancing rules and those who are panic buying for no reason, whilst the rest of us sit at home bored with limited social interactions. Despite all this, I am currently relived to be healthy and not be suffering from said virus due to government intervention.
