I feel anxious for what is to come, scared that people I know may be seriously ill or die. I am annoyed that some people aren't taking it seriously. I feel scared to go to the supermarket. I am worried about the impact it will have on my job currently and on its future. I am sad that I cannot visit any of my friends and family at the moment. I wish I had an outdoor terrace or garden and a dog where I live. I am unsure how long this will all last for. I miss the simple things in life. On the other hand, I am enjoying being less busy and taking time to relax and do the things I always put off because I don't make time to do them.
