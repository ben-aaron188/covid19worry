I am mad and upset that people aren't taking lockdown seriously. I feel sorry for NHS workers who are under immense pressure and lose their staff to COVID-19. I would love the world to go back to normal but that's not going to happen unless we stick to what has been advised. People are so selfish. There are people down my street who go out frequently and at the weekend invited family who don't live here for a Barbecue. They are just making it worse. I'm worried for my parents and for the Prime Minister. I'm sad I can't see my boyfriend but at least my family is keeping safe.
