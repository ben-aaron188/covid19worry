I continue to be surprised at just how wide ranging and severe the impacts of the virus have been, and spend lots of time wondering how it might develop in the future, what changes it may or may not bring about. Mostly I lament that it has interrupted my studies and some of my hobbies. I am not too concerned about the situation itself, but am slightly worried for more vulnerable family members. I have some frustration towards the Chinese practice of operating wildlife markets and the role that has played in the origin of the virus
