I am feeling very anxious at the moment as I am so unsure about where and when this will all come to a head and questioning if life as we knew it before will be back.
I am also annoyed at people not following the rules and being so selfish by breaking the lockdown rules.
I am worried about being judged when I need to go out and get essentials also as I live alone and have nobody who can get essentials for me.
Anxiety and worry are definitely the emotions I am currently strongest feeling. Worry for myself and for my family and loved ones.
I am sad also because I miss the loved ones in my life.
