Whilst I feel that there is little risk to me, I feel anxious about the health of the greater population, as some people don’t seem to be taking the rules for lockdown seriously. I’m unable to work from home so this period is a chance for me to catch up on DIY, this may also be why I don’t feel as much pressure as other may feel. 
I think the government was too late in bringing in the necessary measures and so there will be more deaths than if they had been stricter, faster. 
The general population seems to be taking this opportunity as a holiday, not realising that every unnecessary trip could result in them passing the virus to multiple other people, as they may have the virus but be asymptomatic
