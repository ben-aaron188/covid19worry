worried about elderly and vulnerable family members. 
sad that I'm unable to visit my grandmother.
worried for the people who have to work, including me.
gutted that university graduation and my holidays will be canceled.
grateful that no one in my family has become sick.
positive that the earth has a break from humanity.
realised what is important in life and what is not.
angry at people who are not following the rules.
gutted that the football season, which was to be one of the best in history for my club, has been negatively impacted.
sad that life and plans have to be put off but will do whatever to follow the rules and get this done as quickly as possible.
bored of being in the house and not being able to go out.
optimistic that this will be over soon.
wishing that the government would've acted quicker and hoping they show up and deal with this appropriately.
