It’s annoying that some people like myself are going into their fourth week of lockdown whereas others who haven’t taken it seriously are going onto the second week. It’s sad to see that there’s still many people not taking government advise. The uncertainty of when this will all end is awful as well when can normal life begin again. The uncertainty of unknowing when I will be able to pay for bills and direct debits without rationing my last of my wages. It’s hard to keep yourself occupied during this time as well when you’re in an unhappy household, avoiding family members and really being stuck to your bedroom.
