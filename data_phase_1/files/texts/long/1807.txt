The most impact on my situation is economy which is going down. I fear for the future when i have no work and i would't be able to find new one. Also i have anxiety because i don't know what's going to happen to my mother, she's in risk group. I can call her and ask about situation but in no way i can help her. I don't know if i had corona virus with no symptom or will i have one. Whole situation right now is making slowly my brain go nuts because of lock down. I understand reason but there is no sport, cinema, pubs. I feel boredom. And i'm gaining weight and i really have not enough exercises.
