I am just so worried. I am worried about my family that lives thousands of miles away, I am worried about my mother who lives on her own and still has to go to work. I am worried about my brother who was looking for work just before the crisis began. And I am worried when this will end - will we ever return to normal? Will we go on holiday again? We were so excited to celebrate my graduation this summer and now this won't happen. And any good news, personal and professional, is so rapidly forgotten because you can't celebrate it with anyone.
