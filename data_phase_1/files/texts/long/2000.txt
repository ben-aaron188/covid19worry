I feel worried for my parents and loved ones at this time. I would like to see and help them but have to keep away and so feel helpless. I feel sad and trapped in isolation but I want to keep everyone safe. I want things to go back to normal as I find it hard to find joy or be motivated out of my normal routine. I feel anxious about the future and how it is going to look and anxious for our nhs and the people who still have to go to work. I feel scared when outside because the virus is invisible and I donâ€™t fully understand how it spreds and I hate having to be so wary and nervous of other people. I mostly feel worried and great sadness about how quickly the world has changed and all that we will lose.
