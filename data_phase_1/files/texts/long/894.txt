I am very anxious about my future financial situation and commitments, if I am made to be on furlough too long. I am also concerned by the level of power the government is able to wield during the country's lockdown and fear it may develop into a police state. I am also missing my friends and colleagues during this time and my freedom to go and do what I want. I am also fearful that China will recover while the rest of the world is still going through the worst of it, which can leave us in an incredibly vulnerable position that China may wish to take advantage of.
