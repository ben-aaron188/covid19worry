My feelings are essentially of anxiety and fear for my family - both young and old. I am also extremely proud of how the country has pulled together though, including the NHS and other key workers. I am not sure how I will feel as the situation continues and the lockdown lengthens. While it was a novelty at first - this has long since passed and my stress levels are increasing. However, I try to be optimistic - I am in a good position compared to others and we must all try and continue as best we can.
