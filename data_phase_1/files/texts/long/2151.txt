Currently I do not mind the situation in terms of the lockdown as I am able to save money and also focus on my degree studies. I worry for the population especially young people who may catch the virus and pass this onto vulnerable family members. I am anxious about finding a job after graduating this year due to potential recession. I also worry for my own health as I do have asthma. I do wish for life to return to normal soon so I am able to enjoy the summer and everyone can be happy. I am disgusted at the way some people are not taking government advice seriously and believe these individuals are selfish and not considering how their actions impact the whole population especially NHS workers
