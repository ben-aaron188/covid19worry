Sacred for the whole country, but really scared for my elderly parents. Scared of the financial implications for myself and my husband. Worry that the value of our house will deteriorate and we will be in a much poorer situation as a result. Think that the country will go into a recession. Am now worried that the priminister is now in intensive care. Miss seeing my friends and loosing contact with them. Live in fear of picking something up and transferring it to my parents and worry about them dying
