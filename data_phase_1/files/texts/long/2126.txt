I have been seeing and reading of so many tragic and sad real life situations that many people have found themselves in due to the coronavirus and the situation surrounding it. It has made me feel very sad for those people and it will happen to more in the future. This gives me a feeling of anxiety about the future. There are many indirect consequences of this virus and the I think one of the worst of those is the loneliness and isolation of many people especially the elderly, at this time. It breaks my my heart to think of so many people in that situation .. I am not very worried about my own situation infact I feel very lucky compared to so many others.
