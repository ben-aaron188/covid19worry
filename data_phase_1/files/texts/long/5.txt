I am very worried that I might contract Coronavirus I have to care for my elderly father and I worry I might pass it into him Iâ€™m also worried about job security and paying my bills I am also very scared when I go and do the basic things like shopping for groceries and I will put this off until the last minute. I am also very angry that some people are just ignoring the social distancing and not following the rules that the government have laid out. I am also concerned that our leader Boris Johnson has been admitted into hospital with Coronavirus symptoms and I hope for a speedy recovery as he was doing such a great job and I worry that his replacement will do such a good job the nation needs him
