I feel scared, worried and anxious about the whole situation. Just heard that Boris Johnson is now intensive care and this just adds to my anxiety, poor man letâ€™s hope he recovers quickly. I feel worried about the future, about the health of myself and my family and about how things will progress.  I worry for the future and what will happen next. I worry about the economy and the effect this current situation will have on both the economy of this country and of the world.  I feel anxious every day about catching the virus, what that would mean and how I would react to it.
