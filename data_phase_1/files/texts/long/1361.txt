Uncertain about how long the Lockdown will last, would like to know more about time so I can prepare. The length of uncertainty isn't helping work as the moment I'm planning as if things get back to normal in few weeks but might not be and it's frustrating to make plans that might not happen and it be wasted effort. I'm on annual leave this week which is a good break but giving me more time to think. This morning was particularly hard as I felt quite stressed but had a bath. I'm frustrated about the suggestions to stop exercise as going for walks / runs are important for my mental and physical well-being and I'll miss them if I can't
