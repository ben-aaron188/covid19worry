I am worried about the future financial ramifications of the current crisis. 
I am concerned that i will pass this onto people that will not survive. I also worry that a family member will become ill and i will not be able to see them. i am feeling unsure as there is no timescale for this crisis.
I am furloughed from work and using this time to focus on myself and that is positive.
i am enjoying the time i get to spend with my partner. I also think this is a good time to unwind and get into art, which i have neglected for a long time.
