I am very worried as it has affected many things; not only has it caused death and pain to other families but I fear what could happen to my family. It is also not a time where I can relax unlike other people because I have studies which have actually increased because my college thinks because you're home, you should do even more work as you have even more free time. But that is not the case as I have difficulty studying at home as I get easily distracted, that is why I used to work in the library instead as I can be more productive in that environment. I have been lacking a lot in the studies and I am very worried, unlike GCSES and A levels which have been post-poned, college course work is still here to complete.
