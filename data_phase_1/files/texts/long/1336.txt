I am a aware that it may still get worse so I'm very careful especially at work as I'm working for big company. I'm keeping social distancing as that's the only way to keep you a bit safer.
From this week I'm going to use gloves and possibly a mask as there are a lot of new starters so I do not know where they coming from and I have a little baby so I'm a bit scared but I must stay positive.

I'm also trying to do a shopping once a week as there are a lot of people daily and there is not point to go everyday.
