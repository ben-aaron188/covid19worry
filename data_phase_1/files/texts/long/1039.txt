Concerned for family and friends and worried re potential work and financial implications. Saddened for people across the globe, particularly in places such as the Mumbai slums where social distancing is impossible and death rates could be absolutely catastrophic. The UK lockdown is not impacting too much on my emotions and enjoying the time with my wife. I think working from home gives me some necessary structure to my days and fear for a time I may be furloughed and lose that. Social media platforms have eased the difficulty of being apart from family and friends.
