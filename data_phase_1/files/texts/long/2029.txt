I feel not enough is being done from a government point of view as so many people co to us to “break” the rules and put other people at risk. 

I fear for our NHS and the fallout that is yet to happen. I worry more young adults like myself will die. People don’t seem to understand how serious this is and what could happen.

Our economy is also suffering greatly and I worry about all the poor people who have been paid off or are self employed. I know money can’t just magically appear but I feel the government could do more to support these people.
