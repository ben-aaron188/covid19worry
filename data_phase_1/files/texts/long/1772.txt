I am getting a bit more worried about the situation as a family member has been suspected to have corona and is being released from the hospital after receiving treatment. However, I think it is more the unknown that is scary as he wasn't tested so this goes to show even if the health care system thinks you might have the virus, they still don't have the resources to clarify this. I am worried that the NHS isn't going to be able to cope with the situation even though many amazing people are risking their lives to do all they can to care for others.
