I think the news ect, has escalated it more than needs to be, causing fear for a lot of people. I have Anxiety and depression, I have a fear of leaving the house, and have only left the house already a handful of times since last year, with all this going on now I'm unable to even leave my bedroom because of everyone's actions around me, seeing how anxious and stressed, they are. 

I'm a carer for my mum, she cant get up to even make food to get her tablets with, because we couldnt get a food delivery, I had to force myself get her some food from the corner shop, less than 2 minutes away, but because I was anxious with everyone around me, I ended up having an anxiety attack, everyone around me thought it was corona virus, since they're all clueless listening to what everyone else says, and it ended up making me worse. for 2 days I was in agony only sending myself worse cause of the whole situation, I can still hear there reactions towards me.

Im also now unable to get my medication, from my doctors, or have my follow up appointments, at the doctors, and meetings to help with my anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.
