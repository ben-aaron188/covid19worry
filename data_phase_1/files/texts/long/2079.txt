I feel so anxious, for my family, friends and my self. I feel sick to the stomach of what we could potentially go through. I feel sad that people are currently living through this. I can't believe that this is happening. Every time i think about it i feel like i am going to die. I am getting scared of going outside and i'm not sure how we're going to get through this and back to a world we knew before. Everytime i hear of somebody else dying i get petrified that someone i am close to will be next. At first i was dealing with it okay, however as time goes on i am truly struggling
