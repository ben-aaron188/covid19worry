Despise being compared to a ‘war-time’ situation, my fear is stemmed mostly by the fact it is an invisible enemy. I am scared that an action, or lack of, can risk hundreds of people’s lives. I am scared for my grandparents, and even more scared that if they become unwell I won’t be able to see them. I appreciate the uncertainty of the situation however the unknown is causing the most anxiety, not knowing how long these restrictions can continue. The memory of normality is the only thing striving me to keep going. I feel angry at those few who think they are above everyone else and are disobeying the rules. I’m am concerned that my future has been put on hold and I don’t know when it will continue
