I am extremely worried for the future prospects in my personal finances and in my employment situation. I'm asking myself lots of questions: Will I still have a job in future? can i enhance my career? I'm very worried about my personal health as well as the health of my partner who works in the care industry and has a heart murmur. My parents are also a point of concern with them being elderly and vulnerable to health issues. Also, the enforced isolation is having a negative impact on my mental health with a feeling of imprisonment. The constant media coverage is exhausting.
