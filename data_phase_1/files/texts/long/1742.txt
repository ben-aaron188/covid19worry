I'm quite relaxed about the situation - we're fortunate enough to have a roof over our heads, are able to work remotely, have sufficient food, and contact with family and friends.  If we all follow the lockdown guidelines and maintain social distancing, we should be able to see the end of this crisis in due course.  There is little point worrying about it, as it's completely out of my control.  I also feel that I have to lead by example to my elderly parents, and my team at work - by being fairly laid back about it while staying at home.
