I feel anxious when my husband gets back from the shops- worried about germs from the shops and trying to clean them. Otherwise I feel a bit detached and numb about it - I live in a village so it’s very quiet, so it almost feels like it isn’t going on at times.  I feel very sad that I can’t see my family at the moment. My dad recently died (not of covid) and I can’t see my mum to comfort her. I feel worried about disrupting the routines of my little girl who is 2. She normally lives going to nursery. However,  despite all this I am having some nice quality time with my children and husband and enjoying preparing nice meals. My husband isn’t getting lots of good jobs around the house done which does feel satisfying and motivating despite other things going on.
