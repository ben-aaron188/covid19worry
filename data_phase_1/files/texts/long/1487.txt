Living in a rural village and my mothers businesses having to stop due to the virus, we aren't in contact with that many people so my fear of catching the virus is low. However, my elderly grandmother lives alone in the same village and I am worried about her getting it. She isn't in contact with many people but I still worry that she will get it and she has a cat that I fear wonders and may pick it up from other people. I also worry for my mother because she is 57 and had pleurisy 2 years ago which almost developed into pneumonia.
