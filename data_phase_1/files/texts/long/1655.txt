I have been furloughed from work, which gives me reassurance that I will have a company to return to when this is over. I am enjoying being at home, catching up on jobs and relaxing, but equally frustrated that holidays and plans have been cancelled for the foreseeable. I am accepting of the situation however and wouldn't say I am angry at anyone. The uncertainty of how long this may go on for gives me some anxiety, but I hope come the late summer/autumn some restrictions will have been lifted. I miss my family, who live over 3 hours away, but grateful for my partner and where I live - there's lots of footpaths and open green spaces around us. Exercise helps pass the time and raises spirits.
