I'm worried that I may get it badly and wor't be able to breath. I also worry about my family. We are living in uncertain times. I don't feel at ease and often feel anxious. I also miss going out to visit family and friends. Things just feel strange. I'm also worried about money and bored. Wondering when it will all end. It dosen't feel real. It feels like a dream or a movie. The street seem very quiet. I have started to hear the birds singing more though, in the morning when I wake up I notice it.
