My teenage son, who is autistic, doesn't understand that he cannot go shopping with his Mum but sees other people doing similar. Whilst out on a run, I've just caught my teenage daughter walking along with her boyfriend and doesn't see anything wrong. At this time I feel it will be stupidity and complacency that kills me. It doesn't matter what I say or do, I appear to be in the wrong. I cannot believe that despite all the coverage that they are still not convinced that it applies to them. I have no idea what it is going to take to convince them how serious this is.
