I feel anxious about both the global situation and my personal situation. I feel restless and unable to relax. I feel unproductive and worried about the future, which is uncertain. I feel angry at people not listening to government guidelines. I feel worried for them and for those they affect. I am grateful to researchers for the work they are doing. I am grateful to essential workers but I am worried for them and their health & safety. I am proud of communities pulling together to help those who are vulnerable.
