I feel stressed, anxious and sad all at the same time about the situation in the world at the moment. I am a highly anxious person anyway amd this has greatly exacerbated it. 
Anger is another feeling that surges up. The fact that this is happening and a lot of people are not taking it seriously and still going out is beyond me. I am very confused as to what needs to happen to make some people understand the gravity of the sitation. Many people are dying and a lot more will unless people do what they are told.
