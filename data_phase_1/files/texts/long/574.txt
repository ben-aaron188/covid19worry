I am quite scared and anxious because the situation is uncertain and I don't know what will happen in the near future. I also feel a little guilty for relaxing in isolation when front line workers are under such stress. I am hopeful at the moment that the country will be able to band together and get through isolation relatively safely. Mostly I feel very anxious as the situation has escalated so quickly and I dont know when it will end, how it will end, or when I will get my job and my school back.
