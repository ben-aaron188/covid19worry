I think the Corona virus must be intricately related to how we have destroyed our global environment. I feel conflicted about it, because in many ways the current economic shutdown, especially the downing of planes, should have been the response, or similar, to declaring a climate emergency. We are still hurtling towards runaway global warming, and that is a collective insanity by any reasonable definition. The reduction in air pollution is also double edged. There is a phenomena called Global Dimming (which is in the IPCC report), where the pollution layer is blocking about 1 degree of extra warming about that pollution layer that has already occurred. The reduction of that pollution layer removes that reduction, and will potentially push us to the edge of runaway global warming. Global Dimming should be discussed. All of these crises are interrelated.
