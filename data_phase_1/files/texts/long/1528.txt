I think that the lockdown in the UK will lead to an economic situation involving deaths. If the economic situation is sufficiently bad over time,  it could lead to more deaths than the coronavirus. Professor Philip Thomas' modelling from Bristol University says a 6.4% drop in GDP will lead to more deaths than beating the virus. I feel hopeful less deaths will result, if the correct balance is taken. But I also feel a bit worried the government will extend the lockdown. I feel optimistic that most people will recover and the number of deaths will fall.
