At the moment I am feeling frustrated regarding the current situation and people’s responses to it. I am also a little worried as a couple of people around me are at a higher risk. I am also stressed about my ability to get a job in the summertime due to the severity of the outbreak. I am annoyed at the amount of people who are refusing to stay at home and stem the spread as I think it’s selfish and counterproductive. I am also stressed about my future career goals as they might have been influenced by the corona outbreak, which has affected the economy and ruined a lot of smaller businesses.
