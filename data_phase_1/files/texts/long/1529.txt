I am both frustrated and anxious about how some people are ignoring the lockdown rules. I want to have hope but just cant see it at the moment and instead have an overwhelming feeling of despair. If attitudes don't change soon they may either go on until next year or never get any better.
As a key worker myself (as well as my wufe) I am constantly anxious about infection and bringing it home to my children. It is a horrible situation to be in when you are constantly scared to do your job or be suspicious of your coworkers and be worried about working with them
