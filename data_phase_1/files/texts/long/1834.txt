I feel sad for all the people infected and those that died and their families. Somewhat pissed off at how the government have handled the outbreak airports and eurotunnel still open...Particulary concerned at Boris Johnson with the situation of him still continuing to shake hands even with coronavirus patients...no wonder he is in hospital at the moment showas a disregard for the situation, fear the worse is yet to come. Me personally I am not worried health wise more concerned for my eldely parents and of course the effect it will have on our everyday lives moving forward
