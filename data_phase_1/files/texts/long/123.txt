Very anxious, I am sceptical about the origins of the virus. Everything is very surreal and this is the first time, as it is for many, I've experienced this collective behaiviour across the world. Odd times. I feel the nation's response is inadequate which makes me angry.

I would say a positive is having a more introverted lifestyle, which I am known to enjoy. There is less commotion and urgency about my life personally so I am more relaxed but it means the mind has more time to think.

Overall these circumstances make me think and ponder a lot more, probably as I have more time. It has both negative and positive impacts.
