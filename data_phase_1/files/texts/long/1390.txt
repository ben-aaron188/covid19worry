I feel very anxious that myself or my family and friends will contract coronavirus. I feel especially anxious for my mother, as she is a key worker. I feel sad that I can't see people I care about and that I don't know when I will be able to again. I am finding the uncertainty surrounding the whole situation very hard to deal with and am feeling a lot of anxiety because of this. I also do feel some level anger/frustration toward the UK government for not putting stricter rules into place sooner.
