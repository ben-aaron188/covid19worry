I am finding the situation daunting, as its just the unknown of it all. I am unable to see my family when I have a 9m old baby. 
I am meant to be returning to work and have already been furloughed and no idea when I will be returning properly. 
Constant update from BBC News app, is depressing me as the death toll does not seem to be dropping any time soon. 
Money was already tight before this and now its only going to get worse. 
My partner is still being sent to work eventhough he is not a key worker! But his company will not pay him otherwise.
