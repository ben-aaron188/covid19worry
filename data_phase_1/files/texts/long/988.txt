As a young person my main concern rests with with the effect the virus is having on the older population, although am still taking every precaution to ensure I do not contract Corona virus. It is unfortunate timing for our country as we have just had the problem of brexit. Mostly my emotions are of boredom as there are very few of my daily activities I am able to complete. As I am taking precautions I am not too concerned with the virus itself more the disruption it has caused to my daily life. I am also not looking forward to the many months this period of social distancing will last as it coincides with birthdays, holidays and festivals that filled up the summer holidays. Although i understand that this period must be fulfilled in order to prevent the virus lasting any longer.
