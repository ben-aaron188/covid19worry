Anxious because it's uncontrollable and I like to be in control. It is so unpredictable and I want to know when it will end. Finding it very hard cooped up all the time and want to get out and be independent. Finding it hard to keep the children occupied. Making rash decisions because it all feels a bit appocalyptic.i just want it all to be over and to go back to normality. I'm more snappy and grumpy than I usually am because I can't get out. However an using the opportunity to exercise more which has improved my mental health. I am not sleeping well though.
