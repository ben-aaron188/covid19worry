I am worried about how I will get money and provide for my child and myself. I am worried that I can't pay my rent and utilities at this moment. I am worried about my child missing out on his leavers do from primary school and not being able to say goodbye to his friends before going to high school. I am sad he has no other children to interact with. I am worried about my elderly grandmother and her health. I am stressed about the idea of going outside to do shopping and upset that I can't have them delivered. I am frightened that if I go out, I am putting my child at risk. I am worried that lack of light and exercise might create a worse problem down the line. I am concerned about the long term implications. That things will change forever.
