I feel nervous as I don't know when the lock down will end, missing my friends and loved ones, but also feel angry that people aren't all treating it in the same way or as seriously. I am looking forward to not feeling trapped in my house. I feel upset that I am far away from some family members and nervous for family which live overseas, because I now definitely don't know when I can next see them. I am really missing being in university which makes me sad that I'm missing out on the final few weeks of spending the summer with all my friends. I am grateful and thankful for all the staff trying to keep us safe.
