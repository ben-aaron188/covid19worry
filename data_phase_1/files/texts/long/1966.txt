It now seems to be very real. At the start I thought it would come to nothing ! I am just in a state of shock. It is almost as though I am living in a film. I'm not scared for myself healthwise but the country as a whole. This will have a massive impact on our lives for the foreseeable future. I am deeply concerned about the economy and how it will recover. I cant see how they can lift any of the restrictions without a serious amount of people becoming infected. This will undoubtedly be one of the biggest incidents that has happened in this country in the last 100 years. My main concern is I may lose someone close to me. At the minute there is no one in my family with any worrying symptoms.
