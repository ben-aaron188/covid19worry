I am feeling worried and anxious about the situation, if we do get it I fear that we might develop mild symptoms at the beginning and afterwards develop serious illness . I also worry about our parents and worry when we go to do our essential shopping that we will infect others or get infected.I feel like this is having a bad impact in our mental well being, looking at the news isn't good and we can't go outside for fresh air. Even though we are allowed once a day, feel like it is too dangerous to go out at the moment.
