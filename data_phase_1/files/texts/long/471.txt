Right now, I am constantly thinking that I have this disease. Living with health anxiety makes things very raw and drives me up the wall. On the other end of the scale I am happy, and relaxed because I am doing things in the house, that I had been missing, or never had time to do. I have a lot of mental problems and also an eating disorder that I feel could be triggered off with all this. At this moment I am feeling optimistic and ready for the surge ahead, but I am very scared. I think the unknown is a really lonely and sad place and I think that everyone is in the same boat, which does fill me with a sense of power and that we are all going to beat this together. Community was gone and now it is coming back which was missing in our busy lives. A good thing to come from this is that the world can breathe for a moment while we are all stopped in time.
