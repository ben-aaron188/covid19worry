As each day passes there seems to be more reason to be concerned which makes me worried, missing socializing either at the pub, or with friends on my usual Saturday board games, which is making life a bit lonely at the moment as I live alone. But the telephone and the internet are a great help. I am looking forward to the day I will be able to go out and meet my friends again in person. I am annoyed that some people are not taking notice of the guidelines the government have made, making it difficult for everyone
