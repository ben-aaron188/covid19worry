I am glad many people in the UK are volunteering to help those that are at higher risk of catching the virus. I also feel angry that a small number of people are not following the government's advice to stay at home, even on a sunny day.... Having said that, I know that most people in the UK are following the guidance, i.e., staying at home, going out only for essential shopping and only one type of exercise per day. I truly believe that this coronavirus outbreak can only go away if the WHOLE country follow the rules.
