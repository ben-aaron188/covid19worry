The Corona situation itself doesn't bother me too much as there are only a few cases in my area but since the UK has gone into lockdown I have become anxious about how it is going to affect my mental health and the mental health of other people in the country. I'm also scared that people living through domestic abuse are trapped with their abuser with no way of escaping. I'm worried that the government has failed to get the message across to the British public about how serious the situation is and how essential it is to practice social distancing.
