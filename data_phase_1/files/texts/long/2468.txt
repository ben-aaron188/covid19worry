I feel anxious as I don’t know when we will be released from quarantine. I also feel anxious as I don’t want any of my family members to become ill. It is quite nerve racking, I’m also hoping that   we will be back out by summer time. I don’t want a summer to go to waste. I hope that at the moment, everyone is okay because it would be difficult to deal with any sort of illness right now. I’m also quite angry about the people who are going out as they are compromising the safety of others and also prolonging the quarantine time; this is giggly agravating.
