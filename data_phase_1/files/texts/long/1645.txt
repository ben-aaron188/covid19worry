I am relatively calm compared to the general population, although I am a little saddened by the situation and deaths that are occurring. I feel that at a time like this, everyone needs to pull together and stop blaming the government for their failures. I am also very anxious as I do not know what to expect in the near future; for instance, will my father bring the virus back home after going shopping? What about my university situation? My university accomodation contract has now been cancelled with a refund for the final term, but my possessions are still there and I cannot collect them until the lockdown is over.
