I am quite concerned about the current epidemic. I hope that my family and loved ones will be okay and that no one I know loses their lives to the virus. 
I am also worried about the economic impact this crisis will have on the country. I am concerned my employer could make me redundant as a result of this. 
I hope life as we know it resumes before too long as I fine the confinement period a little difficult. I have not seen my family and friends for a while now and hope to be able to see them again soon.
