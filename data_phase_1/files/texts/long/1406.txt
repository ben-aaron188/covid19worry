I feel quite anxious and worried about the whole situation. I worry about the health of my family,  especially if they have to go to hospital and have to die on their own. I have a grand son who has special needs. He has been waiting for 2 years for help and now we have no idea when he will get the help he needs. I worry about my daughter on her own with a special needs child 24 hours a day , 7days a week, i worry this will break her. I worry about y sons job , he has a young family to support and a wedding to pay for next year. I also worry about the whole economy of the country, i think we will be paying for this for a very long time.
