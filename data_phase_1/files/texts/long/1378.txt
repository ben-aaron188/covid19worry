I feel very angry that people are not compiling to the whole ‘lockdown’ situation - that also includes businesses that are not ready to pay their employers who have to work in the frontline (postmen/women, shop workers, nurses, caters, delivery workers etc). 
I’m fearful that my family may get it if they’re not careful because they HAVE to go into work. 
It’s not really social distancing and helping stop the virus if people are still going out to do their daily shopping or meeting in parks! 
I’m anxious, very anxious that everything is out of my hands and I cannot do anything to help. I don’t have medical skills to help with the NHS and even if I did, would I put myself and my family at risk because the government are not ready to provide the right PPE.
I hate that the government have left this situation for too long that now it’s spiralling out of control.
