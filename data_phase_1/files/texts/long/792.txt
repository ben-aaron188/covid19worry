I feel reasonably relaxed right now as it is a sunny afternoon,though I do think about how others are coping with this situation at hospital,the safety and welfare of the health workers and care for patients.
 My thoughts on people disregarding setout rules to follow,I am angry about people not listening and following government advice.Sure people want to break the rules,but that comes at a cost right now to many people as this virus can be highly infectious.I do my part to self isolate at home,as a family we only shop few times a week and make sure to keep to the social distancing measures as much as possible.I am mostly working at home now due to this situation.
