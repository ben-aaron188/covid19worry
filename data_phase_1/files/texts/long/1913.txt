I'm not really worried about the virus itself, but more about how the lockdown/ closure of businesses, etc is going to impact individuals, the country and the economy. I'm worried that this situation is going to go on for a long time. It's not really affecting me personally that much but I'm concerned about the impact it's having on my adult sons' financial and job situations.I don't watch TV myself and I get my news from non mainstream sources, but  I think there is a lot of fear about this whole situation and it's not being helped by the constant scaremongering by the newspapers and television.
