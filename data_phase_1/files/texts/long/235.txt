I mostly feel worried about the virus as it has not infected people I love. I am also angry about it because there are people who arent taking it seriously which is stopping it from dying out. There are still people who are going out and not staying at home in the middle of a pandemic. This frustrates me because I have spent the last 20 days at home and haven't even stepped foot outside when there are people going to parks and stuff. that's awful and it angers me so much. somebody in my family is also infected by this virus and seeing how easily it took her health frustrates me even more because there is nothing that I can do about it unfortunately.
