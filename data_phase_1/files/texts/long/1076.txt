i feel worried about my future, i dont know whats going to happen and when. the uncertainty makes me anxious. i also miss my friends and girlfriend which makes me sad. spending this much time at home is bad for my mental health. i want things to get better. i really feel for the people who are struggling during this time, with or without hte virus. its a terrible crisis and i hope it ends soon. im hoping it starts to get better but its hard to tell. i think it is meant to get worse before it gets better which is hard to process and im worried about that
