I feel frustrated from people not listening to the government advice and putting everyone else at risk. As someone with asthma, I’m also quite anxious when I do have to leave the house as I’m worried that people aren’t following the 2m guidelines. While at home I’m quite relaxed, as I have three other housemates so we’re keeping each other entertained. Being limited to my flat for the most part is fine, but can get frustrating. I feel that the news is sometimes helpful, but in other ways in exacerbating they anxious feelings as it seems relentless and often makes assumptions on where the death toll will be in days instead of based on real facts.
