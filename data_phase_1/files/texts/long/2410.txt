Boris has been taken to ICU so I feel apprehensive about that and I feel confused about how I’m supposed to feel and what I’m supposed to do during this time. I miss going to see my family and my birthday plans have been cancelled which I’m finding difficult. I am trying to use this time off to rest and recuperate but I’m finding it all so surreal and I feel like my mind is constantly racing - I don’t sleep later than 6.30/7am any more which I hate. My heart breaks for all those NHS workers who have been underfunded for so many years
