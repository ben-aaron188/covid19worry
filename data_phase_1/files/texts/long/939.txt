I feel more anxious since Boris has been hospitalised. I feel like this situation could have been avoided if stricter practices were adhered to in China. It feels like authorities knew that this could and would happen but for some reason we didnâ€™t prevent it happening. I understand that this was a difficult situation to handle but I am now fearful that this could easily happen again in the future and have we learnt if changed anything? Will the country recover from this? A lot of questions to be answered but only the future will tell us the answers.
