I feel very anxious about vulnerable members of my family and key workers within my family contracting the virus, I also feel trapped and stressed and sad with having to stay home, which leads me to feel guilty as I realise I am very fortunate to be in the position I am and a lot of people in my country are worse off in terms of their personal situations and finance and health. I also feel lonely as I am not able to see my significant other, or very old grandad as he is extremely high risk. I feel that it is extremely difficult to find motivation to complete day to day tasks such as exercise and university coursework, which is adding to my feelings of stress as I am a masters student and this coursework is important. I also feel extreme gratitude toward key workers and frontline healthcare staff, and wish there was more I could do to help without feeling so useless at home.
