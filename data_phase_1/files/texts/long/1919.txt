I'm mostly worried as to when I'll be able to see my family again as they live in another country and summer is the only period of time I can see them. If international travelling is not back to normal , it means that I will not reunite with my family for a whole year. Overall I feel calm because I live in ideal conditions in the UK, I continue working remotely, exercise daily, and live with a loving partner. So I cannot really complain about anything when I consider how tough it has been for other people. This comparison I think helps me to maintain appreciation and thankfulness for the kind of life that I live regardless of all the restrictions.
