At this moment I feel very angry about all the people that are still going out for reasons that are not necessary! I'm absolutely disgusted with how selfish people are being currently. We all need to stay in and play our part to get over this awful situation but people think they are above the rules and guidelines and this is really starting to piss me off! I fear that if people don't start behaving, then our right to go outside and exercise will be taken away and I know I will suffer mentally if this happens.
