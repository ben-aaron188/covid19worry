Very anxious in relation to my partner who has asthma and my holidays. As a key worker within the UK, I am placed at risk and although there is “working from home” I do have to travel to the office at times to support the service. It only takes one dose and I could die or those who I love and care for. I am currently not seeing my fiancé as he is asthmatic. I have not seen him for 3 weeks and this is difficult. 
The governments response has angered me in relation to the funding of self-employed people who knew the risks of being self-employed and yet the system will now pay for them.
