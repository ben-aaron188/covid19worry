I'm genuinely petrified about what the Coronavirus means for me and my family. I'm scared of catching it, but there's also a small part of me that's scared of NOT catching it - I know that if I don't catch it, this crippling fear will continue to live with me until I do. I'm also ashamed that some of my family seem to think the rules don't apply to them, because they're putting themselves, and me, at risk. I'm concerned by how long the lockdown will last for - I understand it's essential and personally have no issues with it, but I think the longer it lasts the less others will comply with it.
