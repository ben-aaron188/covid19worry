I feel anxious because  I have to go out to get the groceries. There is no online shopping available. I don't want to catch this and pass it onto my family, anyone can die from this not just the elderly and poorly. I worry about my husband's work because he is by far the bread winner, but I cannot control what is going to happen. I worry about going to the shops and you can never get everything you need, so you end up having to go to several supermarkets several times a week instead of my usual two shops once a week. We are home all the time, we need more food but the shops have placed restrictions on how many of the same items you can purchase. I don't mind staying home for a short period of time to keep us safe, but I'm having to go out every couple of days to get food there by putting my family at risk.
