I'm upset at how the world is reacting to this. Most are following protocol and taking precautions but so many others are being selfish which increases my anger. As a future graduate I'm upset how this affects my ability to get a job, travel and work. I'm anxious because I don't know how things will be when it's over and we don't even know when things will go back to normal. I am an international student and being away from home and living in a high risk country is also stressful. I am angry for governments for not taking it seriously earlier on given we had so much time to prepare after China was hit.
