I feel most sad about future plans not happening in terms of summer. I miss my friends and human contact, going out and socialising was a big part of my life and well being. However on a positive note, it can sometimes be good to get out of routine, I like the sense of social solidarity and not having work to do. I find most frustrated when I see how it is affecting people differently, I worry about the increased domestic violence rates and it upsets me when people get angry at those in parks when not everyone has a garden, people have children that need to go outside, we need to be responsible but not shame others.
