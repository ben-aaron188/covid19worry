My stepson has cystic fibrosis which is on the very vulnerable list. I'm really scared he'll catch it as its very serious for him if he does. I wish everyone would listen to the rules and stay indoors. This will go on a lot longer if people dont do as they are told and follow the rules.
I'm currently working from home 6 days a week and it's very depressing. I cant wait for this to be over and back to in the office and socialising. Its very isolating. I've had to stop watching the news every day as it just got me too upset.
