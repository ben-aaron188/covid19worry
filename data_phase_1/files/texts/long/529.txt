I am concerned for people who are vulnerable especially my 94 year old mother-in-law who lives in a nursing home. I am disappointed for my 16 year old daughter who will not be able to sit her GCSEs. Overall I am not overly concerned for my immediate family and an enjoying a short break from work and imposed downtime. I will be happy when normal life resumes. I am u settled not knowing how exam results will be awarded. On s personal level I wish I had clarification as to whether our family holiday in July will go ahead.
