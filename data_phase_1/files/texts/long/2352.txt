Whilst being more accustomed with the measures taken to slower the rate of infection, which is leading to being able to relax more easily, there’s a constant undertone of anxiety and fear exacerbated by    news bulletins and social media. It’s hard to see how this will end and my own personal job security remaining in tact. I worry particularly about the health of my parents and grandparents, but hopefully their self-isolation will help with this. Despite the underlying anxiety and fear, I’m altogether quite happy. I feel very lucky to have a loving girlfriend who has helped greatly and whose company I’ve enjoyed. The situation is bringing us closer together.
