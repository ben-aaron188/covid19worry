I feel slightly frustrated about the lack of preparation for the virus. I'm worried about how the virus will impact the economic state of the country and job availability because of this. I'm scared the virus will effect older members of my family, and really, anyone else I call a family member or friend because as the days go by, the original information given seems less real. The only real positive I can takeaway from it is the increase in familiarity with people, and the creative outlooks people are taking because of it.
