I feel worried for vulnerable people around us who could be severely affected by Coronavirus. I am worried that many people arenâ€™t abiding by the lockdown restrictions. I am anxious that no-one in our household gets the virus as my husband is vulnerable. I am trying to limit how much I go out but I really feel the burden of anxiety when I go to do the food shopping and try so hard not to touch things, to make sure I disinfect everything and reduce the chance of any infection being passed on. I would feel awful if I was to bring the virus into our household.
