I feel very anxious about the whole situation. people are being selfish by going out to socialise and aren't looking out for themselves or others. it makes me worried how long we will be in this lockdown situation. I am classed as a key worker so am still having to go to work - nursery based. this makes me really nervous when around the children as who knows who may be a carrier of the virus. my partner and I are self isolating together and I am, at times, dropping essentials off to my parents and grandparents who are both considered as high risk.
