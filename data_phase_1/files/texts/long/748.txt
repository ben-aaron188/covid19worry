I feel anxious and out of control of the situation 
I feel angry that people aren’t listening to the social distancing rules 
I feel annoyed that people are still panic buying and being selfish 
I feel anxious if me or any of my family members get ill
I feel anxious that the family I live with may not wash their hands properly or be as strict with their hand hygiene as I am - therefore putting themselves and me at greater risk 
I feel sad that people are dying 
I feel uneasy because I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future 
I feel a lack of motivation as I’m having to do my uni work at home and I’m worried this will effect me graduating
