I feel like several countries are not taking the whole situation as seriously as they should. Governments are trying too hard to save money but do so by putting everyone's lives at risk. For example, Sweden does not appear to take the situation seriously enough, allowing people to move freely from Sweden to bordering countries. This will put both Swedish citizens in risk, killing many, as well as spreading the virus to neighbouring countries who may already have put more stringent rules in place. People will die because of cowardly behaviour from the government and it makes me very angry thinking about it.
