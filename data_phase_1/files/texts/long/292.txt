i am not directly affected by the coronavirus however catching up and staying motivated to do uni work at home is incredibly difficult. most days i feel useless and from that feel anxious. if i had no work to do, although i would be bored sometimes, i think in general i would be happier to just take time off doing work. i feel alarmed at people not using social distancing rules as being back from uni is the perfect opportunity to see friends, its something i am unable to do. the lack of direction from the gov and unis is alarming.
