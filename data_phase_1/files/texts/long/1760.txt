I am anxious that a family member may contract the virus as I have a close relative who is a ""key worker"".

I initially worried about how the government is acting upon setting up measures to try and prevent fast spreading, however they have recently in my opinion made far better and faster decisions in trying to tackle the current situation.

I am also grateful towards all NHS staff for their efforts in fighting off the pandemic and everyone around the UK for abiding by the government's advice to stay at home.
