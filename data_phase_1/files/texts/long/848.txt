I am concerned how long it will be when life gets back to normal and can get back to work. I am also worried for the NHS and am very annoyed with the idiots who do not abide by the lockdown restrictions  which will make the situation a lot worse . There should be higher fines imposed on these individuals and they should be named and shamed . I live in hope that a cure is found soon so that we live again without fear . When this is over China should be hold accountable for trying to earlier trying to cover this up and sanctions should be imposed on them and also a lockdown of travel overseas if they do not make sure all wet markets are shut down .
