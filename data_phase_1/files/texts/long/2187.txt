I am feeling very anxious at the moment about COVID-19 I am worried about my family and friends. I am also struggling with not being able to see my family and friends at the moment. I am also feeling anger for people that are continuing to ignore the lock down rules and how important these are. I also work in a hospital as admin staff and I am experiencing anxiety the days that I have to go in in work as I wish I could stay in the house with my family and stay safe. I am looking forward to when this situation is over and we can see our loved ones.
