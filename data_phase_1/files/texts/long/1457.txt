I feel sad for those who have died and their families primarily. Personally I feel anxious for myself though am hopeful that I will escape it through distancing and wearing PPE when out in public. I hope/think that if I was to contract it I would have done before the lock down and have no symptoms as yet so think/hope I've missed the most personally risky part. I'm happy to see the numbers of those who have died fall over the past couple of days in the UK and hope that this trend continues. I'm glad that the virus also seems to have created a sense of unity in the community and country to a degree and hope that this will continue though I'm not too hopeful.
