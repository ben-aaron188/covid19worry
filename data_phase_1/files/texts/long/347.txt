Forced to stay at home and not go anywhere.
I constantly worry about my parents.
I very worry about my work. I may lose my job because of this epidemic. I am afraid of losing my savings. The stores lack food. I am afraid our medical system may not cope with many patients
I have a state of constant anxiety because of the epidemic.
I'm worried about my family.
This epidemic reminds me of some horror movies. People become like zombies. Nobody wants to talk. A complete mess!
And what happens next no one knows. God help us
