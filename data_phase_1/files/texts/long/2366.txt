I feel really anxious and concerned about the way the country is handling this. Effects on the mental health of people as well as the economy will be really difficult, if even possible, to combat when this is over. The government is keeping us in suspense and giving very little out. They are not keeping us informed, they make statements that do not actually mean anything, e.g. they told us that boots and amazon would stock tests for individuals and that this was days away but now two weeks on or so, there is no sign of any sort of progress. They are avoiding questions and responsibility for their actions which caused this epidemic to worsen.
