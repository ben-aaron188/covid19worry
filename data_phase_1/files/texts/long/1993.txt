I feel very anxious about catching the virus whilst I am either working as a teacher or while shopping at the supermarket.  I am frightened about catching it and spreading it to my husband and children at home.  I also feel sad thaT I cannot see my extended family and sad that the whole world is so different. I am hopeful though that the actions That my and I family are helping to improve the situation. I constantly feel anxious when I go out to the supermarket because although I am taking precautions, not everyone is doing the same.
