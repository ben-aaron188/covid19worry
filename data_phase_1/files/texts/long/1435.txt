I feel anxious about the fact that we don’t know when this will end but I mostly feel sad for everyone affected by this and losing their lives and loved ones. I am incredibly proud of the country and particularly the NHS and I am determined to try and use this time as a positive time to get things done and to refresh. I think it’s important that people follow government advice as it will allow this to be over sooner and it disgusts me that some don’t seem to be listening. I pray that this all ends soon and that life can go back to normal but I also want to make sure I use this time wisely and don’t fall out of a routine
