I feel deeply saddened for the lives that have been lost all around the world. i have a lot of anxiety regarding myself and family's health especially those who have underlying health conditions. I'm scared about what might happen to the economy as a result of the coronavirus such as interest rates local business and how it will impact all of our lives. I'm stressed about how the gcse cancellations will affect my daughter, but i am trying to be thankful for the time in lockdown that I've been given with my children and partner, but frustrated with people who are not following the rules.
