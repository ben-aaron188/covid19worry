I am anxious about how badly the situation will impact millions of people globally, about how many people will die and lose their livelihoods. I worry about becoming infected, or my family and friends being infected, especially those who are older. I am afraid of how some governments will take advantage of the situation to forward their own agenda, and how this could impact people for years to come. I am frustrated that people do not seem to be taking lockdown measures seriously, while others are suffering and dying.
