I don't feel particularly worried. It's not the worst pandemic to befoul the world and things will get sorted in time. We just have to calm down, follow the guidelines as much as possible, and it'll be over and done with at some point. If there is one thing I do somewhat worry about though, or rather feel slightly contemptuous about, it's the thoughtlessness and selfishness of food hoarders. I can't abide how stupid they're being, how they deprive others of food, and how their overzealousness has caused needless wastage of food.
