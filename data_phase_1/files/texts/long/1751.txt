I feel sad about the people who are ill and have died. The situation doesn't seem to be improving. all the people out of work. The world is going to be in a right state when everything gets back to normal. Airlines, Travel companies, pubs and shops will all go out of business.  I am sick of lock down. it is boring nothing open nowhere to go. The weather is nice now and all you can do is sit in the garden .I hope the situation improves soon or everyone is going to go crazy. It is hard to keep busy and I hate sitting around doing nothing, Watching TV. The days just drag.
