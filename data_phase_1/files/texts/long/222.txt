Feelings about the situation have peaks and troughs. Sometimes I worry about leaving the house, sometimes I don't. Should we where masks? I own one but I have no idea if it is overkill.

I have no trust in the numbers told by every government, I believe it is much much more. I really do hope loads of testing happens very soon so the numbers can show that the mortality rate is lower

Family members with illnesses such as asthma worry me. Also knowing many people who work in care or in a hospital are struggling to get safety equipment and this makes me angry
