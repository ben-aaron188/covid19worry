I do my best to keep away from others but then I see others in groups that are not family and this makes me mad. I also feel that if the PM IS NOT WELL HE SHOULD HAND OVERVTO THE SECOND IN COMMAND and get himself better. I also feel that we should take better care of our health workers, giving them the proper equipment for there protection. I am now worried that pets can possibly catch the virus and pass it on the humans. It is a worrying time for everyone and I worry when I will see my family anD friends . I also worry about them all.
