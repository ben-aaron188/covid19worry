Right now I feel that Corona is scary due to there being no cure. There is still unknowns as to how to stop it spreading and everyone is at risk. This makes me feel nervous about going out of the house even to exercise or get essential shopping. I am scared that someone I know will get it or worse die from it. I wish for this to be over and for no-one else to become unwell or die but I know realistically that will not happen. You worry for your friends, family and the people they know. Ultimately someone you know will know someone that has had it.
