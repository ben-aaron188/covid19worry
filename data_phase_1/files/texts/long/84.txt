I feel like people aren't taking it serious enough. I worked in a pharmacy for 7 years and I want everyone to know how bad these things can be. Social media doesn't help at all.
Seeing President Trump expose himself as someone who doesn't really think about the lesser off persons is a sad thing. I have friends in America who are from China and feel personally attacked every time he takes the stage. There's so many things that I want to tell them but the isolation prevents it. I can't understand how anyone believes anything that he says. Not listening to doctors advice, lying to the press and seemingly still having the support of any seems mind boggling to me.
