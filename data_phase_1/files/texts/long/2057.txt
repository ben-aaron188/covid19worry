I at first wasn't all too worried. I am not worried still about the situation but I am frustrated and annoyed at everything regarding it.
People out there not taking it seriously, my abilities to cope with the situation.
It's all very stressful and I do not anticipate it clearing up any time soon.
If only I had some close relationships at the moment, but isolation is a tricky business and I'm bored.
I can understand why some things have to be the way it is currently, like businesses shutting and certain curfews that are in place, but in reality there's very little long term planned for the craziness when it sets in.
I feel like most of the higher ups are lying to us about certain things, like for example number of cases in particular countries, is it more? Perhaps.
Will my mental health be fine at the end of it all? I do not mean to be selfish, but I can only care about myself in the immediate.
