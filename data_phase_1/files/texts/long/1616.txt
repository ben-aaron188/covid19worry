At the moment I feel a sense of anxiety about what is happening in society based on this Corona situation. 
I am thankful for all the hard work that nurses are doing across the UK (and the wider world) and how they are saving lives.
I have been watching the news daily to keep updated about the current situation. 
However, I have felt a sense of unease whenever I have visited a supermarket for essential shopping. Although I am thankful that most people are following the guidelines that have been set out by the government and are maintaining a safe social distance.
