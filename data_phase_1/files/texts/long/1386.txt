I feel fearful of catching it and for the future. I feel anxious being at work at these times. I feel sad for the loss of life. I feel anger of the people ignoring the guidelines. But i am also relieved and happy to be alive and my family too.
No one knows what the future holds but there must be repurcussion of the chinese government for letting the virus loose and not telling anyone about it.
I am hopeful for the day that this is all over and hopefully society can rebuild and maybe people will be better and governments better equipped in the future for possible like things being spread globally.
