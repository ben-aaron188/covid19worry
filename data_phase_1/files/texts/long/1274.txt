I am worried about what the economy will be like once this is all over.  I am also worriedd about how this will effect my business and whether I will be able to bounce back once lockdown measures are relaxed. I am feeling annoyed about the fact that I'm stuck inside and I can't follow my normal routines, but understand that it is necessary. I am worried about the safety of close people who have underlying health conditions. I am Mildly scared about contracting the virus myself, but I am healthy and young so know that the chances of me having any serious complications if I do are fairly low.
