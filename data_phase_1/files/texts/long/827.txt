I am worried that a large part of society is not respecting the lockdown and that makes me afraid more people will suffer as a result.

I am afraid that my family or I may get it and what if we have underlying conditiond we are not aware of. 

Also, its impossible to get medical care for anything else at the moment... I have had issues that have not resolved for three weeks and still have another week to wait on a blood test they told me I will be turned away from if I have a temperature... I have a suspected infection... So my temp is higher... I am afraid I will get ignored.
