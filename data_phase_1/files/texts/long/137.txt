I think that this current pandemic is absolutely crazy and mind blowing as this is something that none of us is used to. I appreciate what Boris has been doing however he has still been working despite being ill and been in areas less than 2 meters of others which is not setting a good example. This is a horrible situation for us all and creates such an anxious feeling amongst us all, the best thing for us all is to stay in although some are not keeping to this therefore the government and policing should be a lot more stricter to keep it at a low. It has caused a lot of stress on people and I canâ€™t wait for this all to be over and everyone to be recovered.
