I am in week 3 of 12 due to health issues. I suffer anxiety and depression. Today has been a bad day as stress and poor sleep patterns are taking its toll. I do not fear the virus even though I am high risk but the tension and need to do something is getting too much. I  have no doubt the world will survive and there will be changes, I think we will live more like we did when I was a child in the 70's and 80's, much simpler with more emphasis on balancing home and work. The ridiculous so called celebrity culture of 4th rate nobody's has been seen for what it is.
