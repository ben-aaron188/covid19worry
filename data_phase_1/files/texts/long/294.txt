Ok in the short-term, concerned in the longer term. Annoyed I don’t qualify for government support due to caring responsibilities. Wary of the longer term - how will we get out of this?

Glad to have a garden and to have been able to afford food. Lucky to be living with others who I get on with.

I also feel slightly surreal as it all feels almost unbelievable. It probably hasn’t sunk in yet what it really means.

Glad to have time to get on with things in the house and to have good and kind neighbours. Concerned for others who are more vulnerable. Concerned for the future and for the impact on the next generation
