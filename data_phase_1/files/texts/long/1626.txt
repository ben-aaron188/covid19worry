I’m frustrated at people that are still going out and meeting friends after being told by the government; because I’m doing my bit by staying indoors yet they’re jeopardising people’s futures by going out.  I’m anxious for the future and what that holds, and how my studies and life will be affected but I’m hopeful that it won’t all be bad and that we can get through this strongly if everyone works together.  I’m happy at how seriously the majority of people are taking this, and I’m so thankful of the work of the NHS as without it we would of been struggling much worse than any other country.
