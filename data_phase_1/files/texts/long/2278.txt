I am self isolating and feel that everyone should do the same.  I have ensured that my family near and extended have been following guidelines.  By using Facetime and phone calls and texts I have been able to happily exist and work without any anxiety.  I am concerned about my parent as they are older but have reinforced the seriousness of this global situation.  Patience is the key and having an understanding of how the UK is affected will assist in keeping everyone calm.  If anything, this situation will forge or rekindle social unity which may have been sadly lacking in the UK for some time now.
