The loss of life is tragic.  So many people dieing before their time.  Evenvworse is that theyare dieing alone witjout the support of their loved ones, family and friends.
The people working in and supporting the NHS are wonderful. It must be desperatly draining and tiring for those working on the front line in hospitals.
On a personal level, I find the lockdown boring and tedious, but fully understand and support it.
People need to stay at home.
 Feckless people who don't observe social distancing make me cross. This includes those that are inconsiderate in supermarkets and shops.
