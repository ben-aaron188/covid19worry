At the moment I'm really worried about the current Covid-19 situation. I'm trying to occupy myself and keep busy doing different things around the house, and not watch too much of the news so that I hear less about it. I find that the more I read about it, the more worried and anxious I get. I become more anxious when I have to go to the supermarket and am in close proximity with other people there, especially when they aren't following the social distancing rules. My partner is a key worker and is still interact with people, so I fear that he may contract it and bring it home.
