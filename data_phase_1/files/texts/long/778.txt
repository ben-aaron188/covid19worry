I'm constantly anxious that I may have the virus and pass it on to others. I have existing health conditions so I don't know what 'well' feels like. I'm often wondering if this is a regular symptom or a vivid symptom. It breaks my heart seeing the destruction that this has already caused and I'm extremely worried about my family. I miss them so much and really took seeing them for granted. I feel there is a pressure to be really productive and do lots of things during lockdown but I just cant find the motivation. It makes me angry seeing people breaking the guidelines and not being concerned with spreading it. I wish everyone could understand and care.
