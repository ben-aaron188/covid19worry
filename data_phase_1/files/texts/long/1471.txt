I feel constantly terrified - I work in the media so spend my days working from home which involves trawling all the bad news that's out there right now. My mum is a supermarket worker so I'm scared of her bringing something home from work - we're practicing bio-hazard procedures when she comes in. I'm angry at my life being put on hold and deeply sad due to how much I miss some of the people in my life. I haven't felt at ease or relaxed for weeks - it's been hard to stay motivated whilst working because of how on edge I am, it's impossible to stay focused.
