I just feel sad and disappointed that my life is basically on hold, it makes me feel lonely and with nothing to look forward to. And makes me feel anxious about the future because it has come at a bad time in terms of my training contract at work and also a new relationship I had just started. I also miss my family and am worried about them getting ill or being lonely, particularly my grandma.  However, there are some days where I do feel more relaxed and chilled out. I am getting frustrated at not being able to go outside or enjoy the sunshine or go and sit in a pub garden or have a happy hour cocktail, especially as the weather is now getting warmer. However, I understand why we have to do it and that it is necessary and that everyone is in the same boat. It is just a strange and surreal feeling to live through this event
