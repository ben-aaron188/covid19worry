At the moment in time I Feel worried about the virus. Because recently I have felt a bit under the weather and I immediately panic thinking it could be the coronavirus but in fact it's just a sore throat and it's made me feel more anxious. Being around people when I go for essentials has also made me feel weary of them, I just hope that in the couple of weeks the news start to explain better news more positive to give the world hope again. I do like the fact that neighbours have came together again and the world is healing itself
