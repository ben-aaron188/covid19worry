I feel sad for the people and families who will lose their lives.  I also feel some worry about how the future will pan out and the impact of this situation in regards to people's healths, jobs etc.  I also feel hope that we will get through this situation and that hopefully there may be some good that comes of it such as more money in the nhs and recognition of keyworkers.  To an extent I feel relaxed in that I am working from home and les stressed due to not having to commute, having a lesser workload and more time at home.
