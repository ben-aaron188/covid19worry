I think it is a good time for people to rethink their lives, career choices, and financial situations.  People will be able to relax and spend time with their household.  It is scary but only positive thinking will get us further than we were.  We have to work together against it and follow guidelines.  I don't think people will necessarily think about things the same way as they did pre coronavirus.  People's lives and the way we view things could be drastically changed after this.  People should be focused on their health and wellbeing at this time and be reminded that refocusing on what they want should be first and foremost.
