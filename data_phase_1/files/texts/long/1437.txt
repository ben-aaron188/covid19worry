Very anxious about it and if you get it how bad it will be and the resources available to help you. I’m worried also about my family and how they will cope. It’s a very worrying time for everyone. Also I don’t know if part of the media reports is scaremongering. It’s hard to know what to believe.  Not sure what else I can write in this topic really. I do worry about how long lockdown will be for. I am wanting to get back to the gym again see my friends, also I want my daughter to be able to see her friends back at school before she starts her new school in September.
