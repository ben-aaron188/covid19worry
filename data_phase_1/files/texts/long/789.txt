I feel quite sad about all the situation with coronavirus. I a bit disappointed with government's decision and their guidelines. I think that they should act quicker.
I feel that I can't do things which I used to do before all that situation. I worry about my parents and other family. I worry about economy..what is going to happen after.
I am still full of hope that everyone will be better soon. I try to stay positive and support my husband and look after my children  and don't show them my weaknesses.
