I am sad and shell shocked at the global level of death. I am worried for the economy, both locally, regarding local jobs, and globally, including my pension investments. I am concerned about how we come out of this crisis and worry how we regain our confidence to go out into society and mix. I think everyone has to be vaccinated for it to end. I am impressed at how my community has come together to help the vulnerable, I hope we learn lessons as a society on how to be kinder to our neighbours.
