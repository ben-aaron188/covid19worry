I feel unsettled predominantly because it’s not clear how the whole situation will eventually pan out. I struggle to work out whether I’m more concerned that I may get the infection and potentially become seriously unwell and die or whether I’m more worried that the same thing will happen to one of the people I love most in my life. I also Feel angered by the people who are ignoring the government’s instructions on social distancing and giving the appearance that they don’t care whether or not they may be responsible for infecting and potentially killing another person.
