I am sick of this virus...I have been unwell due to coronavirus, I spent almost 3 weeks being unable to breath due to this, and I am now sick of lockdown and sick of constant tv updates regarding this virus, I want life to go back to normal.I feel scared that my elderly family members will contract this disease. I want to return to my normal life however I understand that this may not be allowed to happen for the foreseeable future. I wish our government had taken advise from scientists when they were first warned about this and spent our money on properly preparing for this obvious pandemic rather than spend money on useless things
