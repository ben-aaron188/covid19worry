I am worried about losing my job. My emotions and those of my family are all over the place. We are all scared and worried about the future. Iâ€™m also struggling being at home and this is getting me down. There does not seem to be an end in sight and I am worried how long this situation could go on for. The future looks quite bleak and where we go from here, I do not know. If we had a deadline or an end in sight, I think this would help a lot of people although I understand that this is a difficult thing to predict and communicate.
