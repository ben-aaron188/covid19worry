I generally feel ok. My husband is a key worker and so has to go into peoples homes who are self isolating in order to fix their gas/electric. It is that that causes me anxiety. The fear that he may catch the disease and then bring it home to me and the children. I am dealing with the isolation fine though. Me and the kids have not left the house in 15 days now but we are lucky in that we have a large garden to get outside. I worry for my grandparents and my husbands grandparents. I miss my parents; I usually see them twice a week and this is now the longest time I have gone without seeing them. We are FaceTiming everyday so that is helping and helps the children.
