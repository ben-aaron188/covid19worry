Me and my family feel very uncertain at this moment in time, however we are very aware that the most we can do is to stay home and follow government guidelines. I am feeling a sense of relaxation and I am able to connect with my family a lot better than I usually would which is a positive. 
There is a part of me that is feeling a sense of unity as it is great to see the whole of our nation work together to overcome this. Although many are taking this seriously, many people are still not taking this seriously, and are continuing their daily life like nothing is going on, leaving me feeling angry and annoyed at times. 
Overall, I am slightly worried about the situation but I feel as though this will improve over the next few weeks/months.
