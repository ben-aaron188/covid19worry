At the moment I feel mostly bored trying to find something to occupy my time as I cannot work from home, however not being able to go out doesn’t bother me as I am an introvert. 
 
I am feeling a little uneasy about money, although right now I feel like I have enough to get me through the next few weeks.

I don’t feel scared or worried for myself or my health but I do feel worried for other people, mainly older relatives and friends. 

I dislike the uncertainty of not knowing when things will begin to get back to normal. I feel there is a lack of information from those in charge and this leads me to believe that they don’t know either
