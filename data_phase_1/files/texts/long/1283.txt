I am feeling tired and angry because being at home for this long and isolating myself in my current household stresses me out too much. Also, I feel as if I need to do something so I get anxious. I feel this lockdown will help in reducing numbers however this lockdown is putting strain on households and relationships within the household. I am not scared of the virus or it does not make me feel anxious. It's just the knock on effect it has had on all the things we take for granted (and I totally understand that).
