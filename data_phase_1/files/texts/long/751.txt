It is very worrying both for health reasons and for the long term economic impact. I feel the government is doing all it can to scare people and make them accept the draconian restrictions on civil liberties. People should be given some indication of that the exit strategy from the lockdown will be and when it will happen. For once I agree with Trump that the Coronavirus cure cannot be worse than the problem itself"". It does not make sense to implement a policy with no clear plan to get out of the situation. As someone said, the government appears to have painted itself into a corner.
