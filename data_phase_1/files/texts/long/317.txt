I currently feel sad about the whole Corona situation, mainly because it's meant I'm currently unable to see my university friends. It's also restrictive and limiting to what I can currently do as a filmmaking student, purely because I can't fully get certain film concepts created for one of my student short films as it requires going out and filming in various environments. As a result of this, it's meant I feel a lot more restricted in what I can and can't do for my final part of first year, and whether or not I will ever have the chance to actually do what I wanted for the course itself.
