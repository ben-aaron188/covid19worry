The current situation is making me feel anxious and I feel very on edge when going outside for exercise or to buy supplies. I am fearful of the impact it will leave on mine and other peoples lives and how the country will cope after this pandemic. I miss going about my daily life and am upset that I took it for granted. I have been feeling very irritated due to spending so much time around my family and being unable to have some quiet time to myself. I am angry to see that some members of the public haven't been following the new rules set by the government.
