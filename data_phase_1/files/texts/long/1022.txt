Iâ€™m extremely anxious and scared about the Coronavirus and the impact it will have on the world. I am worried about my elderly family getting the disease. I am worried about taking my son to the shop for food in case he touches anything. I also feel anxious about how long the lockdown will last and the effect staying at home will have on my mental health as well as a lot of others mental health. The world will be a very different place after this and society will have to learn to adapt. Also I am worried about properties and moving as I am meant to do so soon and wonder how this will be impacted.
