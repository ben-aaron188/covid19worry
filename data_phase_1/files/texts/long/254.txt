I am more concerned about the future for the young and the risk to that from crashing the economy essentially to save the very old.  The intergenerational unfairness was huge before this crisis.  It's will be much worse afterwards I fear.  The lockdown is far worse for the poor too.  All other health issues which affect younger people are not getting treated properly any more.  This is very sad.  Pretty unfair too.  The young have not had their life chances unlike the old.  And our future depends on them.  Life expectancy will plummet as a result of this lockdown.  Stopping ordinary life with the idea that we can save everyone vulnerable is misguided.
