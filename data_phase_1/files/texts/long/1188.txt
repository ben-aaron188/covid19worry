I have had a chronic illness that has left me housebound and often bedbound for ten years. Last month my partner of nearly 9 years ended our relationship as she did not want to look after me any longer. I am living on a friends floor as i have no money and no accommodation. Nobody recognises my illness as it is not understood, even by the medical profession. Believe me when i say, i could not care a jot about the corona virus. People were selfish and ignorant before the virus, they will continue to be ignorant after all this is over.
and i will still be in bed . . .
