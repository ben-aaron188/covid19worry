Feeling hopeful today as the number of deaths has fallen over the weekend. I am trying to avoid any negative news and focusing on my immediate home environment. Feeling okay and that we are gradually getting through this. I am making sure we laugh everyday, eat well and get out for a walk every day. It's important to look forward and be positive in your own mind. No point in dwelling on the bad news. Keeping busy with work and around the house is really helpful. Making sure we enjoy the small things like the sun being out and drinking a good cup of tea.
