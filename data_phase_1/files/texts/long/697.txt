I feel very anxious and worried about the future. I feel upset that I cannot see my family, other than my mother who I live with. I feel like it's going to go on longer then any of us are currently expecting and this worries me greatly. I feel scared that some of my family may catch the virus and possible die, especially my grandparents who are old and currently sick. I know that I won't be able to see them for 12 weeks which is upsetting. It's currently everywhere and unavoidbable no matter where you look. It's online and on the television constantly which means you can't get away from the constant stress and anxiety it causes.
