The main concern for me is the financial impact of being furloughed and only earning 80% of my wage. The company I work for is very small and so is at risk of folding as a result of everything being closed. I am not too worried about catching the virus as for most people it's just a moderate illness, but the knock on effects such as losing my job puts me in a state of uncertainty and worry. However, there is solace in the fact that many other people are going through the same or similar problems - so I am not alone. This is not something that affects just me, but the majority of the population.
