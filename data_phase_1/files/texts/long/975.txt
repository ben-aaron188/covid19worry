Fairly optimistic about the likelihood of this being got under control and finding a vaccine. I am trying to see the positives of social distancing: more time with the family, together. At least its Spring and the days are longer and weather warmer. A little nervous for my parents who are elderly and saddened for those who have lost loved ones. Gratefull and awestruck by the work of the NHS and the others putting themselves in harm's way. All in all it will be ok, we have dealt with worse as a species -  it's not 1346, after all.
