I am relatively worried about how the virus may possibly spread, not only for my loved ones but others in my community who may be at risk. I believe we must delay everything else until the virus is completely removed as it is a huge threat to human civilizsation. In addition, it disgusts me how people are not following the recommended guidance of the government and therefore not obeying the rules and going out unnecessarily and meeting up their friends. In order to protect our future we must follow the government guidance and stay put for the time being.
