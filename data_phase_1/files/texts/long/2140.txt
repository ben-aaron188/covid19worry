I'm feeling annoyed that people don't seem to be taking a global pandemic seriously enough to just stay at home, however I do understand why that can be hard for some people. I'm worried about the impacts of COVID-19 - financially, on our health, the economy as a whole, how people will recover from it, but more so - how long will this last for? Lives are being put on hold (or sadly lost) and we have no idea when we will get back to 'normal' or what that will even look like. How long can people continue like this? What if we think it's 'over' and end up spreading it even more because we relax all the rules too quickly?
