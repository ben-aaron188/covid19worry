Previously I’ve been scared that my mum who’s a key worker might catch this and not be able to fight it. I’m not worried about catching it as hopefully I’m relatively young and strong. I’m angry with all of the people who have no regard for lockdown rules. Today it’s been announced our prime minister is in intensive care although I’m not a fan of him or his political party, it brings home that nobody is safe and I feel sad for his pregnant fiancé and children. I feel it’s a very unknown situation that we’re dealing with and people at still not taking into account how dangerous it is and think it’s just a common cold. From a selfish point of you I’m also sad for all of the things people aren’t able to do and celebrate this year like weddings, big birthdays and family celebrations. I also feel sad for all of the people who are dying alone.
Finally I feel anxious on a personal level for my own job and if that’ll be safe during this time. There are also the financial implications that we’ll be dealing with for a long time.
