I am very anxious about how Coronavirus is going to leave our country. I am worried as i have some vulnerable members of the family. I also fear when my mum leaves for work as she works in a pharmacy and is dealing with ill people everyday even if they are after some paracetamol or some sickness bug tablets. i havent left the house is 15 days and cant wait for all this to be over. I miss my family as i am having to FaceTime them and i have nieces and nephews who dont know who i am. I feel like the government are doing the correct thing and i back boris johnson in all his decisions. I am very annoyed at people that are still going out to visit family or gathering in peoples back gardens, as this is cancelling out what other people are doing to prevent spreading the virus.
