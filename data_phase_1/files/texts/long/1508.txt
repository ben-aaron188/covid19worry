I feel a bit more concerned and anxious than I did yesterday. Although the overall situation in England is following the trend I expected (or is, perhaps, better than that, as overall new cases and deaths are declining - I expected the peak to be next Tuesday), I heard today that a resident of my mother's sheltered accommodation complex had been taken to hospital last week, and has now tested positive for the virus. So I have to decide whether she should stay where she is, or move in with my wife and me. Either way has risks; but now staying put is considerably riskier than it appeared yesterday.
