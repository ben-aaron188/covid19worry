I feel anxious about the economic fall-out for the word and specifically how this might impact my personal situation.  I am not confident that the government are doing everything they can to prevent the situation worsening.  I do feel as if there are experts who are advising the that are knowledgable and making good decisions.  However, as the situation is unprecedented a lot of the planning being made is experimental in nature.  I have regret about decisions I have made that have put me in a precarious position to deal with this.  I am worried about the health of elderly relatives.
