I feel very on edge about the whole situation, the uncertainty of not knowing when life will return to normal. The never ending fear that i may lose a loved one to this disease. Seeing people my age contract this disease and fall victim to it. I can't wait for it all to go away. That's if it even does go away, how are we to know how long this will go on for. It's terrifying to know something that has the chance to kill you could be lurking at your local supermarket and you have no option but to visit to get groceries.
