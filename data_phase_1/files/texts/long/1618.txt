I am feeling angry about the fact that people are not following the government's guidelines for the situation and angry that the government seem to be doing little to enforce this. I think people are acting in a selfish manner and only thinking of themselves and not others, particularly those who are vulnerable. I am also feeling anxious about the unknown surrounding this situation and the financial state in which the country will be in once the virus passes. I hope in the near future the government will introduce stricter guidelines which will enable our country to get through this situation in the least damaging way possible.
