I am concerned that the true impact of the current situation is not fully understood and although the main focus at the moment is on the short term spread and death rate of the virus (which is of concern given a close family member works for the NHS) i am probably more concerned about the long term effects. Specifically the impact of the virus remaining the population and the potential for repeat outbreaks with resultant loss of life. I am also very concerned about the longer term impact on the economy, the impact of the government stimulus will have on future government spending, social support and tax requirements.  In particular I’m concerned that further rounds of austerity may be required, or that inflationary or deflationary pressures may arise which require further government intervention which may further impact our way of life.  Fundamentally I’m worried how the current situation may impact it will have on the world in which my children will grow up.
I also have some concerns over the potential for social unrest should the current measures be required to be in place for longer or require tightening.  I worry that this has the potential to impact our democratic way of life in the medium term.  
I guess I also have concerns about how governments have reacted to the situation and the potential for the rise of nationalism.
Lots to worry about and probably a bit depressing now I think about it.
