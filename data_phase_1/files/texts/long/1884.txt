The country is pulling together and working through the crisis well. Reading the daily updates of cases and deaths is uncomfortable however I believe the numbers are not easy to comprehend for many when simply presented as a figure. My employers response, I feel, is inappropriate. Expecting non urgent general maintenance tasks where social distancing is not possible to continue. This irritates me somewhat. It's unnerving to see Boris Johnson taken into hospital. I can only assume this would not have been done if it wasn't absolutely necessary.
