At the moment I am very stressed and angry with the situation. I am a third year university student, and it has completely ruined the year; I can’t see my friends, graduation has been postponed etc. On top of this, we’re still expected to hand in our assignments with no extensions which is extremely stressful since we don’t have access to as many resources. As a member of staff at a supermarket, I am also at a higher risk of catching the disease and bringing it back to my family, and I feel as if the virus has brought out the worst in a lot of people.
