I feel like I am living in limbo due to the lockdown.  Everyday seems the same and it is kind of depressing.  I know it if for our own safety so I am happy to abide by it, but it is still making me feel really down.  Also I think the press and media are scaremongering and creating even more fear amongst the population.   I think it is the uncertainty of what is happening and what is going to happen which also creates fear and panic.  I just want this to pass and for life to return to normal as soon as possible.
