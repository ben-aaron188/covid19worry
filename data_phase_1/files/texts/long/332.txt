My father has just died of Coronavirus. I feel very upset and low. I am going on tablets to help me sleep. I feel how you would expect me to feel as it has killed my father. It is a very scary time. It is hard being in isolation. It is hard as I cannot go to the funeral and I don't think he stood a chance as the virus was so easy to catch and there is not a cure. I think that the news is always negative on the tv and it his hard to know who to believe and it is hard to know if it is ever going to get any better and I want it all to go away but I don't know when it will end.
