I feel worried and anxious although a sense of relief that having seen other european countries having reached peak that we will to. I know that this wont last forever and i cant control things outside my home but i can control my family and what is in my power to get through the worst. i feel the fear of the unknown is what is making it worse, not being able to plan things. i feel worried that when things to start to return to normal that im not sure how i will feel. i just want to be able to fast forward time when this wont consume my thoughts 24/7
