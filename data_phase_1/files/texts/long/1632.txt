I think it is a storm in a teacup to be honest. The UK Government has got it all wrong and current measures will cause more harm than good in the long term. My wife and I are having some well earned time off due to being furloughed so thoroughly enjoying the media circus playing out on the TV everyday. The coverage now has reached saturation level and in my opinion it will only be a matter of time before the Police overstep their boundaries and end up in some real trouble with public trust issues. Hopefully it will all be over soon and we can get back to getting out of the EU.
