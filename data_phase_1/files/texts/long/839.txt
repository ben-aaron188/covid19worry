I've tried to avoid the news due to having no interested in watching the death toll increase, but keep up with breaking news with alerts on my phone. I am currently self isolating and only leaving the house for essential journeys so I feel relatively safe from the virus, but I can't help but feel a little anxiety thanks to a major change in lifestyle that isolation requires and worrying about elderly family members that are high risk and struggling to come to terms with the governments requests to stay indoors - their routines have been ripped apart.
