The situation seems to be escalating towards its peak. I am concerned about the safety of those working for the NHS and frustrated that the government have not handled the situation as well as some other governments - that said, I'm glad they've taken the measures they have, I just don't feel like they were implemented quickly enough.

However, I feel very lucky and stable in my current employment/financial situation. We are a two income household, with no dependents, with two secure public sector roles.
