Feeling worried but not as much  as before as I have experienced symptoms, been ill, been to hospital and come out the other side. I am concerned for my mother who is 65 and a cafe worker with minimum PPE. We should be doing more to test, the response by the UK government has been terrible and I am angry about this. I am worried about working from for the foreseeable future, and I feel sad that I canâ€™t see my friends. I get very angry when I see others not sticking to the rules - they are extremely selfish and stupid.
