I am concerned to a certain degree, although I feel this has lessened since last week, and the week before, when I felt much more anxious. This anxiety and worry is generally about the unknown, i.e. how long this will last for and the effect it will have on my finances. I do also feel a little anxiety in catching the virus itself as the supermarkets are busy and its very difficult to keep socially distance.
I do feel this  anxiety has lessened in the recent days due to being proactive with finding alternative business ventures and looking at a more long term view instead of just the next month or so. This has made me feel more hopeful and excited about the future rather than fearful.
