Absolutely terrified, felt like I had coronavirus but was never tested for it. Deeply anxious and very isolated, feeling quite sad as well as th eWorld is at a standstill. Know many people through social media/news who have been infected etc and therefore more anxious than ever. Furthermore really scared about getting help for future medical hospital appointments, as it feels like there’s a greater risk of contracting it by attending those. Haven’t stepped out of the house in 3 weeks. Worried about university (it’s my final undergrad year). I’ve been furloughed from my work as well, so I’m poor right now.
