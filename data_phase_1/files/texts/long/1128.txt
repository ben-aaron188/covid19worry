Angry that once again a virus has arisen from the wuhan market, think it’s about time it should be shut down. It has caused a pandemic and yet it is still allowed to trade, these type of places should be made illegal.  I hope that they find a cure for corona soon as I dread to think how many more people are going to lose their lives over it, especially when people are not sticking to the rules of staying home. Don’t feel the government have done enough to make sure everyone knows what the rules are and the consequences if you don’t abide by them.
