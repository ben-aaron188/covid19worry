I'm worried mainly. Both for my own and my families safety. But also for what this future and when things might get back to normal. I'm also angry that it has gotten to this stage, and some people are still refusing to take it seriously and follow basic rules which will help protect their own safety and the safety of others. This includes anger towards the government for not reporting things more clearly, and also not preparing effectively for such an outbreak. I really just want things to get back to normal asap!
