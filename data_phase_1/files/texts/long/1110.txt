I am quite anxious at the moment as I have a partner living with me who is fairly high risk and I am scared I will pass the virus on to her as I have to go out for shopping and essentials. I have noted that quite a number of people are not observing the social distancing guidelines whilst I have been out for essentials and this leads me to becoming angry towards them. On a more positive note I have found the time stuck at home productive as I am able to catch up with things around the house and personally which I wasnâ€™t able to previously due to a busy lifestyle with work.
