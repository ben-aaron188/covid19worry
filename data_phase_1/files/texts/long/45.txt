I'm aware of how serious the situation is but the only thing I can do to help is not mix with people and maintain my hygiene. I am using any  days off duty to continue my personal education, learning, dog walks (whilst we can)and enjoying it, remaining positive throughout.
I am constantly baffled by those who find this difficult to comprehend. We are not in small prison cells, solitary confinement or suffering any hardship beyond vanity. That said, I do feel a little concerned for the elderly and infirm or those living in flats, without gardens.
