I worry about my work. I may lose my job because of this epidemic. I am afraid of losing my savings. The stores lack food. Permanent queues. I am afraid our medical system may not cope with many patients
I'm worried about my family.
I have a state of constant anxiety because of the epidemic.
Forced to stay at home and not go anywhere.
I constantly worry about my parents.
I do not like this situation, I am rather afraid of what will happen in the future.
It is very boring to stay at home without work
I feel quite anxious and afraid of what comes next.
