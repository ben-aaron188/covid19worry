I feel anxious for what is to come. I miss my family and knowing I’m not going to see them for a while yet. I hate that my husband has to go to work everyday as a key worker in a supermarket. He is risking his health and our health to do that, it worries me that he’ll bring the virus home. I can’t work due to the pandemic and I aren’t getting any ‘me’ time away from my 15 month old son. It’s full on having him every day all day alone. I some days feel like I haven’t achieved anything at all by just being in the house all day. I can’t do jobs around the house because he is very clingy and won’t nap unless it’s on me. I worry my husband will expect me to have things sorted - although he tells me he doesn’t. I worry about my elderly relatives and their mental health. Particularly my father in law who lives alone after my mother in law passed away 4 years ago. I FaceTime him every day but he misses his only grandchild and I hate that he’s lonely.
