I am extremely worried.  The government seems to be trying to pin the blame for any bad outcomes on the actions of a small minority of the population rather than the delayed response to the arrival of COVID-19 into the country (no tracing of contacts etc).  My recently widowed mother lives some way from us and is over 70 and having to shield.  She needs dental work but can't get it.  My Parents-in-law are also both over 70 and ex-smokers.  There doesn't appear to be any exit strategy to our current situation.  I fear my industry (classical music) will be utterly decimated by this and will never recover thus causing emotional and financial strain.
I worry about the impact this is having on my toddler who is suddenly no longer going to nursery / playing with the neighbours' children / visiting relatives or even going in the car!  We can't explain what is happening.
I have asthma which is usually mild but has been playing up this winter so I am especially worried about the possibiity of catching COVID-19.  I worry that it is impossible to self-isolate from the rest of the family in our small flat if one of us catches it (especially as I am still breastfeeding).  I also worry that the restrictions will tighten and not allow us to take our child outside for a daily walk - we have no garden and this is vital to our mental wellbeing.
I am also worried about friends who fall into the vulnerable category but live too far across London for me to be able to easily help them shield.
