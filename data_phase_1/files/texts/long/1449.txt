i  am worried and am lonely in the house on my own. I am worried about food being available and money to pay my bills. How long is this stay at home going to last? I am worried about automation and possible universal basic income. I can only hope they do not cut off the internet as it is the only means of me talking to someone and getting news. I am worries also for the old people as they are dropping off like flies. I also feel sad as I cannot talk to anybody which is not good as I am not in a good mental state.,
