I feeling sadness at this moment because of not having possibility of go out from home and meet with my friends.. A lot of people starting feel some kind of depression because of that, I think this situation can last at least to the summer, which doesen't sound good at all for isolate people. It's normal in this kind of situation and I was expecting this weeks back ago, but still, hard to live like this, in that way.. In next 6 months the situation should be definitely better then todays, considering almost 1,5mln infected people right now
