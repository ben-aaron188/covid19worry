I am angry people are not listening to lockdown although me and my family are. I am having to work through it and they are ignorant and do not care about my welfare.  I am anxious about the financial situation as i have money invested which has   gone down. I am young so not too worried 're my health but my son's mental health as he is not at school and he is asd and my father is alone and his wife stranded in australia and i have not been able to see him. My wife just started a new job so I'm worried about that.
