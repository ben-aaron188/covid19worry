I don't like lockdown and look forward to being free to go where I like. I am constantly confused by the statistics and analysis and am not totally convinced that this strategy is necessary although I comply with it. There is a background concern that I may get it despite all the precautions and I Sorry that members of my can't may become I'll.
It surprises me that there is not a global response in place for this pandemic since it has been a concern for the who.
I am also puzzled that countries like Germany are reporting low mortality rates whilst other European countries report much higher rates. It's the same virus and similar populations.
