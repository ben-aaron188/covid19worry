At this point in time, I am not overly worried about how the situation will affect me. I am content in working from home and staying inside the house. I am currently self-employed though so this will change depending on how long it lasts for. 

I am more anxious and worried about how this will affect life as we know it going forward and of course for everyone involved in this in a more direct way than myself i.e. NHS and key workers. Having this last at least 6 months could have catastrophic consequences on the whole world.
