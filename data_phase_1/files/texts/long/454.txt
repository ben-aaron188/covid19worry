I feel extremely sad being away from friends and family. Sad for others who are suffering and sad for all the people who have lost their lives or loved ones. I am nervous about what the future holds for everyone and worried about whether we will return to normal. Scared whether this will ever stop and how we will cope. Worried for all concerned. It is a stressful time for all but I also feel annoyed at those who are not sticking to the rules. Iâ€™m staying indoors and everyone else should too.  I have been quite emotional about the whole situation in recent days and I fear that it is going to get worse over the coming weeks
