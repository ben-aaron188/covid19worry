I am worried but not too much, I realise there is not much I can do apart from staying at home and getting on with my life, which I've been doing. I feel relaxed but sometimes feel like it is misleading as I've still work to do and being told to stay at home makes me feel like I should be relaxing by not doing work. I am anxious about my financial situation and confused about what I should do to make it better as I am not usually in full time employment but rather find jobs to do alongside my studies to support myself, so as much as I'm aware there is no support for people like me. I am fighting with myself to be motivated and have some semblance of a routine without having anywhere to be at any time.
