At the moment i feel like i don't have enough information, as i need to know how to deal with the situation. There is a lock down in place, and procedures underway, however this could take a while to resolve.
As the problem is a biological and environmental one, it seems difficult to avoid and overcome.
However, i am thankful for the efforts of world governments for keeping us informed, or at least warning people to stay away and self isolate, even if this is difficult.
That said, i still feel as though i need more information about what the virus/infection is and how to deal with it's effects so as to avoid becoming ill.
