I understand the need to self isolate to protect ourselves and others but I feel sad that I can't see my friends and family.
I am living with my partner but I feel lonely.
I am classed as vulnerable so I can't go to the supermarket and it feels like life is on pause.
I am lucky that I can work from home, I have a house and I am not on my own but the uncertainty is worrying.
I'm scared that someone I love will catch Covid 19.
I have anxiety about when lockdown will end and how it will end - if life will be the same or not.
I worry about lockdown ending too soon and a second outbreak happening - but how do we know when the right time will be?
