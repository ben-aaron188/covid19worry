Life would be simpler without this. Life would also be simpler if we had a Government who were even borderline competent! I'm very concerned about the health of my elderly relatives (my mother-in-law is currently in hospital with CV, and my mother -- who is in a nursing home -- is showing symptoms which may be it). I'm also annoyed that the virus has taken away many enjoyable things -- like the celebratory dinner party I was supposed to be holding last weekend, and the holiday I was due to leave for tomorrow.
