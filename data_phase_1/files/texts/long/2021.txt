i feel mostly frustrated not knowing how much longer there is to wait until we are able to go outside, see friends and attend gigs and festivals. i feel lost and more alone than i usually do. i feel confused because i do not know how worried i should be about the virus itself. i am concerned about my own wellbeing and mental health. i feel relaxed because my daily life which i was already feeling aimless in, has stopped and i can enjoy time at home without the weight of pressure i usually feel. i am also slightly excited about experiencing what will be a massive historical event to talk about in the future (i'm a history student i'm not crazy).
