Feeling trapped within the house, anxious and irritable. Fear fueled by the news. No end in sight. Conflicting information form the government and a constant list of government advisors in the media. Feel like health is suffering, can't get teeth checked. For situation means not able to shop for the healthiest diet. Exercise is severely limited. House is dark and am desperate for fresh air. Not able to see my family or friends. The children are struggling not been able to see their friends. Money worries and the future is not available to view.
