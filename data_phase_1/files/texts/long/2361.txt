I feel anxious at the moment - this anxiety is coming from a place of fear and uncertainty. I am fearful that people I know will get the virus and becone ill. I am uncertain as to how long the lockdown situation will continue for, and the longer term effects on the economy etc. I feel helpless as thete is little I can do to affect positive change. I also feel sadness when I consider the sheer number of deaths. I think we all just want to go back to normal now, we just don't know what the future holds. I think I am getting increasingly frustrated with people who are not following the rules of lockdown and social distancing and isolation- they are causing deaths every day. I think there is now a distrust of others because of this - this virus has bought out the worst in people.
