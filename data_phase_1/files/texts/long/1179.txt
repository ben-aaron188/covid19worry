I am a little concerned that so many people are not staying at home and risking themselves and others just to enjoy the sunshine. I think the situation will get worse of the next few weeks but, hopefully, will then start to slowly improve. I'm worried what state the country will be left in as so many businesses will close down and the way we live in this country will be changed forever. So many small businesses and self-employed workers will struggle to survive. I am hopeful that a vaccine will be developed before the end of the year.
