I am very worried about this corona situation. I have only been to the shop twice and I was so anxietyâ€™s and scared each time. I was scared about whether I would get it and also scared about what ppl would think about me being out and about. People who are not following guidelines are making me angry. They are the ones who are spreading these germs around and making this situation a lot worse. Lockdown is also going to be implementing more stricter guidelines. I am upset also that I have not been able to see my family. The are on isolation and I have had to drop them shopping off in the garden by doing this this made ya all very upset.  I just want this to be over now
