I feel sadness at those who have been effected by the virus. I feel anxious about my loved ones and myself contracting the virus. I feel anger that people are not taking the suitation seriously enough. I feel we all need to be actively playing our part in helping the NHS and communities to fight this virus. It is worrying how the country is going to recover and when we will be able to go back to our day to day business. If anything good can come out of the situation, it is that the planet and environment has less pollution and people are being less wasteful
