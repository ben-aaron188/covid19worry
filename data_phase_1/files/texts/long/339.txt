I feel relaxed as I have the time to do things that I wouldn't normally do, such as reading books and learning new skills. However, I feel sad as I miss my friends and am worried about how long it will be before I see them again, hoping things feel a bit more normal in the coming months. I am generally a happy person and know that I need routine and my mind needs to be kept busy so I am trying to do that as much as possible. I do feel slightly anxious about the uncertainty of what the next few months will bring, but am optimistic that things will be better soon.
