its a scary situation to be in, we've never had a lockdown like this before and no one knows how long it is gonna last, which causes me anxiety. I hope things will go back to normal soon. It makes me fearful that i could catch it and be seriously ill or worse. I wish it would go away and things would get back to normal. there is alot of different information online and it is hard to know what is real, like how many people have it and die from it. Especially now that the prime minister boris johnson has it and has been hospitalized proves it can get to anyone
