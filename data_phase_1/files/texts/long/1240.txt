its such a sad thing to happen and lots of people are going through such hard times now with money , job and also not being able to go out and enjoy the outdoors like they did. the elderly are at risk which is also very sad to see , people panic buying meaning things are limited which is also hard . the NHS are doing an amazing job but people are still worried about everything getting worse .
I feel pretty worried about money and food at the moment. things are stressful I hope corna get less and less and they find a type flue jab to give in the future so less people are at risk .
