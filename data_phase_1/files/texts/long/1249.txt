I feel angry and disgusting at how people are behaving e.g. still going out in groups, masses of people sunbathing in parks, coughing in other peoples faces if they are not getting what they want (such as at pharmacists). I feel frustrated with the government as they are not being explicit about all the guidelines they are making. I am also annoyed at the fact they are voicing how important social distancing is but have not stopped public transport or shut down certain businesses that do not need to be open. I feel anxious as I am still having to go to work, being a frontline member of staff, and worried that I will become ill or pass on to others. I feel low as there is no real enjoyment at the moment and am missing my family and friends.
