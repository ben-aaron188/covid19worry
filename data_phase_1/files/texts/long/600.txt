It makes me scared to leave my house. I miss my old life. I miss seeing my parents and in laws, but I don’t want to pass anything on to them. I am spending less money as I’m not in and out of shops. I am a lot less stressed as I’m not jazzing around the place as I can’t leave home. It is a very scary time.
I miss going to my slimming world group on a Saturday morning.
I am sleeping a bit better.
I couldn’t see my mum on Mother’s Day for the first time in my life which was awful. I am eating more junk food.
