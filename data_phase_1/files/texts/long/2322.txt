It is very difficult as no one knows what going on. Where I have no more university it is sad. But I have found some peace in freedom and time to do what otherwise I may not be able to. I am somewhat anxious but happy. I have lots of time to speak to friends and family. I have found lots of extra things to do to build my own skills including painting. I am not angry, sad, disgusted or majorly fearful. I am doing okay and so is my family. Coronavirus is a deadly virus but we will make it through and the country will succeed alongside our amazing people working for the national health service.
