Im feeling ver very bored and anxious about this virus and its messing up my mental health a lot. This virus is making me not enjoy the things i do on a daily basis and its also very tiring even tho i am not doing anything and just sitting down. Also i miss interacting with people n the out side and just going out for some fresh air. I am unable to go for walks outside as i have a very low immune system and i am scared of catching an infection so for this reason i acoid outside and tend to stay in.
