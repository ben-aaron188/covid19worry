The Coronavirus situation hasn't adversely affected my immediate family's financial situation because myself and my husband are public sector workers. If anything we're better off because we're working from home (i.e. saving money on transport) and not paying nursery/childcare fees.

Nobody I know has been seriously ill with the disease although I am concerned for my husband and mother-in-law who have underlying health issues. I am less worried than I was however because they are social distancing, and the people I know who've had it have gotten over it fairly easily. 

We were due to go on holiday to California at the weekend and this has obviously been cancelled, which is frustrating. We don't know when we'll get another chance to go away. We should be getting full refunds for everything though (apart from the money spent on holiday clothes, etc). 

I am worried for the frontline NHS staff and for other key workers, and concerned about the economic situation. 

It is difficult being stuck inside the house with a baby and a 3-year old but as our circumstances are better than others' I don't feel I can complain.
