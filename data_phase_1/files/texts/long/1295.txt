I dont feel concerned for my physical health, but the circumstances have made me lose my job and freedom therefor affecting my mental health and financial state which is worrying. I find myself watching the news daily, checking for updates. But I think it's mainly me being selfish and wanting my freedom back. As a sufferer of many mental health conditions being able to go outdoors and get out of the house is good for me. Being able to pop down to my friends house and see how theyre doing, going to the pub for food and drinks. Just normal activities I'd like back. The aspect of the virus itself doesnt scare me unfortuntely, but I am following the rules of self isolation like the law is currently stating. Just wish it was over so I could get back into work and a good head frame.
