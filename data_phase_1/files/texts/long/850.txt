I feel very anxious about the global coronavirus situation both from a population level and on an individual level. I have previously been hospitalised in ICU when I was 18 with pneumonia so whilst I feel very concerned about the health implications for myself I also feel a very strong empathy and sympathy for all of the individuals suffering with coronavirus, and the families which are being affected by it. I believe this anxiety is made worse by the constant media attention, although I do understand why this is necessary given the severity of the situation.
