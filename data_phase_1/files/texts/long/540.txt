the first week I struggled adjusting to 'the new normal' and was very bored and irritable but now I feel I have adjusted well and feel normal most days, still bored a lot though. I do find the days go quick and im not as worried as I thought id be about the whole Corona situation. I'm slightly worried about my wage being different every month for the foreseeable future though. I just hope this virus goes as quickly if not quicker than it took to arrive in the first place.

There is an eerie feeling when you go out for your daily allowed exercise; i.e. there are very few cars and people about and everywhere is closed makes every day feel like a Christmas Day sort of feel, or that funny week inbetween Christmas and New Year where you're not certain of what day it is.
