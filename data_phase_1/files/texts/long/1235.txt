In some respects the isolation is not much different to me, being quite lonewolf and isolating myself usually anyway. However, I do fear for family members who are older, and I am totally disgusted and annoyed by how stupid the british public is in genral, by continuing to go against lockdown rules. It is also quite stressful when going sopping, because I do fear catching something dangerous, and also a lot of foods I ate on a regular basis being a healthy person at the best of times, are out of stock.
