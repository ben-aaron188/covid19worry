I’m really afraid that I might catch the virus and something bad will happen to me. I am still having to go to work, commuting daily (five miles on foot each way.) I don’t think I’m essential to keep the country going, I just feel like the place that I work for is trying to squeeze every penny they can out of the clients we have before the government finally steps in and says we shouldn’t be leaving the house at all... I want a full lockdown and to be safe! It’s the only way to get rid of this virus and I feel like we aren’t doing enough to limit our interactions outside of the home.
