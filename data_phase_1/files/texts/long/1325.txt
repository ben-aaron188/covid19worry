I feel that more can be done  - the government seems to have conflicting stories of what is best in this situation (testing, supplying PPE to NHS, herd immunity, staying home.  I feel the public is trying their best to do what they are told and most people I know are afraid to break any rules of going out, while the police seem to highlight that they are following people and fining them.   People can only look after themselves and hope for the best  but it is very clear that people are not valued above money in government eyes.  the rich and famous seem to have an overwhelming need to boast or be relevant on social media as if it is their oxygen supply and they cannot live without adoration.
