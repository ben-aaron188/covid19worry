I'm nervous, anxious and sad about the current situation. I'm living alone and finding it difficult to concentrate on anything. 
I'm worried about the virus and how it could affect me and my family.
I'm now suffering from Shingles which the Dr believes has been brought on by stress. 
I feel vulnerable, afraid of going outdoors in case I contract the virus. 
A friend of mine is currently on a ventilator and sedated, that scares me as she is younger than me and that brought it home to me just how dangerous this is.
