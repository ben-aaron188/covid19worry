I currently have very mixed emotions regarding the coronavirus. I am sad that I am unable to see my parents as they do not live in the same house as me and I am worried about their health and them being safe. 
Although it has not been by choice it is almost nice to pause and have a break from every day life although it is now starting to become a struggle and I am missing the simple day to day things I would normally have the freedom to do. 
I am disappointed in some people who are ignoring the rules and not listening when there are people dying from this awful virus every day.
