I feel anxious mostly. Around the safety of my family/partner, but also around my own health. The thought of getting a severe respiratory illness is terrifying, even if it is unlikely that I'll become severely unwell, it is more possible now than it has every been. Time at home, reading news reports only compounds this. There is also an element of boredom and loneliness associated with isolation, not being able to see friends. Having very little to do and not being able to do the things that I want to be able to do.
