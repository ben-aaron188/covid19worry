I feel that we in the UK have not hit a crisis situation yet, despite the number of cases and deaths we have incurred. There is definitely a strain on society, the government and the health service but it feels (just barely) manageable if it continues at its current state. Now we are weeks into distancing and isolation and the rest of the globe it has become easier to accept. I am young and healthy and so have no personal concerns about my own health in this crisis. I have not yet had any close friends/family suffer from the virus so I remain relaxed for now. I have no dependents and am not out of a job. I have faced far fewer negative consequences from the current situation than other citizens across the globe.
