I'm feeling quite scared and stressed about the pandemic at the minute, but more anger than anything. The UK government has handled this miserably, and I think that's summed up best by the fact that many leading figures in government have caught the virus. As someone who is at very high risk due to being on multiple high dose medications for asthma (and also smokes, although I have cut down greatly during lockdown due to fear for my health) there is a very high chance that I will get the virus seriously, if i do contract it. I haven't left the house since 15th march and it's boring but I'm very happy with staying in if it means I am safe. my biggest concern is that the government will ease restrictions too early - in order to try and save the dying economy they could put us all at risk of an even deadlier second wave. I am in my early 20s and I haven't received a letter about my vulnerable status from the NHS, which is absurd since despite my age I am very at risk and the asmtha uk guidelines say i should be included with the shielding group. I think the government has included the very bare minimum of people in the extremely vulnerable category in order to only just cover their backs. It makes me so angry that the NHS is unable to cope with the pandemic due to so much austerity and cuts from the tory government, yet people seem to think that Boris johnson is doing a really good job or that he is some sort of hero or martyr. It makes me sad to think of how different this situation would have been under a corbyn government. I can't pay rent due to losing my job which adds to another level of stress for me.
