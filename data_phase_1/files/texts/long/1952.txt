I am hopeful for the future and to return to work as normal. Also, I am excited to see my family and friends again, especially my elderly relatives who are in self isolation at the moment. However, I am worried about what will happen in the coming months regarding my families health. I am emotional about the deaths that have occurred already and am scared for the deaths that will come.  Also, I fear for the economical effects of this and how our daily lives may have changed forever, and the effects this will have for generations to come.
