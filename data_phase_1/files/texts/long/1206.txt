I feel mostly sad because everything i have looked forward to this year, my 21st birthday, my holiday, my graduation, seeing my grand parents, even my last exam its all been cancelled.
Along with that feeling comes anger however i do not blame anyone, maybe it's anger that i did not make the most of the time i had whilst i was with the people i have the most fun with at university and now it's over and i will never have that again 
I feel anxiety at the uncertainty around my degree, around where i'm going to live and around being able to get a job, as i've lost my part time job and do not have an income.
