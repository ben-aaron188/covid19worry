I am angry that the situation has worsened without being contained, I think the government acted too late.
I am sad that all of my Summer plans have been cancelled and that I can't travel abroad anymore.
I am worried about the health and wellbeing of the elder members of my family. 
I am appreciative of the NHS staff for putting their lives on the line to help others. 
I am anxious when I have to leave the house for essentials (like buying groceries)
I am enjoying spending extra time with my mother, father, and brothers since we are quarantined together but I am restless because I cannot see my friends and go outside as much as I would normally do.
