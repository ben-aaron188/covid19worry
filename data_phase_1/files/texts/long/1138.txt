anxious about the future and the outcome of all of this. No one knows exactly what is going to happen. This is effecting all types of buisnesses and people all over the world. Will it keep spreading and things go back to normal or will this have a long lasting effect on multiple things for a long time and generations to follow us will see the results of what happens in the next few months or years. i also feel we are recieved accurate effects or numbers to do with this viru. not sure how to trust realistically. how peple react now and in the long run is also quite concerning.
