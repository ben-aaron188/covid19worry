I feel extremely anxious at the moment about Coronavirus. My grandmother is mid 80s and although she hasn’t left the house in weeks I’m still concerned about her. My parents are in their 60s so are mid risk and my mum is still going to work. I don’t want them to get sick. I am missing seeing them and it’s making me sad. I’m anxious because I’ve lost a new job and so we have had to freeze our mortgage. This makes me nervous and I’m worried in a few months time there won’t be enough jobs for the unemployed like me.
