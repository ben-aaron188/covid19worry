I feel trapped in my own studio. I have absolutely nothing to do. I just keep watching Netflix and I hate myself for doing so. I have no motivation to do anything. I'm tired, anxious for not knowing how much longer I'll have to do this for, scared for my family and myself. I feel extremely lonely. Videocalls feel fake like I'm not really talking to my friends or family. I really hope the quarantine state ends soon. I feel unsure about the future. Every day feels exactly the same and I hate it. I think I'm becoming depressed.
