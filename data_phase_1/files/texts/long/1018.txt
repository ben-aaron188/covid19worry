I am worried about my family who are at risk and have had their lives impacted by the current lifestyle changes. I am also sad for my friends, most of whom in the music community have suddenly lost near 100% of their current and future income.
However, personally it has had almost no impact on my daily life which is fairly reclusive anyway. I am shopping less frequently and buying more than usual. I am also drinking at home rather than in a pub with friends (usually this would happen once or twice a week). I am keeping socially active via the internet and video calls. 
In one way it is nice to have a break from life! However I am anxious about the imminent financial stress when the world starts working again.
