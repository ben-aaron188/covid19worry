I feel shocked about the corona virus situation, at first not taking it seriously to now I cannot quite believe the impact it has had. Originally I believe it to not be that serious as it wasn’t impacting my age group but now I can see it impacts all and how many lives it has taken is disgusting. I also feel worried for all the elder members of my family who still have to leave the house, no clear lockdown has been provided so no one is obeying. Another fear is anger at the amount of people who are refusing to listen to the governments advice, not being able to see what has happened to other countries who haven’t taken their lockdown seriously. The fact that I can still see on the news people going to the park to sunbathe or meeting up with their mates when all this is happening and people are suffering makes me angry.
