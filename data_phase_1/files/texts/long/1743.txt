When the coronavirus was first heard of I was quite relaxed.I never thought it would turn into a pandemic.As more and more countries have infected cases it makes myself worry more.As each day goes by I find myself become more and more nervous and anxious about the situation.The lockdown has brought out sadness in the fact our way of life has changed for the time being.I try to think positive and abide by the rules of the lockdown and hope one day life will be back to,normal.THe more cases that are confirmed in my own city brings the virus even closer to home .
