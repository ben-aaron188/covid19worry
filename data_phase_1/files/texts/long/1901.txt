I’m feeling very restless with no energy to do anything but mentally feeling geared up to wanting to get back to normal and feeling trapped that I can’t. I’m upset that I can’t go to work, I feel very distant from everyone as I’m not so good at talking through text and phone calls, the way I’m better a socialising is to be around people face to face. I feel very anxious when I go to the shop. I’m worried about what the future holds and how long it will go on. I’m feeling very lonely not being able to see my boyfriend, this is causing tension and problems which is adding onto the anxiety. I’m worrying about my job and how busy they will be and how the people I help will be having a harder time to speak to someone.
