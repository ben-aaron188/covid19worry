I feel somewhat relaxed about the entire situation, now that the Government has began to increase the pro-activeness of Covid-19 prevention and testing.
However some anxiety remains, and is likely to continue until the entire situation is resolved. I feel that the primary source of fear/anxiety is due to the delay in Government action, along with individuals not following the 'lockdown' rules in place throughout the country.
Although from another perspective I'm slightly relaxed after adapting to a working from home lifestyle.
