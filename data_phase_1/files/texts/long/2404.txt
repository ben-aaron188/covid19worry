My anxiety levels have gone up as I fear for my elderly parents and young children.  I worry about the finanical fallout from all this as my partner is currently furlonged and bills still need to be paid.  i feel extreme;y stressed as I have to work from home using unknown technologies all while having to answer questions from the general public.  I feel aberhension at the thoughts of this continuing for a long time.  I worry about how this is going to effect my childrens educations especially my youngest as he was just about to sit exams to decide what secondary school he could attend
