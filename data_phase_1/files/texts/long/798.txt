It is certainly a national emergency, and I am quite worried about it. Luckily for me, there aren't many cases in my area, so I feel that I'm quite lucky. I'm quite sad not being at work though. I am very grateful for all the work the NHS does, and wish I could do more. However, I have asthma, so can't. I am hopeful that the number of new cases will start to drop soon. To be honest, the most prominent feeling for me is boredom; I am just sitting at home all the time, and relish any opportunity to go outside
