With all that is going on at the moment my anxiety levels are very high I really don't want to leave the house even for shopping
I fear what may happen next and to be honest feel quite scared a friend of mine who was a nurse has just died at the age of 29 she was trying to save lives and lost her own
I really don't know what will happen next I feel scared as the death toll Rises each day I worry for my family and friends
Is the scary time in the world with everybody on lockdown also not working at the moment so I have money worries as well it just had the stress s of being in the house
