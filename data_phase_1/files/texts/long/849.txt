Anxious as the future is unknown, fearful of the amount of deaths. Continuing to remain hopeful about my friends, family and loved ones remaining in good health. Worried about the financial impact on the economy and the NHS. Anxious on the impact this will have on people’s job security and young people’s education. Anxious about how long I can actual manage remaining in the house without much outside activity and interaction with other family and friends. Overall, it is a anxious time for everyone and the saddest thing about it all is that no one knows how long this will last for so at the moment everyone is battling the fear of the unknown.
