I am very anxious and apprehensive about the current Corona situation. I am angry about all the people choosing to blatantly ignore the lockdown and social distancing. I fear how many people will carry on getting infected by not adhering to the guidelines that have been set in place. At this point, I think the lockdown should be made stricter as some obviously are taking advantage of the hour of exercise outdoors each day. I fear for my own health as I am in the vulnerable category as I have DIabetes and take immunosuppressants.
