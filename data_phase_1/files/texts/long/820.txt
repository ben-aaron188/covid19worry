I'm not personally very worried about corona affecting me directly from a health stand point due to not being part of the high risk category and the preventive measures that i take.

There's a small amount of empathy towards those effected but it's no more so than with any other large scale crisis.

The situation has however caused significant amounts of frustration financially and socially which is taking a negative toll on my emotional state.

I just want the entire thing to be over and done with so we can go back to living normally.
