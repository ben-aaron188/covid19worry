On the positive side, the closure of my University has made passing my year a little easier. That is the only good thing to come of this. 

And on the negative side, I am unable to receive any financial aid due to being a student. I would normally be working part-time along with my studies, however I am currently unable to do so as my place of work is closed, putting a pretty hefty strain on my finances. I'm also extremely anxious about going out, even though it's still very necessary for getting essentials. 

Finally, the uncertainty as to when it will all be over is rather concerning. I understand that it's impossible for any government to provide a solid date, but when you're told 3 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, it starts to take a toll on your mental wellbeing.
