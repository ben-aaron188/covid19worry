I feel anxious about the situation sometimes - numbers are still rising, university is still closed, can't see family and friends, and there's an uncertainty about the whole situation. I think that's the worst part - not knowing when things can go back to normal. I'm also starting to feel restless - I miss being able to spend time with my friends and I do feel more and more tired of being at home. But we all have to try and continue as best we can in the circumstances, and I realise that I am a lot luckier than some given that I live with my immediate family and we are all in good health.
