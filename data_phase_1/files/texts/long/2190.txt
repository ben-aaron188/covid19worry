I am deeply concerned about the corona situation.  The daily death figures are very grim and worsening by the day. Watching the news of other countries such as Italy, struggling with the daily death toll is quite terrifying.  Knowing that the government have no real idea when the pandemic may be under control is both a great personal and financial worry. Having heard the news that the Prime Minister has been admitted to intensive care today shows that none of us are immune to catching Covid-19.
