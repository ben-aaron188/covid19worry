It still feels like the calm before the storm, the numbers are growing so fast now everyday. Watching the news gives me anxiety and all I can think about is how many of my loved ones are likely to be affected. It’s heartbreaking to see people still going out unnecessarily when others are trying their best to follow all the guidelines and stay home. All I want to do is see loved ones but that’s not possible, whilst many people just aren’t listening and are taking advantage of the situation. It brings anxiety just to think about the situation but hopefully if we keep safe and follow the rules everybody will get through this
