Feeling anxious not knowing how long it will be before things go back to normal. Impatient and thinking a lot about all the things I'm missing. Feeling trapped in my environment and need of respite. I am understanding of the why but also a little annoyed at the slight ambiguity of instructions. As someone who feels they must stay at home at all costs I expect the same should apply to everyone. Those who are disobeying or taking advantage of loopholes should be punished and privileges taken away.
