Sometimes I feel hopeful about the situation: I believe that at some point life will back to normal, that we will have a vaccine or cure to the virus, and that people stop becoming sick or died. 

But, when I read the news, or friends share with me information about coronavirus in the UK or in my origin country, I get anxiety. It is hard being away from my home, family and friends in a foreign country and seeing what it is happening in the world. 

At the same time, I have asthma and my husband has to keep working, so at some moments of the day, I feel afraid and nervous. Sometimes I also frustrated, because I don't know what to expect about the future.
