I am mostly feeling ok. I'm coping well with isolation as I've had to work in very isolated places for reasonably long periods of time before and at least I'm in my own house. There's just an undercurrent of anxiety that kicks up every now and again. I'm worried about vulnerable family members, though not as worried as I was a couple of weeks ago. I'm finding it difficult to focus on my research, but I was never great at working from home. I was definitely more anxious right before lockdown but I think now I'm in a routine and not having to watch other people behave irresponsibly I'm less stressed.
