I feel we are in uncertainty circumstances and I feel anxiety. It change my daily routine and daily lifestyle because I have to stay at home. I work from home and does no need to commute to work during weekdays. This means I am more relax and feel more pleasant. I can enjoy more time at home and with the family.  The weather is not too nice and warm.

My only outdoor activities is the 1 hour to jog in the park as permitted by the government.

That said, for the long term we shall prevail and defeat this virus once and for all. It will take some time and effort
