This is a truly awful situation that a great deal of people going out in going out normally/ sunbathing in parks/ BBQ on the beach are not comprehending.This virus is lethal & does not show itself.Understandably people do not like staying at home.But we must do what we are told otherwise thousands of people will carrying on dying. I am in isolation (NHS advised) scared,frightened but safe not vulnerable.We must comprehend that we are in this for the long haul,patience & tolerance should be observed.
