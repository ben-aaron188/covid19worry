As an Nhs worker I'm extremely anxious to go into work. No idea what I'm going to face and no idea what I'm going to come home with to my family and 3 children. I am scared and worried constantly for my families financial future. Everything is so up in the air at the moment. Everything is a worry . I wonder what the future will be like when all of this is over. Will it be the same. How different will things be. I worry for the safety of my husbands job he cannot ve furlough as he started a new job.on 9th march. He has been constantly employed for 25 Years. This is a big strain on us financially  how will this effect my children in the future?when will they go back to school?
