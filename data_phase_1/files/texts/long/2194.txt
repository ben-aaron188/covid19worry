At this moment, I feel quite lost and helpless. It feels like we're all trapped in a state of constant despondence - a feeling I cannot handle right now. It's late on a Monday night, and I have no idea of what to fill my time with.

Knowing that people are losing their lives to the extent we have to shut the entire planet down to prevent the apocalypse is absolutely terrifying. We could literally be on the brink of collapse, yet you have people going shopping 3-4 times a week as an excuse to carry on as normal.

The fact that so many people are so selfish - to the point of risking lives - is turning that fear and anxiety into a deeper sensation of anger. I wish I could pass a law censuring the people who keep talking about others going on picnics while they wander around shopping centres, as if there's a difference in risk nexus.
