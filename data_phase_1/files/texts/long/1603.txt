I feel very confused about coronavirus. Living in a time where I feel I know as much as the government is very serious. I feel I have learnt the boundaries of trust. Without devoting my trust to various people, I feel it would encourage negating thoughts and anxiety. However being kept in the dark and relying on trust can be as equally testing. On a more localised level I feel content that I should be ok, based on the main risk factors I don't fall under. I have more feelings of concerns for others close to me who do fall under the risk categories, such as grant parents.
