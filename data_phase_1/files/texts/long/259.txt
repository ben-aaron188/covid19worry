I'm concerned and anxious about what may happen to certain family members if they were to be infected. I'm angry at the people who are spreading false information and conspiracy theories, angry at the people who aren't listening to social distancing requests and think it doesn't apply to them. If I'm giving up seeing my friends and family for weeks/months, how bloody dare they think it's acceptable to be having family parties? I'm worried about how we come out of this. What will be the effect on the economy? Jobs? The mental health of our children/adults? I'm stressed because I can't get a shopping delivery slot and don't want to have to risk myself or my husband going to a shop
