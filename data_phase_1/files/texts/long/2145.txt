I feel let down by the government, I have lost all my income and because I didn't make enough to pay tax I won't get getting help, I understand the lock down and I think it's definitely reasonable but why are people who are on low income self employed forgotten when everyone else gets handouts. I'm trying my best but at this point I may starve to death, which shouldn't make me happy but happy but there is something sobering about the whole situation. As for the virus killing people, I know no one who has died or has contracted it, I don't care about celebrities and I think on the whole it will make the world a better place.
