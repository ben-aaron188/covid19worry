People are just stupid. If they followed rules, this could be better. It needs to be sorted and people do not help.
I'm worried about it because there's nothing I can really do, besides not going out and seeing people. 
I do worry about the economy and how it is going to recover. I don't get it but I hope it recovers. 
I just want to go on holiday but there is obviously more important things that need to be sorted. 
I hope it gets sorted but I don't understand how it is going to end? There is much worse to come and I do worry for the NHS. I work for the NHS but not proper front line
