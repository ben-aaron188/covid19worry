Its so horrible that people are not taking it serious when all they need to do is stay at home and know the fact that they will not be negativity affecting anyone, also the goverment should become more strict on the 4th of april london parks where full of people socializing and its just outrageous how you can be so selfish, its also so scary because its not just our country but so many others who maybe dont have the same kind of help pavabile

The only slightly good thing i can take away from this is that everyone in the world will be much better prepared perhaps for something like this if it was to ever happen again you cannot expect anything like this to happen in the world
