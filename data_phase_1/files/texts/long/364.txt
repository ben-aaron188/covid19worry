I personally feel that corona situation has kept be bored and depressed as there is now nothing to enjoy other than binge watching tv shows/movies and play games. my day to day life has now become repetitive and exchausting.  
furthermore i feel as though the precautions that have been taken to prevent the spread of the virus are a bit extreme, needless to save necessary but the way they have implemented them has seemed to be excessive to the point where i feel like my freedom has been natched away.
