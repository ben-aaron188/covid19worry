Corona is worrying for everyone, especially as the future of our families, the economy and the world is unknown. Although there is a risk of dying from corona the survival rate is so much higher and thats the part we need to focus on. As for me personally, although i'm worried about my family and friends i'm finding the lockdown situation actually quite relaxing and calming. Although not being able to do day to day things is frustrating at times, it's really given me the time to slow down and focus on myself and my wellbeing.
