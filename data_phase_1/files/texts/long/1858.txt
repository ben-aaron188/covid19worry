I am far less anxious about myself, and more so about my loved ones. My parents in particular worry me, and as Iâ€™m not with them that is the primary source of my anxiety. I think that the UK wasted valuable time that they could have used gathering supplies and tests and should have locked down earlier. Instead they seem to have fallen for their own exceptionalism and that is clearly proving false now, so I have anger about how this situation was handled and deeply hope we massively increase our testing soon.
