Happy to be at home with my family. Grateful for our living situation and the good weather. Not worried about the situation. Bit anxious about how much money I have left in my bank account though. Enjoying the sunshine and the easter holidays and not having to do home learning . Glad to speak to my mum this morning and that she is doing well in isolation. Glad that no one I know has been seriously affected. Glad to live near the beach and be able to go there each day. bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
