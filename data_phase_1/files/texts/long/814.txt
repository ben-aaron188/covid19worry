I think people are incredibly selfish. I am a Police Officer and have to go to work. People need to stay home and stop socialising and stick to the isolation rules aet by the Government so that people can see their family members sooner rather than next year! If people don't listen the government will have to impose stricter restrictions. I feel let down by neighbours who will not stay inside. I get people need to exercise for mental health but there is a limit. The amount of people I have seen out and about is disgusting. There is more cars driving around everyday which just proves the issues.
