I feel quite anxious and unsure of myself during this whole situation. As a university student I feel the government hasnâ€™t done enough to put measures in place to help us finish our courses so many of us are unsure as to what is going to happen. I also feel that not everybody understands how serious this situation is despite schools being closed and only essential services being open and continuing to run. It makes me angry that people are risking the lives of vulnerable and elderly people just so they can try and continue their lives as normal, which makes the quarantining that everybody else is doing obsolete.
