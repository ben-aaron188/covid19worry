Mostly anxious for my own job security, but also for the economic impact of the current situation on my householf finances and income, but also for the UK/World. I am also worried for the health of my family, especially those who are considered high risk. I also lack planning for the future due to the uncertainty of how long restrictions could last. I am also anxious about being in public due to the increased risk of catching the illness from other people. But I am thankful that I am healthy and getting an opportunity to spend increased time at home.
