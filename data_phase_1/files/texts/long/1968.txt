I feel really anxious as I'm out of work, unable to see friends, and have had family loss due to COVID-19 already. I also just feel angry, as people aren't taking it as seriously as they should be - seeing people out sunbathing and going for picnics is blatantly wrong, we have a lockdown for a reason and it angers me people won't listen. I want to return to work as soon as possible as the whole situation is just making me uneasy, and making my Mental Health worse. I'm not used to being inside all day apart from going for food, I'm used to a 9-6 day, on my feet at work all day. So being at home for so long is making me sluggish.
