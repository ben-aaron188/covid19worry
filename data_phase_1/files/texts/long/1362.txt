My current feelings on the Corona sitiuation right now is mostly anxiety over catching it myself. I'm also unsure about the future as my workplace has closed. We don’t know how exactly we’ll be impacted or how bad things might get so i am also facing a lot of uncertainty.  
I am staying home as much as possible, even though I don’t feel sick. So there is also the fact of being lonely. keeping a 6 foot distance between myself and others when out is also a very strange new concept. I have been maintaining a routine as best as I can. Even though I am stuck at home. Trying to stick to my regular sleep patterns etc.
