The government should apply stricter lockdown measures in the UK, but also people should adhere to these rules and stay inside. This is not happening unfortunately, due to which the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths are increasing day by day. I am both shocked and angered by both peoples' and the government's behaviours towards this as the matter is not to be taken lightly. Other countries, which are not in the West, are perfectly adhering to their lockdown rules but the UK isn't. What type of 'Great Britain' do we live in? I can only hope that the situation gets better.
