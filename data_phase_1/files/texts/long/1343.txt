Like many people my feelings fluctuate regarding the present situation. From a personal point of view I am missing being able to visit family and friends and the normality of life. I am generally a positive person and try to make the best of a situation so in addition to working (I am a key worker) I am trying to use the time wisely, to take in the positives such as much clearer air from lack of pollution and a quieter world. I am fortunate in having a large garden (tiny house) to spend time in and value that enormously. Against that positivity, C 19 itself worries me enormously. From a personal health point I am quite vulnerable and news reports are terrifying. I am tremendously sad for those who have lost loved ones so far and fear for more tragedies. I am angry with the initial response from Gvmt, I feel that the threat of this illness was not taken account of sufficiently and quickly enough and the economy was prioritised. My hope is that the form of socialism the Tories have been forced to adopt will somehow be recognised as the only way a nation should continue but fear that in fact, a harsher austerity package than we have seen prior to C19 will be employed, and that will kill just as many poor, disabled and sick people as this virus. Overall right now, I feel sad for the world but hopeful that globally, nations could potentially use this experience as a healing one to mend fences with our neighbours and tackle the big issues together. I can hope at least.
