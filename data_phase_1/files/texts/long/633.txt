I feel sad that many people around the world are getting ill and losing lives due to the coronavirus covid 19. I hope people adhere to the rules and advices given by the NHS and prevent the further spread of the virus. However there are still some people who are not following the instructions hence people with weakened immune system may be affected as a result. 
I feel like some people donâ€™t understand that they may not be significantly affected by the virus but they can spread it to someone vulnerable.
