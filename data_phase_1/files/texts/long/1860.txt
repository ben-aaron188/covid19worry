I feel very angry at the situation and anxious that my family will be affected - especially my mother who falls into the high risk category. I feel disgusted at the Asian warm meat and wet markets, for their barbaric practices which allowed this virus and others before Corona to spread to humans. I also deplore the way they treat animals it is disgusting and beyond cruel. Ideally I would like to see these markets closed down. All precautions must be taken to avoid this happening again. The whole world must work together and put changes in place to make sure this never happens again
