I just feel like it is spreading way too fast, as I work in a supermarket, I have to walk past people in a daily basis despite lockdown. 

I would be much happier if more people followed the lockdown advice given by the government. I still keep seeing people sitting on their street drinking beer and not having a care in the world. 

People seem to go from being mildly ill one day to requiring hospital treatment the next day. 

I hope the vaccine for Cov is ready sooner than the predicted timeline of 18 months. Too many people have already died from it.
