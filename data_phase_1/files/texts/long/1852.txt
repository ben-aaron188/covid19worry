I feel very worried about the current crisis, especially as I have elderly and vulnerable relatives and friends in high risk categories. I’m worried sick about them, as well as my other family members. This worry is keeping me awake at night and causing me great anxiety at all times. I am also very sad that I can’t visit my relatives and help them at all during this time. I feel very restless and helpless as a result of all this. I am also finding being stuck at home all the time is putting a lot of stress on my relationship with my partner, which is leading to constant arguments that aren’t good for either of us.
