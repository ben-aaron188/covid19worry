i am both angry, and disgusted in the way this government has handled everything.
im very perplexed where the idea that herd immunity had any chance of working without a vaccine.
the current restrictions on movement put me on edge as i generally go for about 3 45-90 minute walks a day ( i have very restless legs) i absolutely am disgusted in the way the elderly have been acting during this whole thing. primarily their defiance of isolating themselves, and a significant amount of abuse towards service providers shops etc.
