I'm personally not affected by it right now. However, it's worrying how many people are being infected and killed by it. Being isolated socially is difficult at times. However, I am feeling good at the moment. I worked a lot on self-improvement today, I had time to read about interesting topics and meditate. I even managed to get out for a small walk, as I'm lucky that there is a path near my home where not a lot of people travel through. I just finished my tea and now I'm mostly watching videos online.
