Currently I feel less anxious about covid-19. It's the end of the day, I've taken time to pray and understand there are many things out of my control. I've also watched some shows and participated in other activities such as playing ny guitar which has cobtrumibured to my current mood (feeling relaxed).
When I consider the number of people that have died in such a short space of time due to the virus, I feel saddened and numb. I feel confused at how this virus is having such a massive impact on life as we know it. When I hear stories like the two French doctors discussing potentially trialing a vaccine in Africa, or individuals stealing food shopping from vulnerable wheelchair users, I feel angry and disgusted. That humans can consider and treat other humans with such little regard. However I also feel driven to play my part in this pandemic by staying home with the hope others are doing the same.
