I am afraid for my friends and family. My grandparents are elderly with health complications and live in Nashville, if they became ill we could not go to them. My exams have been majorly disrupted, there are no job openings I can apply for and my private landlord at uni is still making us pay full rent with utilities included although we have been sent home by the uni. I feel uncertain about the future and how life will adjust to a somewhat normality after this pandemic. I have bad anxiety which is being exacerbated by this situation.
