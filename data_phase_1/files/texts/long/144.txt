I feel exhausted and a bit fed up. I am a community carer so I am classed as a key Worker. When  I am getting up early for my shift, putting on a fake smile to appear chirpy to my clients and give a positive vibe, barely having time for a break, putting myself and my family at risk and generally wearing myself out; to then see lots of people ignoring the rules and going out just because it's sunny is both frustrating and exhausting. However, I live at home with my mother and boyfriend and although tensions have been high as I feel we are getting fed up and under each others feet sometimes, I do feel like we have grown closer and make more time for each other now
