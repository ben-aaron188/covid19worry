I think it escalated quickly so worse than anticipated. A lot of deaths which is very worrying. Angry for the people who aren't taking this seriously and not caring about the safety of others. But also feel a sense of hope that everything will be okay in a closer time if everyone decides to actually listen to the government and authorities. Even though this is escalating and worrying we have to find some positives, this can include having free time to learn new hobbies and do something you never originally had the time to do!
