I am very distressed, my mum is currently being assisted with her breathing in a London hospital because of this virus so I am sad, scared and not hopeful for a good outcome. I am very worried about sending my children to school as I am a key worker and concerned that I will not make it should I contract the virus as I have underlying health condition. This combined makes me very scared and anxious. I am fearful for our futures and how I will safely get food for my family without exposing myself to risk and potential transmission
