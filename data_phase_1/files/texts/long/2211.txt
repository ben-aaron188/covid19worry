I feel anxious about how it will go, but overall fairly calm that we are safe as we haven’t left the house. I’m also anxious for my colleagues and former colleagues who are on the front line. As somebody with a health condition I am very aware that I might not fare as well if I catch it, so we are being extra careful. I’m also frustrated with the government for dragging their feet on antibody testing. I also have a small child, so I’m tired through constantly having to entertain her and not having any of my usual outlets. I usually leave the house at least once a day, so having been in for three weeks at this point is giving me cabin fever.
