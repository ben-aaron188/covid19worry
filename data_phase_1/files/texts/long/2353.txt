It's worrying how things have escalated as much as it has. I keep up to date with the news and it does make me feel a bit anxious, but I think it's essential to know what's happening. I'm not a high risk person but my parents are, so keeping them safe is a priority. It's frustrating having to stay home but it's the only way to curb things while waiting for a vaccine to be developed. I never really left the house much before the lockdown anyway, although now it's enforced, I now have more of a desire to go out. I've been washing my hands a lot more frequently, and also started to use hand moisturiser to keep them from cracking.
