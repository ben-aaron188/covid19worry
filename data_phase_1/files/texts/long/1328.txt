It makes me feel ibcredibly ubcertain about the future, both job, health and relationship wise.

My job has been paying me 60% less for the coming months, I feel unsafe going outside and feel a little stuck inside.

Overall I am very anxious and afraid of what will happen as I have just read there are over a million cases worldwide now, with 69 thousand deaths.

The UK seems to be doing as much as they can, but I don't think this is enough, there should be a lockdown happening to keep this from spreading as soon aa possible.
