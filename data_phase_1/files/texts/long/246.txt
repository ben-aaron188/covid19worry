I am very worried for both my own health and that of family and friends.

I am concerned for my work colleagues who are even busier due to the crisis and feel guilty and depressed that I cannot help them as I am having to self isolate due to my own health conditions.

this is a strange situation, as I have no control over anything, and no cure or solution in sight, if the lockdown ends, I would still think that everyone would still be susceptible to the virus.

I want to do something to help, but feel inadequate that there is nothing that I can do apart from remain at home, unable to see my loved ones, and just listen to the news of the worldwide crisis.
