I'm not worried about contracting the virus but i am worried about passing it on to other people and vulnerable family members. I wish people would stay in there homes when they can and stop being selfish. I like the sense of community in these hard times like online pub quizzes and the hard work carried out by key workers. I miss seeing friends and going shopping whenever i want but i'm enjoying spending time with my family right now and i know everything will be okay again soon. I think the government were too slow to act on the pandemic but feel that they are now taking the right precautions.
