My main issue is due to the lockdown because I am not able to visit my family and friends, I am worried for my grandmother since I am not able to visit her.People also stockpiling food and supplies is a huge problem. Specifically for older people since many of them are not able to visit a number of different shops which I have to do. I am worried when I do go outside for exercise or to the shops because I try my utmost to comply with social distancing but other people do not seem to care for it.
