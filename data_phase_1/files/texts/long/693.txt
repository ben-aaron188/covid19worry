I feel very sad at the minute with so many lifes being lost all around the world.People are dying on there own,the nurses are putting there lifes at risk to save others.The worst thing is a small minority of people are not taking it seriously and still going out with friends.I feel a full lockdown would benefit everyone and help save lifes of drs, nurses etc.If that was to be done, then life would get to normal alot quicker...There,s so many vulnerable people out there, then you get the one,s who think its ok they wont get it, and its the poor innocent ones that will suffer
