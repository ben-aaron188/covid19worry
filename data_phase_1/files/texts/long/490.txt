I currently feel a bit bored, but am getting used to it. I am high risk with asthma so know that if i catch it i will have a hard time with it. So its for the better. I obviously want to go out and do but significantly cut it down, with me not attending university, going work or going to the shops regularly, so filling all of that time i know have is hard and tiredsome. I realised i am sleeping longer and much more tired than usual, but am relaxed throughout the day, with no anxiety as there is less work on my shoulders.
