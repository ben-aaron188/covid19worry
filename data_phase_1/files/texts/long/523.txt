I feel really fearful of Coronavirus I’m not going to lie at first when it came out in China wasn’t one of the people who took it serious as I guessed it didn’t really affect me. Now it seems to be getting closer and closer to home. I just can’t wait for it to be a distant memory. I especially send prayers to those on the front line such as the nhs workers.
Although I’m a key worker I wish I was able to work from home but u unfortunately it’s not a possibility for me, it worries me every day getting on the train being around people who are not taking the 2 metre protocol seriously. I worry about bringing the virus back home to my family, especially as I’ve recently found out my aunty has been diagnosed although she was self isolating ?
