I am concerned, somewhat selfishly, for my own health as I have had a cough now for two weeks and I'm terrified of it becoming worse or suddenly dying. I am also worried about my friends and family, who I am currently unable to see, and lonely. I'm also concerned about getting groceries, because I am unable to go out due to illness, but am not a ""priority customer"", so I'm finding it almost impossible to get a delivery. However, my only family nearby is completely isolated due to being on the list for an organ transplant, and so obviously can't help out. I feel upset, as though I've slipped through the cracks in the system. I'm angry at the morons who keep going out and ignoring social distancing, and people who don't seem to understand basic hygiene. I'm generally just scared for how long this will last and how many will die before we have a reliable course of treatment or vaccine.
