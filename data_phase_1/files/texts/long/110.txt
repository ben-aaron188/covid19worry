I feel scared about what is to come, and anxiety about whether I will lose people I care about to this and the impact it will have on our future lives. I am worried about my parents and my partner's parents who are elderly and have breathing problems. I know they would not survive this. I am worried about future employment situation and worried that there might be a depression. I do not feel confidence in our government's ability to manage this situation. I feel sad that my son can't see his grandparents and we are stuck inside and I can't take my toddler on the swings. As I type this I am tearing up about it.
