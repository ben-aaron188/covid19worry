i feel saddened at the loss of lives. and the fact people have passed away with no loved ones allowed to be with them, its awful seeing familys unable to go out together on fun days with their children and having to see their elderly relatives through windows, not being able to cuddle grandchildren newly born, 
i also apppreciate the fact that we are still able to buy groceries. and everyone is pitching in to help the homeless and getting food to the vunrable people, there has been a real sense of community feel and seeing people donate and help charities is really nice.
