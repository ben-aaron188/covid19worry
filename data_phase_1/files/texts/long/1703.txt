I am due to give birth in two months and am very scared that this means that I will no longer be allowed my partner and mum with me. I also worry about the lack of support when my baby is born, and even now as J go through my pregnancy. I am worried for my vulnerable and elderly friends and family and work is very stressful due to the situation. 
I am angry at people ignoring the stay at home orders and concerned that this this mean that this isolation will have to go on longer. 
I feel really sad for those who are financially affected by this pandemic.
