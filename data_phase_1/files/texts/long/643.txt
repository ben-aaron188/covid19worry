I am resolved to do what it takes to keep my family safe during this time.  I am trying hard to keep anxieties to a minimum so as not to pass them on to my teenage daughters.  I worry about the social effect this is going to have on all of us and how we will all deal with the situation when we are allowed to socialise again.  I am concerned about my parents who are both over 75 and am doing all I can to help them but this puts extra strain on myself as I am trying to work, run the house and make sure everybody is safe, healthy and happy.
