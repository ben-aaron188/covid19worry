I mainly think it's sad how people have lost loved ones and our lives have completely changed. However, I am making the best out of this quarantine and using it as time to be productive. I am worried about catching the virus as I live with a loved one who is in a high risk group, however I am taking social distancing seriously so hopefully we will be fine. I am holding on and riding this out, and really hope that everyone else takes this isolation seriously too so that we can get this over with ASAP.
