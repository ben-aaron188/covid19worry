Frustrated that so many plans have had to be cancelled. We were supposed to be travelling abroad (within Europe) several times during the next few months.The unknown of when the situation will end is worrying. Hopeful that it will start to get better. Some level of worry about getting the illness and our relatives getting it. Fear that my children will be ill. I range from being fairly relaxed as it is genuinely nice to have all the family at home to getting tense about when and how life will get back to normal. I worry that my mum will be due a significant birthday within the next month and will likely have to spend this time alone which will impact her mood greatly. I'm appreciative that the weather has meant that we have spent time in our garden and that we are lucky enough to have a nice place to live in. Money worries do rear their ugly head from time to time but for now we are surviving. Our youngest child is very very bored and it is getting harder to motivate her to do anything. I'm concerned about the impact on the children's socialising skills at the end of this too.
