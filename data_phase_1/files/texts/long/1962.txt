Feeling kind of down and just in limbo. We dont know when and how this ends, and we are all trapped in these conditions where our lives have because so small. And there is a lot of death and anger and its emotionally exhausting with no release valve on it. 

Yet at the same time it is quite serene and theres a lot of time to reflect. Theres niceness in how people are cominjng together, but for me it makes me weary because I feel no change coming from this and no responsibility taken by those in charge who could have doen so much more and even now look for ways to exploit and benefit.
