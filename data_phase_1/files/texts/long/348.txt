I'm worried. I'm in a vulnerable group, as is my mother, so it's a scary time. I'm a homebody so I don't struggle as much as some with the idea of staying at home, but not doing anything at all is a little much. I'm missing out on seeing Book of Mormon, something I've wanted to do for years, which is a little saddening. I'm most worried about what the country will look like when this is all over. I'm sure big chains will survive, but what about places like the local Korean restaurant that I love?
