I feel worried about my job, my children and my family’s health. I am concerned that this may go on for a long time and that the chance to buy a house will not be possible.
I don’t know anyone who has illness and I am concerned that my friends may catch it and be very poorly due to existing health issues. I am a single parent and if something happens to me the children would go to live with their father who is completely feckless. 
 I am enjoying having no deadlines and the freedom that that brings but I miss the structure of the day when I was working and the children were at school. 
I’m concerned that the children will fall behind in maths and English but I am enjoying doing things such as baking and gardening that we wouldn’t usually have time for.
