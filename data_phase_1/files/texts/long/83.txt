I feel worried about the current situation, particularly how it affects my family from whom I am separated at the moment. Due to my partner being high risk, it means that I am anxious about passing the virus on to her, and thus it means that I have to be very particular about where I go and what I do. I enjoy playing sport, and thus the current situation is tricky in the sense that all of my fixtures have been cancelled as well, which whilst not being high on the list of priorities, it helps with my mental wellbeing.
