I am concerned about how the UK government is dealing with things.  They do not inspire confidence. They have been slow to respond, have got things wrong, didn't take it seriously early enough, etc. I have no confidence in them.  I'm quite enjoying lockdown though as I have so much more time and have been able to jobs around the house and the garden which is nice. I feel more in control at home, but am concerned when I venture out because other people are more unpredicable and the government hasn't locked down enough so the disease is still spreading.
