In light of information I have come across, I feel that the media and politicians have together overplayed the threat and have set the country on a disastrous path which is going to need years of recovery to improve the state of the economy and people's welfare. The flu death figures by march 2018 stood at 10,000, over 55,000 people eventually died by the end of that winter. No measures were put in place then that were extreme enough to have long term repercussions on the economy and people's lives. The measures should not have been to improve a lockdown but to recommend those in the at risk age groups to stay home for an period of time.You cannot just shut down the country the way we have done. The whole situation has been handled very poorly.
