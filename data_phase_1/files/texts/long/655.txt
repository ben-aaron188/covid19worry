I am very concerned about it all to be honest.  am scare for my at risk loved ones, who are more likely to get it and suffer badly because of it. I am worried for myself, as i don't want to get ill either. I am scared about my work, and how it will affect the running of it going forward. I am scared about my place in the world. I am sad that i cannot see those who mean the most to me, and about all the plans that i have. Not only are they on hold, delayed or cancelled, but i a scared my motivation will never return.
