I feel anxious and sad for the loss people are suffering and the greater impact the virus will have once the curve is flattened; loss of human life, financial, mental effects etc.
I feel that the government should have offered clearer restrictions earlier and that the information being given should be backed by scientific resources. More effort should be made by social media websites to reduce the false news stories and reduce people's anxiety.
I feel annoyed that in my industry (academia) there have been a lot of short-sighted decisions being made that have affected people's livelihoods.
