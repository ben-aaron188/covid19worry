Currently I feel on edge as everything is very much unknown. I wish that there was a date where we know that this will all definitely be over by to give us something to hold on to, but I know that this is not possible. I fear for the children that I work with and I hope that both themselves and their families are safe. I am concerned of the impact on children's education where they are likely to be out of school for a prolonged period of time. I am worried that my father will catch the virus and as he has underlying health conditions, I pray that this would not be fatal. I am concerned for my own mental health as I am living on my own and am already finding this difficult - I wonder what my mental health will be like weeks down the line. I am thankful for everything that each and every key worker is doing and I am grateful that communities are pulling together to help one another in times of need.
