My feelings are extremely conflicting in this situation and I feel as if they are battling against each other. One the one hand I am devastated by the tragedy and have a lot of anxiety and fear surrounding it, but more fear for others than myself. On the other hand of this, I have a sense of relief that I have more time and mentally I feel a lot less pressure on myself to develop in terms of my career and social life - but I feel guilty for this as there is a much larger problem at hand here. 

I have a lot of anger towards the government in the UK and around the world concerning how they are handling the situation. I feel helpless that I cannot do anything about it in terms of how they handle things. I believe they have the power to save so many lives but haven't done all they can.
