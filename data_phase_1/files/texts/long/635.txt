I am worried about covid 19 and I fear for my family. I have done everything I can to make sure my family stay safe and hopefully we will get through this virus. We have followed the advice from the government and have stayed Inside. I also worry about the food situation with all the people panic buying. I am grateful for the NHS stay and key workers who will help us through this.  We watched the queen give her speech  last night which I feel would have given some co fort to the country. I have read up on this virus and tried to prepare myself incase I or any members of my family get it.
