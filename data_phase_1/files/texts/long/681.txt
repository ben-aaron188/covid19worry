I am fairly relaxed about the current pandemic situation as I am self-isolating and taking the necessary precautions as outlined by the Government. My only concern is for my elderly mother but she assures me that she is coping and has enough food for a few weeks. Another concern is people ignoring social distancing and spreading the virus. This may undo all the work that other people are doing. The actions of a few can undermine the efforts of the many. Those are my only concerns. There is nothing else that I have to say!
