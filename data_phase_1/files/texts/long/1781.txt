I am worried for the people on the frontline and sad for those who have died. I am slightly worried about getting it when I walk to the shops but I try not to think about it too much because otherwise you can become too worried and stressed just by watching the news and social media. All you see are the number of deaths and it can become quite depressing and stress-provoking when in reality there is nothing I can do but stay at home. So I am just enjoying my time at home as much as I can and looking after myself so I am fit and healthy all while  trying stay positive.
