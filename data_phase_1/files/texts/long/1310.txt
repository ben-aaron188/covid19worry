At current times, I feel that the coronavirus situation is becoming progressively worse, most of all, I fear for the people who are not taking the governments advice, from my window i can see a large public field and there is many people walking and sunbathing on it despite the current situation, this causes me much anger as these are the foolish people who are preventing the government's measures from being as effective as possible.

Furthermore, i feel that people need to start taking the coronavirus situation much more seriously, rather than treating it as a joke, i see people when am out laughing and making jokes whilst wearing their face masks, thisangers me greatly, not because i don't support the use of face masks but because it is a serious situation and they should just wear the masks rather than joking around with them.
