I feel really worried at the moment because nobody knows who’s going to get it and how severe it’s going to be in each insidividual. I also feel scared as nobody is aware of how to cure it or how to treat it and it is becoming a widespread issue all across the world and this is impacting not just me but everyone else about in the world and the country. I am happy that they are sorting out the test kits and that their soon will be a test kit out for people to see if their is a way of curing or seeing if you have had the virus which will be beneficially to a lot of people
