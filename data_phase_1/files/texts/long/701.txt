I’m not too worried or concerned about the corona virus for myself personally. I do worry about it when it comes to family members that are elderly or a bit more vulnerable. And am hoping that it won’t take too long before people listen, remain in their homes allowing the virus to die away or blow over so it can be dealt with and life can get back to normal as it was before. It does annoy me that people aren’t taking it too seriously and thinking that the current lockdown situation is an opportunity for them to just do as they like and roam the streets possibly passing germs and the virus itself off to others who will then come into contact and infect those in their household.
