I fear for me, my family and my elderly relatives that if one of us were to catch it, then there is a serious chance one of us could be seriously ill. I am worried about the economy after this is over and the effect on peopleâ€™s jobs. It is likely we will lose a lot of businesses. Whilst I am lucky my job is currently ok, it is always in the back of my mind that it may not be in the future. I am anxious about it and think about it most of the time. I think once this is all back to normal it will change most things about the way we shop, treat each other and prioritise things in life. I think it is likely to be another 6 months before things have settled.
