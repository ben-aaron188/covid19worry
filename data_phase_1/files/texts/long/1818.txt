im worried as to how we are going to come out of the lockdown and how things are going to return to normal. I am angry at china because it seems like they are the the direct cause of the virus, they informed countries to late which didnt give us and the nhs time to prepare. im angry at boris johnson because he ignored alot of advice and scientific data and allowed people from virus hotspots into the country. to allow further spread. donald trump seems to think the economy is more important than peoples lives. some people in my country are ignoring the lockdown advice and have been gathering in large crowds at my local park.
