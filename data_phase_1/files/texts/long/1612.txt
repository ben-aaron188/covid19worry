Right now I mostly feel pretty tired/lethargic, alongside a generally more relaxed mood. It's been a strange day - I've mostly been calm, have had some spells of happiness yet have also had a period of feeling sad about the current situation. I'm missing being able to go on really long walks, feel free to head into the city, and generally to be able to live more normally. That said, I'd far rather this than fall ill or contribute to anyone else's illness. I've found myself reading lots of news articles/listening to radio shows and podcasts through the days to make sure I'm staying on top of the latest happenings. The coronavirus really scares me; especially as an asthmatic. Yet I've not felt anxious today. Generally, I'm mostly fine by day. The anxiety can creep out in the night or my dreams though (yet not every night) and I'm still sleeping okay on the most part.
