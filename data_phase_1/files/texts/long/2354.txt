I feel stressed because I can't get the protection I need (PPE/sanitiser), angry because the government doesn't seem to care about making sure people can stay safe and afford to live and bitter because I'm now stuck in this country which we had plans to leave by October 2020. Also stressed and upset because I work monitoring a Covid-19 mailbox where I get to see all kinds of issues about self isolation vs getting paid, lack of help, vulnerable people who can't get confirmation that they can work from home and emails about a major pharmacy chain in my area refusing to deliver medications to vulnerable people. Upset, disillusioned but not surprised.
