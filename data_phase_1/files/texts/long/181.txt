I'm mostly worried about my 65 year old mum with asthma getting it, but I'm reassured by the low death percentage and the fact that we live in a more rural town. Also a bit bored of staying at home and not seeing friends, but i don't mind really, if it's for the good of everyone. I'm naturally more introverted anyway so it's not affecting me as much as it is other people. My gran is also very vulnerable but she lives in a rural area as well and seems to be okay staying at home for as long as she needs. I'm doing all of the outside work for my mum, like going shopping etc, which I won't miss when everything's back to normal. But other than a bit worried for my mum I'm doing okay.
