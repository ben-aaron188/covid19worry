I feel very worried about work and my financial situation amidst this crisis as I work on a 0 hour contract in hospitality. The government allowance won't be enough to cover my rent and bills as I was barely getting enough money for this anyway when I had 100% of my pay rather than 80%. I am also very stressed about the mental health impacts of being shut in all the time. I'm lucky to have a boyfriend and pets with me but still find myself going stir crazy. I am worried for my eldery grandad who still goes to the shop every day even though my mother brings him groceries.
