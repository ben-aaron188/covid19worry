I feel fed up and resigned to the current situation. I feel worried about elderly members of the family particularly my father who lives 300 miles away on his own. At least I am happy we are fit and healthy and able to go out for a walk.  I donâ€™t mind working from home too much although not ideal of course.  Being able to see and talk to colleagues helps things and makes it easier to do things. As long as the technology works! At least I am happy when I get things finished or sorted out. Not sure though how upbeat we will be the longer this goes on.
