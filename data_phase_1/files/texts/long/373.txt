I feel quite relaxed at the moment. I ""work"" in a pub but haven't been to work since Boris Johnson closed all pubs. For me, this time is used to reflect on my life right now. My partner however is still working so spending everyday by myself staring at the same four walls can get a bit too much but I know that they'll be home come 5pm. Some however won't see anyone during this time which is sad. I know that if my mum didn't go to my sisters house, she'd have probably gone crazy. I don't really feel scared for the situation because, yes more people are dying every day but I feel as though the government are doing more than enough, and the cherry on the cake was the queen's speech last night (Sunday 5th April). I think she reassured the public including myself.
