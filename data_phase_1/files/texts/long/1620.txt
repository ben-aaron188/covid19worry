Very anxious and apprehensive about the future there are so many things up in the air. I'm finding it difficult to concentrate and motivate myself whilst being this anxious. The worst thing is no one really does know how to solve the situation and it feels like nationally not everyone is pulling together. I'm also worried about my family and friends as no one is immune yet people seem to think they are. Tense, anxious and dazed. Doesn't help when you've said pretty much everything and getting pushed for 500 characters in a survey - so add irritable to that too! My fuse is definitely shorter at the moment
