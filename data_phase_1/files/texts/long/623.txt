I have not been tested but have had cv for last 10 days and been very unwell. I am worried that my lung function will never go back to normal but I guess also relieved that I seem to be getting better now. I think most of my family had milder symptoms than I did. The fevers were Terrible. I am hoping we can begin to release some of the measures in a few weeks but know that will depend on impact. A lot of negative a have happened but have dealt with those so far. Now I am worried to some extent about how we get back to more normal living and keep infection under control. Also I donâ€™t want to get reinfected so hope that immunity is actually a thing which applies for a period of time.
