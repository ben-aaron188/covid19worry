I have general anxiety about the situation and I find it very sad. My anxiety has gone down in the past week though as none of my family or friends have symptoms anymore and are taking it seriously and only going out rarely. The whole situation is very sad with a lot of people dying. I do feel positive and happy a lot of the time though as I believe that is the only way to get through this and I achieve this by doing things I enjoy, going outside once a day, and not reading the news as much as possible
