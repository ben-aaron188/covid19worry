There is nothing I can do (apart from follow advice) so I cannot control things are outwith my control so do not worry about this.
I am still optimistic.
I worry about the future regarding government controls on people;s freedom being in place after the lockdown . 
I wish I could do more (out and about).
I feel disappointed that the Government has not done more to pre-empt this crisis.  
I am worried about my mother who is in the high risk category.
I am OK working from home
I am disappointed with the media as they do not carry any more stories other than virus news.
