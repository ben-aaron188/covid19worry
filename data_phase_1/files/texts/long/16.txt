I feel that we have not done enough in the UK to prepare for this situation - the NHS deserves all the support they can get, and the fact that people are still not observing social distancing angers me. Sadly it seems that the Conservative government have underfunded the NHS for a decade now, and they paying for it with innocent lives. The nurse who died from the coronavirus recently is just one of the many deaths that will be brought upon by us by this virus, and I blame the government for this. I have nothing further to add at this moment in time.
