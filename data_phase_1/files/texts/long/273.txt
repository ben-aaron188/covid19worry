I am very worried about the health of my family and friends. I'm extremely anxious. I'm worried about my son not being at school and missing his friends. When he goes back it will be like him starting school all over again. I miss my family but I know that what we are doing is for the best.i can't wait for this to all be over. I'm very saddened by the amount of people who have died and been affected by this. 
The NHS have been absolutely amazing at this trying time. Also key workers. They are all risking their lives for us.
