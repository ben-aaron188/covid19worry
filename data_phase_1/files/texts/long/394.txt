There hasn't been much change in my life style. So all I can do is wash my hands and stay safe. I work at a super market. So I'm a bit anxious about being a carrier. I don't want to end up spreading it to my friends, family and other cuatomers. But it's either I work or I starve. So I have to be careful. I wash my hands more these days. And symptoms from things like the flu or hayfever scare me a bit more. I just assume I'm going to be okay. And I always have the nhs to fall back on if I start to show a lot of the symptoms. Food shortages don't seem to be a major worry for now, but I wonder about wether or not anything could happen within those industries or with trade coming in from other countries.
