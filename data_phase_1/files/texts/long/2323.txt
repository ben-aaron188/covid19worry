It worries me a lot, because my husband is a High Risk individual and I'm scared he will get sick and die. I feel angry at our Government, because they have been systematically underfunding and mismanaging the NHS for almost a decade and now, when we need it most, it can't support us at the capacity we need it to. I'm angry because people are being so very stupid and I just want everything to STOP. I don't mind being asked to isolate, that's not the problem, but others being stupid and ignoring the rules is just really crappy.
