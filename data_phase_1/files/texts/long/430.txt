I feel worried about the uncertainty of it all, as this is a new situation for all of us. I have recently stopped looking at all news coverage of the situation because it was panicking me. But since I have cut this out, I feel much calmer. There are also parts of me that feel positive, and hopeful that this situation will change humanity for the better. For example, our approach to daily life, how we treat the environment and how we treat animals. If some good to come out if it, then it wouldn't have all been for nothing.
