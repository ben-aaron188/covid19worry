At this moment in time i feel agitated about the way that people are addressing the instructions that the government are giving us to protect us. Also that one of the main people who was giving this advice are not following the rules and were caught out on a walk with their family at their second home. As far as concerns for my wellbeing, i have not been out much and have not needed too neither have the people who i am currently quarantined with. So at this moment in time i am calm and in the right mind.
