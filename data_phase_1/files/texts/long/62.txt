At the moment, I feel worried about how long this situation will last. How long can we stay in a state of panic. Annoyed with people clearing the shelves in the shops making it difficult for people to buy what they need. Feel sadness that I cannot see the people that I love. My mental state varies day to day.
I think the people that are not complying to the rules are the ones that will cause the issue to become bigger than what it needs to be. 
I think the government could have been quicker with actions as we could see this coming and we could of had minimal effect, if actions were done before we had a confirmed case.
