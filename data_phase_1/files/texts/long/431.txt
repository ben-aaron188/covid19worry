I am very fearful for family, friends and key workers; the media and news round it is constant. It is as if nothing else in the world is happening any more. I also have little faith that the government knows what it is doing. They claim that PPE is being delivered to all that need it yet from line NHS workers say that this is not true. The needs of care workers and transport workers are also being ignored. I get the impression that those trying to manage the situation at a national level don't really know what they are doing and this does not inspire confidence in them as leaders.
