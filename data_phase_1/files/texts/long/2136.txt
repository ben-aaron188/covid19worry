I feel pretty depressed and my mood is low due to having to spend so much time cooped up at home. 

However I also feel a desire to help and play my part, and a sort of 'Blitz Spirit' that this is something we must all face together and get through. I worry for those close to me who are vulnerable to the virus, but accept that there is very little I can do directly to help them.

I do feel a sense of anger and resentment at the irresponsibility of China, in so much as they create the perfect conditions for pathogens to transfer from animals to humans by eating bushmeat, and meat from unhygienic sources, and process and sell this meat in unsafe conditions such as wet markets. On top of this, the CCP have repeatedly and deliberately mislead the world and their own people about the number and rate of infections and deaths.
