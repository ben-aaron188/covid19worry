I feel distrust within the government in regards to the severity of the virus. I believe we will be in lockdown for a lot longer than originally estimated. I believe this is because if they were to reveal the true length of  lockdown there would be a lot more anger and lack of cooperation. 

Besides this I am bored beyond belief, I am unsure of when things will return to normal. I hope it is soon. But because of my distrust of the government i'm quite sure this lockdown will continue until at least late may - mid june.
