If people would follow the rules and not go out when they aren't supposed to, we'd be a lot better off. They're selfish and have blood on their hands. We are following the rules and it's disrespectful for others to act like the rules don't apply to them. Also, if the government had done the lockdown sooner, we wouldn't have as many cases/deaths. Because of this, I'm very anxious and scared. Everyone in our house is high risk and some people are not taking this seriously. 
I know we can only control our household but it's scary to think about coming in contact with one of the people who don't care about anything but themselves and what they want.
