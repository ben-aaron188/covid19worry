I think there is a massive over reaction. We have given up our freedoms that, when the virus has passed, we will have great difficulty getting back. All this based on a virus that should be compared to previous outbreaks of illness such as Spanish Flu and Asian flu. On both occasions that these occured the results will be far worse than the current virus. The link between the 3 is that no vaccine was available for the Spanish Flu and none, initially, for the Asian Flu. The comparison will therefore be perfectly valid. Just a mass over reaction.
