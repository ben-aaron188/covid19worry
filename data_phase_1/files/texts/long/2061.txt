I lost my Mum to multiple cancers at the end of August last year and I never thought I would be grateful to say that she wasn't here but with all of this going on it would have been such a worrying situation that she could have been made worse by this virus. If I get it I get it won't matter to me, although I had a virus starting in 2013 that gave me a cough for a year and I did survive it, so who knows. I am convinced that this virus was either deliberately released or unintentionally leaked from the Wuhan Disease Research Lab
