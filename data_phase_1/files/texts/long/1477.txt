I feel that the World as we know it is going to be a different place for a short time.  I feel that over a space of time it will just be as it was before the Global Pandemic..  People will forget about the Community effort, sacrifices by front line staff and the importance of identified key workers as life gets back to normal for the majority.  It will be like the collected sorrow when Diana died but long forgotten now except by a few.  It has been good to watch the mighty scrutinised by the Country and found wanting and to stand and clap for those previously ignored.
