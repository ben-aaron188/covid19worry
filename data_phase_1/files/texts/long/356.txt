I feel very worried and anxious seeing how high the death toll and the confirmed positive cases keep rising each day. Everything seems to dark and bleak right now. People are constantly dying and losing their loved ones. It seems like there's no hope out of this situation. All I can do is pray everyday that God has mercy on us all and turns His wrath away from us and helps us out of this situation. It makes me angry to see people disobeying the rules and advice set by the government and causing more damage to the country and putting a lot of strain on the NHS.
