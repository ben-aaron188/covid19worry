I feel quite anxious because after some conversations with various people in my life, we have come to realise that this won't only affect us in the present or within the next year, but there will most likely be a lot of generational trauma within the years to come. With regards to my current concerns, I am worried about how I'd pay rent due to only receiving 80% of my wages, how my family will cover their costs with some of them unable to work/receive money, the health of my family, the health of my family overseas where arguably the situation is a lot worse. I have felt some joy in that I can spend more time on hobbies, but this also makes me anxious because I now find myself less determined to complete my university work as the motivation has completely vanished.
