Anxious how long it will continue before it peaks and how many more people will suffer and die from it. As I’m following the self isolation rules myself not too concerned personally as I haven’t been in contact with anyone outside my household for nearly 3 weeks but conscious of social distancing to help my family and to stop them getting it. Keeping busy as I’m working from home but hoping I don’t get called into the warehouse as a last resort as I work for a large online pharmacy so are key workers.
