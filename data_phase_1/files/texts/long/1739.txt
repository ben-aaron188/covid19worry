I have an intense job which has become much easier by staying home (education). I sleep more, focus on myself but also realise that this is a privilege that not everyone can have. 

I also understand that education is impacted for students at the moment, especially for socially deprived students who don't have home help, monitoring or the equipment to do the work. So many students don't have laptops or basic computer skills to open an attachment on an email (these are secondary school students). 

I fear for people who don't follow the rules. I also fear for the late stage capitalist society that we live in that can not cope under this pandemic. The economy has already been heavily affected by Brexit and now coronavirus will decimate it. I also fear for the homeless and the most vulnerable. Some countries, like the USA, is not equipped with the right leadership to seriously deal with it either. 

There was an initial panic to buy goods and there still is when entering super markets.
