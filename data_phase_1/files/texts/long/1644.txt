I am worried for the implications this will have for us as a community and our families when it is over. I worry how long it will affect our lives for and how much it could possibly mutate and be a even bigger problem. I am thankful for my family Blaine able to keep safe at home despite being a key worker who is still open to infection. I do wonder why it took so long for our lockdown to happen and why more stringent measures havenâ€™t been taken to prevent it spreading further, although it would be difficult to do it is definitely what the country needs.
