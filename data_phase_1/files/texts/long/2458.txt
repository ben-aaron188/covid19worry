At the moment I'm rather calm, just trying not to think about it, but I'm also scared and anxious. No one knows how it will be like in couple of weeks, there is not much we can actually do, just hope we're gonna be fine and nothing will happen to us and our loved ones. Also we need to hope that other people will do their best to follow government's advice, but in that case we're literally hopeless. Some people don't realise it's serious and their behaviour is just selfish so normal people who want to follow government's advice need to take extra precocious to stay safe.
