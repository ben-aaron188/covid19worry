I’m scared how long this will go on and how it will effect the economy. We were due to move in to a new build on the Friday after lockdown and this has now been delayed for the foreseeable meaning we don’t have a house and don’t know if we will have jobs to buy it after this has gone. Our mortgage offer will expire and as we have both furloughed we may not receive another mortgage offer. This was supposed to be our family home. I’m also concerned about the spread of the virus and how this is possibly going to be contained in any way shape or form.
