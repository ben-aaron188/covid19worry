I feel that it's very concerning, especially now that even the prime minister is struggling. Though i'm sure in a year or two we'll have moved beyond then, the period prior to that is shaping up to be pretty hellish. It creates a feeling of anxiety and dread and of wondering when life will get back to something resembling normality. I'm worries a little for myself but mostly for elderly relatives and they would be less likely to get over this. Those in old peoples homes and the like are sitting ducks, and I feel like this is a terrible time for us all as a country and a world.
