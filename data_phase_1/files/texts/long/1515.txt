I feel mostly fine about it because I am not really at risk since I'm young, however I feel a bit worried about my brother who has a condition making him more vulnerable as well as my dad who is older. I feel relaxed because the whole situation has made everything else (university, work, etc) and the problems related to that go away and for now I can mostly just do whatever at home. I am for the most part not too worried about the corona situation as I know it will be over soon and there are not a lot of cases in my area. However I am annoyed that it has had such an impact on my day to day life, as supermarkets require lining up now to get inside and I am barely going outside these days due to social distancing.
