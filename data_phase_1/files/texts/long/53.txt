I am worried that it has not been taken seriously and may be too late. I am angry that people are still flouting the rules and are not being punished for being a detriment to their own health and that of others.
I'm nervous because I have to work in healthcare and am exposed to patients who may or may not have the virus day in day out without knowing what I could be bringing home to my parents who are at risk.
I think that the Government need to be harder. Yes, they may not want to tighten lockdown rules, but if people aren't listening to them - they must. It is for the benefit of the country.
And I hope that we learn from this, and should something like this happen again, we be far better prepared and take it seriously from day one.
