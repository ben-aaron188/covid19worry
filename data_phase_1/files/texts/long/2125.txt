After just seeing boris Johnson has been admitted to intensive care after being seen on tv 4 nights ago looking fine, it's scary how quickly this virus can develop very seriously. I am worried for my family, who are at risk. It's a very scary time for everyone, I hope everyone stays inside and follows the governments rules to try and get rid of it. I also feel very sad for all the people who have lost their lives around the world, makes me a bit angry too. I feel anxious when I leave the house to get food and guilty in case I bring anything back into the house to put my elderly family members at risk
