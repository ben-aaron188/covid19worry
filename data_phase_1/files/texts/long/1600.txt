I have just had a moment of sadness/anxiety at the thought that my daughter might get coronavirus and die. As for me, although I consider myself at higher risk I have a lot of control measures in place which should reduce the expectation of getting it so I am relatively relaxed. Having eaten lightly - I am trying to improve my weight/blood pressure - I am a little less relaxed than I might otherwise be - being hungry does put me slightly on the more irritable side. I am not particularly bothered by the various bits of news.
