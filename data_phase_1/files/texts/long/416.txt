At this moment I do not have much fear for myself as a healthy 22 year old. I do however have fear for my parents, both of which are high risk and could be seriously affected if given the virus. This gives me anxiety in going out as I cannot risk picking it up and bringing it home to them. I also feel both disgust and admiration for officials who are acting in this situation, given that we are having to improvise I am impressed by high ups and especially, as a third year uni student, admire educational staff for adapting quickly.
