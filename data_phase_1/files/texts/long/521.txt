I am anxious about the future. I feel there needs to a full lock down to make people take the threat seriously. I am angry at the people who are choosing not to social distance and sad about the people who have lost their lives, their friends and family and people of the NHS who are working through this.
I am trying to remain positive by focusing on how I can use my time now to focus on a better future by studying more. I am sad that I have friends who are suffering with mental health at this time.
