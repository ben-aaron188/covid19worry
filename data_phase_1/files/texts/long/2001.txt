I feel sorry that people are dying from this and are having anxieties caused by it however for myself I'm really enjoying it. Everywhere is much more peaceful, the air is less polluted, the night sky is brighter, there's no noise at night, no airplanes in the sky. It's very much idyllic to myself. I took a stroll through the park the other morning and it was deserted. I don't have to waste my existence in pointless shops. About the only annoying thing is not having a place to take the kids but they're young enough they don't really mind
