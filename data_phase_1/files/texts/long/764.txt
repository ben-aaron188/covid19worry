I am very worried about the future.I have 3 part timejobs but i'm not getting paid or furloughed from any of them at present I have diabetes so i'm classed as at risk..My daughter is stuck over 100miles away and a have lost a friend and relative in the past week . My brother lives in the USA where things are getting worse.The uncretainty is the worst part,nothing like this has happended before so no one knows what the future holds. Cant think of anything else to comment on at present, this is like doing an English assisgnment
