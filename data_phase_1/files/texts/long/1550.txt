I feel like my life has become very limited. Although I enjoy being a home I dislike not having a choice in the matter.
It has affected my mental health in a negative way and there is little I can do about it.

The worst part is the uncertainly surrounding the duration of the situation  and when it will end. All plans for life have had to be put on hold. In a way that takes some stress and expecation away but also removes any sense of achievement. I feel disconnected from the real world and anything around it.
