Although I have been affected by virus financially I am more concerned about elderly or vulnerable relatives.
I think by following the advice we can help to stop the spread but not sure how long that will take. My best guess would be end of April or early May that the virus will be under control enough for people to start returning to work.
I think if you are sensible and take precautions you should now be able to avoid contracting it. Regular hand washing and avoiding contact with anyone outside of your own household should be enough to stop you from getting it.
