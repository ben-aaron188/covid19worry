I'm not so much scared for my own health but my parents. They're in multiple risk groups and I'm terrified that if they catch it they'll die. My mother particularly has a violent cough she's had for almost a year, but despite seeing her GP multiple times, it's undiagnosed and continues. If she catches Covid-19 on top on that, with her two other risk groups... I'm genuinely frightened she'll die. If the situation gets worse, she might not even get a ventilator if she needs one. (I have several very choice words for Boris about that and none of them are polite.) I'm just anxious, constantly, that not only might she catch it but I might be the one to give it to her. I couldn't live with that. 

I want this to be over as much as anyone else but we're not even halfway through the woods yet, let alone out of them. I hope you're doing better, researcher, because it's a fine line between monotony and despair here.
