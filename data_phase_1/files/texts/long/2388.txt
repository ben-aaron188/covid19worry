I'm rather lucky in be in a situation where I don't have to go to work, I don't have any underlying health issues, and I live in a less densely populated area/town. So in a sense I have been feeling a lower level of fear about the corona virus, because my chances of coming in to contact with the virus is a lot lower. However, I worry for my elderly relatives despite them taking the advised precautions, and I worry for friends who do still have to go in to work and live in an area that has a high amount of cases.
