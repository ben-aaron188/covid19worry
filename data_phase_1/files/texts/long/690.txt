I am a bit worried but not overly so. I can still work, I'm not ill and I can get to the supermarket without much fuss. The news is full of stories but trying to look at the positive ones. I do feel for those not in my situation. I think the government have done largely whats been required but the timeliness and presentation has been terrible. I haven't been out and its a shame that not everyone is sticking to this. I'm sure we will come out the otherside but I wonder what the long term affects will be.
