I feel sad about the deaths being caused by the situation, especially the recent death of a 13 year old and other young people without any prior known health issues. Also miss seeing my family and friends. 
Worried about the future as theres no certainty of when a vaccine will be found. Feel bored at home all day with nothing to do. Hope everyone follows the lockdown rules in order to prevent more cases. Events that I had planned in the upcoming events have had to be cancelled which makes me feel annoyed.
