I am at home at the moment, with my family, and none of us yet have experienced any illness.

However we are all locked down in the UK at the moment and I am sad that I cannot see my usual friends and family.

We are making the best of it by keeping busy, and trying to eat well, but itâ€™s a constant worry there, as I have asthma so may not fade to well.

Seeing the numbers of dead shooting up across the world every day brings me great sadness for those people and their loved ones, and particularly worry that it may also take someone I know.

We are actually quite content at home without thinking of the wider picture, and I feel that we are very lucky. We have enough food and things to keep us entertained, and we all get along very well, so actually spending more time together is very lovely, apart from the low level anxiety whenever we tv ink about what is happening.
