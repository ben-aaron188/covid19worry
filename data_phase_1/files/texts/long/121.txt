I want to go back to how things were before. I'm struggling to find the motivation to do things because we're on lockdown, even though I have lots of university work to be doing. However, I understand that lockdown is for the best and it's what's needed to get things back to normal. I am very grateful that I have my family, food and a place to stay. I am also grateful towards the NHS and all the key workers. Even though I'm struggling with being inside the house all the time and missing my friends and family a lot, I know I am very lucky to be in the position I am in now. I am also grateful that I live in a time with technology so it's so easy to stay in touch with all the people that I'm missing.
