im very nerbous and anxious about the cornovirus. i think it will get worse before it gets better. to many people are dying of it so it makes me more nervous about the whole situation it is scary thing to think about especially for the older and more vunerable people.. i think it will take a long time for the country and world to get back to normal after this as it had disfunctioned many peoples lives. i also think a lot of bysiness have been ruined and unfortunatly lost a lot of money due to this terrible time.
