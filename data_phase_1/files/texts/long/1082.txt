I’m very fearful and worried personally being 37 weeks pregnant. I’m sad that this has overshadowed the last part of my pregnancy and will impact the first few weeks/months of becoming a mother. Selfishly it has impacted me hugely, I also fear for friends and family in the at risk group and who have no choice but to continue working as a key worker and not adequately protected.  

I am worried about the future of the UK and the impact on the economy and the livelihoods so many who are currently furloughed as a result of the pandemic.
