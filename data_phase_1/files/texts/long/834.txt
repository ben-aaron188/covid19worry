I am generally very worried, but am managing to not focus too much on it and am managing not to catastrophise. 
I worry though about my children and hope they are being sensible. I worry about the effect on my grandchildren. I am managing to relax at home by not thinking too deeply about anything for any length of time. I have plenty to keep me occupied and am managing to keep in touch with everyone. I am a little anxious when I have to go shopping and am very cautious with post and parcels.  I will be glad when it's all over and will appreciate everything and everyone much more. I'm not sure I will ever stop all the hand washing!
