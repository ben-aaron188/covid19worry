I feel slight anxiety about how long this situation will go on for and the lasting impacts it will have on the economy and society as a whole. Slight fear about someone I know or myself catching the virus, although I still believe there is a relatively low chance in the area of infection in the area I am living in. Uncertainty about when and if things will go back to normal in terms of social distancing, self isolation and businesses/ organisations closing. Finally, optimistic that the virus is being effectively dealt with by governments around the world and the infection and death rates will begin to slow down and decrease in the next few weeks and months.
