I feel very relaxed about the situation. My immediate family are all at low risk. We are social distancing in the ideal situation, with a reasonably sized house and garden and no underlying health conditions. I feel mildly worried for my dad who is over 70 with high blood pressure and does not seem to be taking this seriously enough, but my overriding feeling is one of gratitude that my immediate family are in no danger and living comfortably. I am self employed and have slightly less work, but we have taken a mortgage holiday and our general outgoings are reduced by staying at home, so we don't have financial worries. I feel slight guilt that we are in such a fortunate situation whilst others are suffering and that I cannot volunteer for the NHS because my husband is already a key worker. I feel slightly sad that my children are missing out on their regular activities but aware that they are lucky to do them in normal times. I don't socialise much anyway so I am not really missing the social interaction. I feel I am in as good a position as it is possible to be in under the circumstances and I am grateful for that.
