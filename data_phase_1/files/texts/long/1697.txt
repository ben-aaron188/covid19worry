Very worried about the entire situation - being separated from family and friends while they may become sick and not being able to see them/care for them.
Concerned about my financial situation after this is all done, having not been able to earn any money during this period, but still having bills and expenses to keep up with.  Worried about the recovery process for the country, and how long this could all go on for.
Very scared that people I love will get seriously ill or worse.
Angry about people who aren't social distancing.  People who are still going out with friends or to other houses etc.  It is selfish and means more will die and those who are following social distancing can't see those we love for longer.
