currently feeling rather scared and frightened. Dread going out to work as I am a keyworker. Also all my family are keyworkers, so we are all mixing in situations which put us at risk, and then bring it home and risk affected everyone else in the household. It also annoys me to see all these people not following guidelines, makes me very annoyed that most of us take all these precautions to keep us all safe, and these idiots dont care, they are out picnicing in parks, no social distancinging. Each morning i wake up dreading to go to work, having to deal with people that have no interest in following guidelines.
