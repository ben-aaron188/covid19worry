I'm feeling quite hopeful that things will improve in the UK - the number of deaths will go down and that we'll be able to loosen restrictions soon. There is still an underlying anxiety, though - will I or someone I love get the virus? Will I and they be OK? Finances are OK at the moment but, if the situation goes on for several months, money will be very tight. I'm also a bit concerned about the lack of some essential food items in supermarkets, eg. bread and milk. Is this the beginning of more severe food shortages?
