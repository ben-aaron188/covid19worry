As a key worker I have managed to give myself a shut off period for stressing about corona and to take time to relax. At this moment, this is my time. Other time’s I experience huge feelings of anger, witnessing people who can’t adhere to advice, I have sadness all the time about how many lives are being taken, I have fear daily that I may be bringing the virus into my home by doing my job, I have fear that I have colleagues that may be more at risk than me, I have fear that people will never learn, I have fear that my children’s futures will be greatly impacted by this and I have huge fear that people will be manic or depressed as a result of this. I also now don’t feel as relaxed as when I started this!
