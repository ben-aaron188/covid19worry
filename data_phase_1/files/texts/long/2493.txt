I feel indifferent at the moment as I don’t know anyone personally affected by covid, I’m anxious because I have young children and if anything happened to me I would fear the consequences for them.
I also worry about my parents who live far away and we can’t see them at this particular time of year.
I’m finding it difficult to go out for a walk as I can’t take all of us out and I fear for jobs and the high street as it was already suffering.
I think that asking for at least 500 characters is a bit much as not everyone has the mental sense at the moment to make the most clear and concise answers.
