Anxiety about what’s to come and who it may affect.
Fear as people I know are key workers and they’re on the front line.
Worry as I am a teacher and am potentially exposed when I’m in school.
More anxiety about how schools will manage after everything’s back to normal.
Proud to be in a community that looks after each other as seen in our Facebook group and seeing signs in windows and on fences as I go out for my daily walk.
I am avoiding watching and reading the news as it makes me feel even more worry.
Everyday the situation is changing which is making me think we’ll look back at this time and think about how the world stopped for this period.
