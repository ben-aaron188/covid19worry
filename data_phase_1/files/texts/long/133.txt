I am anxious for the safety of me and my loved ones. I am angry at my employer for their attitude to staff. They have not been protecting their employees or assisting them in working from home. I am very careful about who I am in contact with at the moment.

I believe that the government have not done enough to protect its citizens in the United Kingdom. The workers in the National Health Service are doing an outstanding job, for which we should all be very grateful.

I don't have anything else to say.
