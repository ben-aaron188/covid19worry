scared shitless, on two levels, personally im scared of getting it as Im diabetic and asthmatic yet still going to work.  secondly im a front line healthcare worker, sister on a hdu, with inadequate ppe and training.  being asked to redeply to look after adults (im child trained)  plans from NHS keep changing and supplies are low. 
The reports of nurses dieing really scares me., this could be my family left without me, Im the main breadwinner, how would they cope, hoow would they cope withoutme being there.  I have kids,
