Deep-seated hopelessness; I'm someone who is chronically ill, with friends and family who have their own health concerns. I worry constantly for them, and especially for the one who most helps to look after me and the family, and for the people I can't be with in-person. It's a heavy blow to my depression and anxiety, and the past few days have been a struggle with many intrusive thoughts that worsen with each news story. Being stuck inside, in less than stellar conditions, feels like it's choking me.
