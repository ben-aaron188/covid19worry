At the moment I am still worried about the corona virus and how it may affect me and my family, but I don't feel as worried/anxious as I did this time last week and I think that this is due to the fact that I have been reading less about it.
I've also been watching the news less, like maybe just the update in the evening.
I also feel more relaxed because I know my family and I are being very careful. It's also nice to have time all together (when there's no bickering!)
I feel more relaxed and rested in general but still get anxious when one of us has to go out for food or to collect medications. 
I'm hopeful that things will be starting towards getting back to some sense of normality by May/June.
