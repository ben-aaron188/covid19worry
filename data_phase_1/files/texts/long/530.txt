I feel nervous about getting covid, and my partner getting covid.

I am scared that my family will get it and have a bad time and possibly  dying.
Worried that i wonâ€™t be able to see my family if they end up ill, spiralling thoughts lead to not being able to give family the funeral they deserve due to covid.
Worries that work will die down and I may lose my job or my husband loses his. Resulting in losing our house and belongings.
I am scared for the economy of our country and the massive strain and pressure put on the nhs in this terribly trying time
