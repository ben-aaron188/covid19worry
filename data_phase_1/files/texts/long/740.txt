I feel some anxiety about the risk to myself and my family from the virus as I am a community nurse working in the NHS. I also worry about the economic fallout from the situation regarding my retirement plans in the next few years. I fee frustration at not being able to take any sort of break, even in the UK, due to the restrictions on travel. We have a daughter aged 15 at home who is miserable because of missing her boyfriend (who lives 60 miles away) and concerned about how the lack of school will impact on her GCSEs due next year.
