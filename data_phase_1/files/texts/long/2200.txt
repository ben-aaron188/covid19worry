I think the world is in a very strange state of limbo, which is reflected in my mood. I am worried about loved ones, family and friends, who still have to go out the world. We are all in a liminal, uncertain state of being - I feel a bit hollowed out rather than any one emotion. The anxiety and fear has tapered off in recent weeks but I think this is desensitisation rather than it going away. It feels like a never ending situation that I would like the world to collectively come out of, as if exiting a bad dream.
