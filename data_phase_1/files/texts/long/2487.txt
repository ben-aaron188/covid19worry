I am worried about the situation as it doesn’t seem to be getting much better at the moment, cases are going up daily and people are flouting the rules the government set. I’m scared the rules will be tightened further and it makes me uneasy that I don’t know what the future will hold.
I’m particularly worried about my elderly parents, it upsets we I can’t see them and I desperately want them to stay well. It’s hard staying in the house all day but I don’t want to catch the virus and pass it onto anyone else. Life has changed significantly and I’m finding it hard to adapt.
