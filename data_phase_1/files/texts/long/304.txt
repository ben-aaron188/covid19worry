I go through waves but right now I feel relaxed as I've had a good day working from home. I am in a job that is relatively safe in a house with lots of room so I feel safe, although I have had mild coronavirus symptoms (cough, fatigue, muscle aches and breathlessness) for the past 10 days now along with my housemates which sometimes worry me. At the beginning I felt anxious and troubled all the time for the world but I've been learning to reign it in and not take on the world's worries and to live in the present moment so I feel more relaxed.
