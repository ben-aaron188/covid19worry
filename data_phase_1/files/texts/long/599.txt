I cry before I go to sleep more nights. I miss being able to just go out and see people. I thought I would be happy by myself but I’m lonely and I miss my family and friends. I’m concerned for my relationship with my boyfriend. He hates being on the phone and I’m struggling with this as I’m not in contact with him as much as I want to be. It’s tough to be stuck indoors with some family. They’re all very loud and some young. Teaching is hard in this environment too. I am working at Aldi so am able to socialise there which is great but there people are new to me and I want to see my old friends.
