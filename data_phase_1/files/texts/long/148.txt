My anger and disgust is more towards the people who aren’t taking the situation seriously and are still going out and endangering the others around us rather than the situation itself. The stress they are adding to the NHS and our health workers is unnecessary and unfair. Our key workers (police, nurses) are being treated with so little respect it’s disgusting.   
Yes I don’t feel very relaxed being cooped up inside for so long but I understand why that’s necessary in the prevention of spreading it.
