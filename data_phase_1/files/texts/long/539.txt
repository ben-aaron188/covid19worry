I feel angry, many travel plans were destroyed. Stuck in old job, which I wanted to change. There is a lot of fake news which make me even more angry. My wife is pregnant, I cant go with her for a scan to see and hear my future baby.  Planet earth is healing which  is one of the positive sides. I miss football - playing it, watching it. Sun is showing up after depressing 6month of horrible weather. My daughter has to stay at home which is not a positive effect on her mental stats given she is 2 years old
