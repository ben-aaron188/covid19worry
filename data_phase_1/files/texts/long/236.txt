I feel sad for everyone around the world who is affected- either directly through the illness or the economic effects on their businesses. I also feel sad at the prospect of continued limits on social interactions and nothing, such as music festivals, concerts and sports, to look forward to in the near future- I understand completely for the need for social distancing at this time. I am slightly anxious and fearful about the economic and social consequences of this pandemic and distressed about the lack of ideas for an exit strategy.
