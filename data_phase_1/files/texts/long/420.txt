I feel like a lot of people have lost their lives because of another countries actions. This is'nt new, buts its not due to a war, or a political fallout. I feel like alot of countries were too slow to act, mine included(uk)  I remember worrying news and videos in feb from china, but nothing was done in other countries then. 
i wish we could learn from this, but i feel like history shows we wont learn. I feel like in a years time, if the virus has been contained, everything will go back to normal. rich vs poor, wars, political bulls**t.
