It is quite worrying even though it said to have a 2% death rate but doesn't change the fact this varies in each region especially in the UK has more than 2% and it's spreading at a fast rate even with lockdown rules people are still going outside. False information about coronavirus is spreading aswell people believe it's not as serious as it potrayed to be although it is a good thing not be worried to much as there is people who already suffer from anxiety best option is to remain calm and collective and have a balance.
