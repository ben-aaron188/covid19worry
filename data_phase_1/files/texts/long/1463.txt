As a front line worker (emergency services) and family man I am very concerned about the current situation.  I am having to go to work as a key worker and continue to enforce the law and deal with fast moving situations.  This is nothing different to any other ‘normal’ day at work but yet there is always a concern ‘Covid -19’ and having to return home having maybe bing exposed to the virus in day to day dealings with the public.  I do try and shield my concerns and fears from my family as after all I have a job to fullfill which I am dedicated to. These are concerning times for us all.... but let’s just remember, stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives’
