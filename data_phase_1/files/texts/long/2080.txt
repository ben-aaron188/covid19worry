I feel anxious and scared as I am on immune suppressants.

I have been furloughed from my job as I work at the head office for a hotel company and the majority of our hotels are closed. 
I have to hope that the hotel business returns to normal in the future in order to guarantee my job which is a scary feeling.

I feel bored as I have nothing to do. There is only so many walks, zoom chats and watching TV that I can do. I am trying to mentally stimulate myself by doing online courses that will help me within my career.
