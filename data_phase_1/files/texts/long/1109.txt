At the beginning I didnâ€™t think that much of the virus. But once it spread to our country and there was people passing away this is when I started to feel worried. This has now made me make sure me and my family our safe. We are washing hands and not having personal contact with others, to minimise the risk of my family being infected. This should hopefully work. If the virus had not spread to the UK. I probably would not be worried about having contact with other people. I have always had the same hand hygiene. So this would not change much. But I have definitely washed my hands more often. And made sure I wash them to the best of my ability.
