I feel we aren't really strict enough with our measures in this country and a lot of businesses are taking advantage of this and still running when they shouldn't be. A lot of key workers are very worried to go to work just now. 

The business I work for has put some measures in place to socially distance ourselves a bit but the nature of our work is manufacturing, so we need to work as part of a team and work together in close contact with one another.

I am wondering what is going on with the Prime minister just now & I am wondering if someone else should be stepping in just now to run the country whilst he is in the hospital getting treatment. If he is in the hospital then it must be fairly serious.
