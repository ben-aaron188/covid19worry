I am very anxious for my children and relatives. I want normality back again for my children. I just want to do simple things like walk in the forest and 'pop' out to the shop. I just want the world to heal and this be behind us. I wish for freedom again and safety for the people who are risking so much. These people are going beyond the role that they are paid for. I hope after this that the government will realise they should be funding the NHS in a better way. I hope that our Prime Minister sees that things need to change.
