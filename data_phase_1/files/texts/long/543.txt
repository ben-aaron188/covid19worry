I'm worried about current situation and I'm worries about mine and my family's health. My financial conditions are not good and I'm frustrated about it. Food stock is very low at home and I'm worried about food stock as well.
Hopefully everything will be okay so we can live our normal life and most importantly stress level will be decreased. I'm stressed about current situation of our mortgage and insurnace, if we are not gonna earn money how we gonna pay our bills. Its is a fear type of situation and we are struggling to keep our children busy and entertained at home.
