i feel anxious mainly about the economic impact of the coronavirus more than the actual illness itself. 

I think that the action of the government is good, but ultimately it's setting up the younger working generation up for years of austerity and there doesn't seem to be a clear exit plan from the lockdown. 

It worries me that there doesn't seem to be enough PPE doctors and nurses and that there may not be enough ventilators when the virus peaks. 

I also worry about the mental health impact of the situation.
