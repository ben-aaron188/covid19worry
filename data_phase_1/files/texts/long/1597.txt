I feel quite relaxed yet a bit anxious. The structure of my day has differed a lot and I don't feel like I am accomplishing anything. I am spending most of my time relaxing and not being productive. I hope that I change the structure of my day and start being more productive. I also hope that I find a hobby to occupy me. I also feel quite sad due to not being able to see any friends or socialize. However I do feel a bit happy due to me being given time to relax from many of my studies and taking a break from many of my responsibilites. However I do find that I am quite lazy and more lethargic which usually ends me up in not completing some of my duties.
