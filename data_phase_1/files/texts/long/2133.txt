I feel anxious how corona could affect my family. I'm also worried about the upcoming months because more and more people could be losing their jobs. I'm upset because people don't listen to the advice and stay at home and make things worse by leaving the house and prolong the quarantine. I also fear the economy dropping and how it might affect the jobs in the future. I'm worried that I might get it and I would be in pain for quite some time. Overall I feel very anxious about the future and what is yet to come
