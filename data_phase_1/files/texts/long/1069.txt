feeling scared and useless , trying to get face masks so my wife can shop in safety but can't get them or even a food delivery it's getting real bad , people are still acting like it's not all that bad but more keep dying and getting infected , the news is nothing else but covid19 not sure if that helps keep me informed or keeps me scared , the world is infected and it will only get worse these next few months , Africa is yet to be hit so it will fly when it hits them ., very scary  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
