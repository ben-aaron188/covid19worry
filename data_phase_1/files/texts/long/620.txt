I feel anxious that people arenâ€™t taking the virus seriously and potentially harming people - it seems incredibly arrogant. I also feel anxious about going outside, I do not go to the shops and would rather exercise at home rather than go out for a walk. I feel fearful for vulnerable people, it must be incredibly scary to already know that you are at greater risk. I feel sad for things that are missed, life events, milestones such as weddings, funerals, graduations etc. I feel grateful for my home and garden, I feel very aware of my privilege.
