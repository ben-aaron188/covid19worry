Feeling relaxed at home. I will currently at home for next five days as work has changed to one week on one week off, feel anxious incase a family member comes down with virus and needs hospitalised couldnâ€™t cope not being with them during hospitalisation. I feel slightly angry that some people are really not taking lockdown seriously or they are not following guidelines given to protect as best we can. Kind of hoping that lockdown can be relaxed sooner rather than later. Testing would be good all round.
