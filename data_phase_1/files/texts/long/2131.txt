I feel very scared for myself, my family and my friends. I feel scared that I might die or they might die and not being able to say goodbye to each other.

I am frightened of going out because it's hard to avoid other people.

I am angry at Government for not heeding the 2019 Biosecurity advice from Scientists that another epidemic would happen at some point and that the UK should prepare and hold stocks.

I feel angry at the Government for not acting earlier on the clear WHO advice to do everything: test, test, test + contact tracing + social distancing.

I feel angry that elderly people are not being looked after properly. I saw an elderly man with a walking stick and a shopping bag join a queue outside Sainsburys the other day - the queue was 3 streets long and not moving.

I feel angry and disgusted that the Government didn't provide adequate PPE early enough for all of those that need it. Doctors and nurses have died because of exposure to corona virus, as have bus drivers and care workers. Care home workers still don't have protection, other than their usual apron and gloves.

I feel desire to help but I feel helpless.

I feel desire go out and live normally and to see my family and friends.
