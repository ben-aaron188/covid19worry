Concerned as to how long the regulations that have been brought into place will last for, but at the same time aware of the reasoning behind the restrictions imposed. 

Having been working from home/voluntarily isolating (though no symptoms) for around 3 weeks now, feel like I’ve settled into the rhythm of the isolation and dealing with things on a daily basis whilst monitoring the news for updates. 

Work can be stressful but this is due to the systems that we are supporting and the staff who’re working remotely due to the COVID-19 situation. However our manager is supervising this and trying to minimise this where possible.
