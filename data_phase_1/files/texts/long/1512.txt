I feel anxious about the situation that we are in, and hearing about all the sudden and unexpected deaths due to covid-19. Angry at the people who are not listening to government advise about staying indoors to avoid the spread. Sad at the fact I can't see loved ones. But also at peace knowing that my family and those close to me are doing all they can to help others and stay safe, and we are able to pick up new skills and in the time we do have at home. Jealous of people who have children to entertain them during boredom.
