I feel quite relaxed and secure regarding my personal situation but my anxiety stems from my partner losing his job as the company he works for has filed for bankruptcy and also I feel that there is a minority of people who are not paying enough attention to the social distancing recommendations and staying at home unless it is essential they leave their homes.
Also at the moment, no one in my close family or friends has suffered any severe effects of Coronavirus so I do not (yet) feel personally affected by it.  I am doing all I can though to socially distance myself from everyone outside of my household which only includes myself and my partner.
