I feel sad that this situation has arisen and long for 'normality' to return, but hope that when normality returns people remember to appreciate the important things in life. As the situation is ultimately out of my control I feel fairly relaxed as there is nothing I can do about it, but look forward to a vaccine being created. I think the UK government has responded to the crisis quite well. I wonder how much longer they can keep up the lockdown without there being significant issues and do worry that there appears to be no restriction on who can travel into the country as even if we do get on top of the virus spreading, there is nothing to stop someone bringing the virus back again from overseas.
