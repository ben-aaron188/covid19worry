I feel reasonably relaxed about the whole situation. i am spending lots of time at home with the family whilst on furlough, looking after my son whilst my wife works from home. Personally, i am reasonably fit and healthy. so is my family, therefore not overly anxious if we were to catch it. I also feel its a good reset for the world in terms of spending time with family, less travel, less pollution out there, more outside exercise, more eating fresh foods. It’s obviously horrible for the people that are effected through death of family members. And i’m hoping we don’t get effected in this way
