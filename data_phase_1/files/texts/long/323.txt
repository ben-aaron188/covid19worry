I feel scared and feel physically sick when I think about the situation a lot. I have friends who are nurses and care workers or other key workers and the general public has no real idea of what is going on. The extent to which this is causing problems for our NHS. I feel sad for my relatives who have health conditions and those that have lost their jobs. It's a scary time.
I am worried about the future of the economy once this is over. It's something that has never happened before so that creates huge anxiety.
