It is a worrying time for personal and professional reasons, but as a family we are trying to keep a sense of perspective. Health is the main priority- I am sad and frustrated at being separated from family, but glad if time with my children. I am worried about other family members with underlying issues, who are vulnerable, as well as another family member who works in the NHS. We have a close family member overseas who is in the final stages of a terminal illness and cannot get hospital care. It hurts not to be able to hold their hand and say goodbye. My eldest should be taking his GCSEâ€™s this year, which has generated additional anxiety and I was furloughed last week. There is much uncertainty about the future, but the fact that everyone is in the same situation makes it easier to bear.
