I am worried about how people are going to cope with the long period of isolation. This may have negative effects on my mental wellbeing but as a society I think it will be even worse. People might start leaving the house after a month or two because theyre bored, or need social interation, which will cause the situation to go on for longer. I'm also worried about how the governments handling the situation and whether they are fully equipped. They havent been providing clear instructions to workers and the elderly.
