I have had two job offers taken away from me due to this situation, untold frustrated at this as I worked really hard across several interviews. The level of mismanagement of the situation by the government is appalling - no plan, no idea and no planning. Shambles.
People are being used as cannon fodder, NHS staff, gig economy staff are all being sacrificed in the fights to save lives. 
Lies upon lies, denial and more lies by the government leadership team, they don't know their numbers nor do they have an ability to tell the truth. 
Our family is separated due to age and health, no government support to care for them, community, family have done more for them than the government has. 
The lack of planning has led to this ongoing outcome.
