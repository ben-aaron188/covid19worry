I feel saddened by the fact that the coronavirus will be ruining the spring and summer months and that the turning of the weather will not be able to celebrated in the normal way. I am also saddened by the fact that my final term of teaching and living in my university city has been disrupted and I will not be able to say goodbye to a city I have called home for 3 years. 
I also feel distressed by the fact that my elderly family members are unable to continue on with their normal lives and are stressed and worried about this entire pandemic.
