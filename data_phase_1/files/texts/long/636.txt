I feel as if I'm in a fortunate position of being able to maintain a relaxing lifestyle living with my girlfriend, simply spending more leisure time at home than usual (I worked from home before covid-19 anyway). 

The thought of people I know and hold dear being affected is anxiety-inducing, but thankfully hasn't been much of an issue thus far, but that could change easily. 

Overall it's just a bit surreal, easy to get used to ,but at the same time very strange when you remember how different your schedule is now, i.e. there's nothing on it..(except for some quizzes on zoom which are going down a storm tbf!) 
I desire a return to normality, economic stability (I'm a freelancer, but my slightly dropped income has been compensated by fewer pennies spent at the pub) and being able to watch football and go out to the pub with friends, but all of that has to come at the right time, the last thing we want is to be off travelling about and then experience a resurgence of the virus.
