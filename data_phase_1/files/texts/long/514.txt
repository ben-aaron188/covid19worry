I don't have any feelings regarding the virus as for me it's a normal day as I continue to do the same things. Now and again I'm anxious however this is a rare occurrence. It can be scary with the amount of deaths there have been and there is no cure or vaccine for this. I have hope that this can be beaten if we as a country and the world unite together. I feel that this is going to be a long process and we all need to be safe and follow the rules that have been set. It angers me when people blatantly disregard the rules and put other peoples life at risk.
