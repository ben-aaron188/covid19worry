Im very anxious I don’t even like leaving the house for essentials. I’m sad all the time I can’t watch the news. I just wish everyone would do what they are told and it will start to work. I’m working from home and even though I’m lucky enough to have my husband with me. I miss people. Especially my family. I have never not seen them for this amount of time. I’ve already missed Mother’s Day and next easter. I feel sad I may even miss my mums 70th birthday. We have cancelled travel plans. We haven’t been able to get the deposit back as they are only offering future cruise credit.
