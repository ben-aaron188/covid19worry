Feeling quite helpless in the situation as there is not much to do but sit at home and wait. It's also been quite boring and tedious listening to negative updates on the situation as there doesn't seem to be any resolve anytime soon.
It has been very frightening hearing about the effects the disease is having on people, especially those with pre existing health conditions. 
I am hopeful that the situation will be resolved by June and a sense of normalcy will return afterwards but afraid the aftermath may be long and difficult for most in this country and the world.
