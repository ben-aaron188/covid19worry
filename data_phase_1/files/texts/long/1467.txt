Annoyed at the timing as I am recently self employed but and slightly anxious about effects on work but otherwise fine. As I am a landscaper and gardener it is just like a less busy period over winter etc. Looking forward to returning to normal but slightly concerned at missing my peak income over the spring and summer period. Also slight concern for more vulnerable members of my family. Currently mostly self isolating but still working as I am able to work alone with no contact with many of my customers. Have stopped any work that does or would contain direct contact. Going on a walk on days I am not working in an attempt to stay fit but during lockdown eating seems to be a go to because of boredom.
