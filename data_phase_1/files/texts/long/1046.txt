I'm incredibly angry at how the situation has been dealt with. It is now clear the government acted too late. The possibility of a 20,000 death toll is absolutely inexcusable. The lack of testing and sufficient allocation of PPE, has costed the lives of many front line workers. This was absolutely a political choice, for which I will never forgive the government. Instead of spending billions on weapons we will never use, all we needed was some social cooperation and fabric masks. The cheek of the PM to use words like ""operation last gasp"" have just added fuel to the fire. I could go on for ages describing the utter contempt and despair I feel at the moment.
