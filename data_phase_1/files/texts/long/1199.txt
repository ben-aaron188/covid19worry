I am worried about my family catching the virus but not particularly worried about myself catching it
I am concerned about my personal job situation if the lockdown continues for a long time
I feel very sad about all the people very ill and dying and those people that lose friends and family especially when I think that they won't get a chance to say goodbye to their love ones as you would normally
The scale of the pandemic and the numbers of people are scary
I get angry at those people who do not appear to be taking the situation seriously and flout the lockdown rules
