The situation brings about a lot of uncertainty which naturally raises fear as we do not know how the future looks like. I am grateful I still have my income, the lockdown situation has helped me save money which makes me happy. However I am concerned for those families who do not have an income or the support they need. It has raised some feelings of anxiety in terms of the precautions which have to be taken when going outdoors. It is scary how fast the situation can change and seeing the news be about nothing but coronavirus.
