I am worried for the safety of my son as, of course, I still have to leave the house and am fearful of contracting the virus while out or passing it along to him. I am a little angry (though rather more annoyed) with people who flout social distancing guidelines and continue to meet in large social groups or travel unnecessarily as they are preventing others from returning to normality.
I also worry that I go out too much, however these are only for trips to the shop for food for myself or vulnerable family members, though I know there is more I could do.
