I feel sad for the people who has suffered as a result of the corona virus. I am also worried about my parents who are in the at risk group.  I hope that the UK does not go into full lockdown because I think that people need to e able to go outside and exercise once a day. This is vital for mental health reasons and also to get the much needed vitamin c which is needed to boost the immune system. I also hope that the current lockdown does not get extended to long. This is because lots of people have lost their jobs and they have no money coming in to pay their bills. I hope that the country can get back to normal in soon.
