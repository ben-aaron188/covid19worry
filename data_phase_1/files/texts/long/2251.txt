I am concerned about how many people are getting it. I feel anxious that I can’t be with my friends and family and I’m scared they will contract coronavirus and I won’t get to be with them. I am angry at people who are abusing the system and still going out. I worry about the future of society. I know my job is safe and I am grateful but I am worried for those who have lost their job. I fear for the brave key workers putting their lives on the line and risking everything to save the population.
