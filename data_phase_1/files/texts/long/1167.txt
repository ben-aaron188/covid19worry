The future is extremely uncertain and nobody knows how long this crisis will last for. I am really anxious and somewhat fear for the future, many opportunities have been ruinied for me because of this pandemic and as a result I am no longer as confident or less stressed as I was before this crisis.
I fear for the lives of many loved ones around me, knowing that it takes just one person to be infected to be able to infect an netire household really scares me. If a patient in a hospice or retirement home get infected, it is extremely likely that everyone in the entire building would be infected, which is extremely lethal for the old and others who have pre-existing diseases.
