At this very moment I am fairly relaxed about the Corona situation. I purposefully only read the news online in the mornings then avoid it for the rest of the day (by not watching tv, not going on Facebook but rather just Instagram and YouTube). When I think about the future, the health of my family, the security of our jobs and the economy etc I can get worries and I am worried by the fact there is no end date to lockdown as of yet and also when lockdown is lifted, how can we be sure to keep ourselves fit and healthy? But day to day I am pragmatic - I take each day as it comes and at the moment I am enjoying taking this time to do some DIY and odd jobs around the house. This keeps me busy and my mind off the situation.
