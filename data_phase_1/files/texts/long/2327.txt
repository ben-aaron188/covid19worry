I am feeling a bit unmotivated to carry on with normal life as I am unsure about this situation and how long it will last. I am worried that it could take a year or more for life to fully resume. I am annoyed that some people can't follow rules in place to try and help save lives. I am happy to have a home where I am safe and have my partner with me for companionship. I am feeling a bit trapped inside and I have not been doing as much exercise as usual so I think this will negatively affect my health. I am a bit worried when I leave the house that I could end up contracting the disease.
