I’m not scared of the virus itself, I just have some anxiety over what our normal will be once this is all over. What our financial state will be for my family and many others, will my partner still have a job after this? Will my job go back to normal ( nhs ). So many unanswered questions that nobody knows the answer too yet, I wish more people would abide by the rules though we have been told to stay at home, only go out when nessacary and get people still aren’t following these rules which will result in longer lockdown for the UK!
