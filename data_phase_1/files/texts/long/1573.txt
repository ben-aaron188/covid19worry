I feel anxious for the health of those who are close to me who are vulnerable, for example my grandparents. I am not only worried about them catching Coronavirus, but also about their mental health being cooped up and not having anyone visit.  I am worried for the economy as a whole, but luckily my job is stable and I can do it from home. I miss seeing my friends and family, but I am lucky I live with my boyfriend and we are enjoying this time together. It has been nice to slow down and enjoy the beautiful weather from our balcony. I am afraid I will become less fit and healthy from staying inside all the time, but I am enjoying reading lots and watching good films.
