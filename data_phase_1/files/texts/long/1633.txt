I am anxious about being redeployed in my job and not knowing what to do and meeting new people 
I am angry at too many people still going out in the sunshine; I want them to stay home as much as they can; no one should be out apart from certain reasons
I hope my family and friends stay well and do not get affected by this terrible virus
I fear them getting ill at this time
I hope the prime minister gets better and gets out of hospital soon 
I am worried about it spreading on any surface and knowing what to touch
