I feel sadness and anxiety, I feel so sorry for those individuals who are on their own with no one to support them. Loneliness is such a horrible thing. I trust the government and believe that they are doing the right thing with stay safe stay at home help the NHS. 
I'm feeling more grateful than I ever have done for the NHS it's just so very precious. 
I feel sad for those people who have passed away on their own and that their friends and family did not have a chance to say goodbye to them.
