I feel scared that I may get it due to being immune-compromised and that scares me. I am also worried about my family's health too. I miss seeing my friends and work colleagues but I also understand this is for the better as I could give or get coronavirus. I am going a bit crazy being stuck in the house and I never thought I would look forward to going food shopping each week! Although I am scared I am also proud of our NHS and how big companies like Dyson are working hard to combat this and make products to help. I am dissapointed in how some people aren't taking the lockdown seriously and are going out or meeting.
