I am upset and annoyed at the virus and how many it is killing, harming and the damage it is doing to businesses, people's livelihood etc. I am not myself worried about contracting the virus or on how it will affect my income, thankfully. It has put a halt to everyones life which is an annoyance but hopefully it will be over and we can once again return to how we used to be. I miss friends, football and my daily life but i know that they arent playing second fiddle to this virus, i want people to respect it and stay indoors and listen to the government guidance.
