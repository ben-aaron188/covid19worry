I feel that whilst this is a huge problem that is happening globally, there are so many different news reports that I believe are just playing off of the collective fear we are all feeling in this time. It is hard to know who to trust or what to believe. It is awful that people are dying because of this disease! For me, praying has really helped me and so has my faith in God. So it makes this whole situation a bit easier to cope with and live through. I do hope that we come out of lockdown and that this is all sorted soon. It would be nice for the world to return to normal!
