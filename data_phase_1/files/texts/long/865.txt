I am not scared of the virus, I know that if I got the virus thew most likely outcome would be that i survive. I am slightly worried about the health and well being of my older family and friends. i am quite relaxed in quarantine. I am being very productive and am managing lots of lie-ins. My back pain has been worse since quarantine however. I am speaking to my friends online a lot and am keeping in touch with my family. The state of the world does not scare me i feel if we all just stay at home the virus will pass. one thing which does annoy and anger me is people, especially celebrities and influencers, spreading fake news and rumours such as the 5G towers giving people covid-19, which has no evidence and i would say is utter BS.
