I have been furloughed from today due to corona. It’s disappointing that people aren’t following social distancing rules either impacting everyone’s potential freedom during the lockdown. My partner is working from home and I’m looking after our 13 month old son but I have to go out to get groceries. It makes me anxious going shopping and potentially bringing something back to infect my family. I’m disappointed with the Chinese cover up and how they have no respect for life at all and carry on eating the weird and wonderful. I hope governments across the world impose sanctions on them for literally ruining many people’s lives.
