i am worried to contract the virus as my husband had athsma and i dont want him to get ill, we are both self isolating, but i need to shop once a fortnight to get food, i know lots of people who have got ill and died as a result, i have lost my job due to shop having to close and dont know when this will end.  I dont go outside except to garden, there is only so much you can do when you havent got an income to get new plants for the garden.  Such worrying times my daughter is expecting our first grandchild in august and her partner is a teacher and has to work.
