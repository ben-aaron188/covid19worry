Feeling a bit lost at the fact we don't know how long the lock down will last. Anger at the people ignoring the lock down and social distancing guidelines and dragging the time out further. Sad that my child is missing out on his last few months at nursery school and he'll be straight in to Reception full days in September, and that my toddler is having to miss out on all his playgroups. Angry that I finally got us in to a routine that works and helps my mental health but now we are thrown in to days of nothing
