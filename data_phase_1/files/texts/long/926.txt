The whole situation is unnerving and quite scary. The world had completely turned upside down in the matter of weeks/months and there is no certainty about how long it will be until normality returns. It is worrying as its likely and probable that myself and my loved ones will contract coronavirus at some point - it's almost inevitable. Its just hoping that none of us get a very serious, deadly, version of the illness. It is scary that going outside for your daily exercise of for essentials could be the cause of you contracting a serious virus - especially when people are not observing the social distancing rules. Living in London especially, shops are generally small and it is not possible to stay 2m from other people, which puts myself and my family at an increased risk.
