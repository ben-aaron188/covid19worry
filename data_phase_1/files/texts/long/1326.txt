I feel very angry with the people who are still going out and not staying at home. People think it's okay to still visit public places like parks to visit friends when the death rates are increasing and because of these people, we will have to stay quarantined for longer. I haven't stepped outside for 3 weeks now and I honestly think these people are selfish because before even thinking about people in the quarantine they should think about the NHS. They are working with sweat and anxiety just to keep people alive and the more people go out the more the NHS staff will suffer and so would we. I'm angry and upset. Look at the casualties!!! I just hope a cure or a way to decrease I immensely would be found and we could all stop worrying about dying...
