I feel uneasy as there is a lot that is unknown about the economy in terms of employment etc. Quite a lot of anxiety had been created in terms of not knowing what the future holds and what is generated on social media, which a lot of is “fake news”. The fact that there is not an end date insight does contribute to a less positive outlook within day to day life and yet again creates a sense of anxiety. I also feel a sense of frustration seeing other citizens being unable to follow government advice when it comes to social distancing.
