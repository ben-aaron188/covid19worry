I am unlikely (although not certain) to be greatly affected individually given my demographic.

 I am annoyed, disgusted and angered with the British government's response (or lack of) to the pandemic and the herd immunity idea was particularly callous and disgraceful. Thousands of deaths could have been avoided given the time they had to prepare for this and they have blood on their hands.

I'm quite content to stay indoors to avoid the spread of the virus and the vast majority of people are doing the right thing.
