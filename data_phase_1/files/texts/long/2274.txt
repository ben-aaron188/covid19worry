I feel OK about it, it's a concern but my job is secure. Everyone I know is safe. I'm enjoying the community spirit at the minute. Many people have felt isolated by it but I dont. I feel more included and more connected than ever before. However, I'm a little concerned that too many people are going out, we will be on full lock down before we know it!! I don't want to be on lock down because I want to be able to go for a walk, all the while keeping my distance from others . It's annoying that a lot of people don't seem to be able to follow these rules or understand the importance of it.
