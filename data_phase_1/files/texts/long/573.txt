Uncertain, anxious and scared. Angry that this happened and worried for my own health as well as my family. 
Anxious to even go out for essentials as you do not know who has it and who does not. These people may not know they have it but are spreading this virus by not keeping to the government guidelines.
Angry that some people in my country are not sticking to guidelines and will make this lockdown last for longer.
Also agitated. Being stuck in every day and not having my usual routine. 
Uncertain on when this will end, if my job will be safe after it all, if the economy will recover from this.
