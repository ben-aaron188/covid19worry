I am feeling very angry at people who are ignoring the conditions set by the government for the lockdown and are still going outside for non necessary travel. I’m fearful for the high risk people in my family and what could happen to them if they got the disease. I’m also scared for the people who can’t work from home and will be struggling for money, also scared for people who are living pay check to pay check. I’m a student in my first year of college so I’m annoyed I have to teach myself content I don’t even understand. The only good thing I think has come out of it is how it has united communities together and how people have shown their support for. The worker in the NHS has been very moving.
