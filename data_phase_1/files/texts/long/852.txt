I'm concerned about my family, one of whom is a key worker, the other is a vulnerable person.  I have some anxiety as I am also in the vulnerable category due to my health issues.  I am worried that an enforced lockdown will be required due to some individuals bending and breaking the rules on a regular basis. I feel that the government didn't act quickly enough to instils social distancing practices, and that the previous advice of achieving ""herd immunity"" (with the potential loss of 200,000 lives) was medically unsound and a political bullet to the foot, which caused the whole world to take a very dim view of the UK in general.  While I think it is admirable that the government wants to increase testing across the nation (far too late, however), but there has been no thought of how these tests are going to be processed, and of the infrastructure and human resources needed to process all of the tests.  It's a mess.
