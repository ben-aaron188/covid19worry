I really feel fine, I have all my family home with me and I am able to work from home fairly easily. I am missing my friends and going out as a group but that will pass. Would like to take the kids to visit my dad but he is 80 and is in isolation that is the only thing I am worried about personally.

On a wide scale i feel very sorry for those losing loved ones without being able to say goodbye and all the little kids losing grandparents.

I am concerned about the effects of the lockdown and the wide effects that will have on society as the economy has slowed right down. I hope the government supports everybody and the cost of borrowing remains low so everyone has a chance to get back on track.
