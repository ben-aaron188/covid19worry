Although I feel sad that so many lives are being lost but I also feel resigned to the situation. My anxiety is linked to a very elderly parent for whom I have become the sole carer which I find quite stressful. I am not unduly concerned about my own health as such only how it would potentially impact my parent if I became ill. 
I am frustrated by some aspects of the government's response ano am not convinced that stringent measures were activated soon enough. It is also frustrating me that some members of society appear not to be taking lockdown measures seriously. If the 'actions of a few' result in outside exercise being banned I shall feel angry and would prefer for those who flout the regulations be heavily fined rather than simply being 'moved on' by police.
