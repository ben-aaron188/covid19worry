My grandad is currently hospitalised with the coronavirus so I am feeling sad and anxious about that at this time. I am worried he is not going to survive and that I won’t be able to be there for my grandma. I also feel angry that this has happened and feel that this is an attempt at a population cull that has escalated out of hand. I feel anxious that other members of my family will contract the virus as well. I feel angry that some people aren’t following the lockdown rules and don’t seem fazed if they contract or spread the virus.
