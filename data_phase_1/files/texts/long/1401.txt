I feel many different emotions, ranging from lucky and invincible to a person waiting with deep dread to catch a virus so utterly devastating. 
I’m one of those still working but not in the nhs or anything vital and there are times where I feel like a forgotten statistic, I can’t afford not to work, I have no choice but to go, but am not acknowledged or deserving of thanks.
I work Monday to Friday, where the world seems normal then spend the weekends in lockdown, it feels half hearted and part time.
