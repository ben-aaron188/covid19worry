Anxious and confused about when life will go back to normal, frustrated that not a lot of information is available has been provided by the government. I'm feeling sad that I can't be with friends or family and self isolation is a very difficult period for anyone to be going through and makes me and others feel very lonely and distant from the outside world. Mainly it feels like a waiting game to see how the virus reacts to lockdown measures and hopefully should be decreasing very soon, seeing the death figures is also very frightening and sobering to see how many people are being affected by this globally
