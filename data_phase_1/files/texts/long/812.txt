At this moment my main anxiety or worry over the coronavirus is about the economy.  I am concerned whether the country can return to a `normal' state and how long this will take.  I am concerned about my own income in the longer term as I work in the social care sector which is very stretched financially having to find extra resources to cover the staff sickness.  I am also concerned about the health of my loved ones though several of my older more vulnerable relatives including my father passed away last year.
