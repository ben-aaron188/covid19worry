Need certainty of sight of the end of social distancing and restrictions on freedom of movement.

Want social places to re-open. Feel that pressures on NHS are being managed and capacity is not reached. Think there is a sense in shifting approach to the herd once again and not total lockdown.

Govt being clear with a timeframe would help, even if this was somewhere in May. I would not be prepared to remain observing these terms post-May.

Remain concerned at becoming an authoritarian society, but equally very concerned about breakdown of social cohesion and criminal activity and loss of law and order.
