I'm feeling quite apathetic about coronavirus. I am tired of it being the only thing on the news, and the only thing people talk about. I'm fine with social distancing and staying inside as it's what i normally do anyways but there are other issues in the world that aren't this virus, there's wars, hunger, climate change and it seems to be the only thing people talk about so am just tired of it. So in all am not really feeling much about the specific virus and just feeling like I can't feel anything towards it.
