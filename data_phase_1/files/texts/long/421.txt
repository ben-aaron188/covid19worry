I feel fortunate to not have been directly affected by it at the moment but am worried about what may happen in the future as we have not reach the peak yet. I am worried about my mother working and exposing herself to the virus and bringing it into our home. I am thankful for the hard work the key workers are putting into helping the nation but anxiety persists due to the uncertainty of the situation. I am currently enjoying isolation as I get to spend a bit more time pursuing hobbies and personal interests but wonder how much longer the lockdown will carry on for.
