I feel quite strange and scared to be honest and feel upset that I can't see my family and I feel like I don't really want to go out as I feel safe at home. I just want it all to be over and everyone to be ok which I don't think is going to happen anytime soon. When I do go out at the moment it is just to the shop to get food and I go out to exercise maybe twice a week I miss going out as I like to run with my friends from a running club I am at but cant even do that at the min so having to run on my own which I don't like really.
