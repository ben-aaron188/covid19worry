I generally feel ok regarding the virus as it’s quite easy to keep busy at home with the kids and not take too much notice of social media and other news outlets. The biggest thing at present is that I can’t see my friends and family and enjoy the usual freedoms of life.
I’m also a keyworker so work life goes on fairly similar, although our services are dramatically reduced to emergency work only. People in work are quite stressed and this can breed further anxieties in the office. 
I have two young children so my main concern Is their wealth fair and making sure I can protect them
