I feel quite relaxed about the whole situation. In some ways my personal situation is not much affected as I have a chronic health issue that means I have to stay home most of the time anyway. I also lost my son 12yrs ago, so nothing much phases me now, I have come face to face with death and dealt with the worst as far As I'm concerned. I live quite a simple sustainable life and grow some food and enjoy crafting and making things and that hasn't changed. I am also lucky enough to live in a property I own myself, and have no financial concerns. 

What does make me feel sad is all the grief people are experiencing because their life's are broken and or disrupted. I feel sad for people losing loved ones and having to deal with that alone without friends or family around. I feel compassion for others healing with fear and anxiety as the world changes. 

I have hope and desire that the world will change for the better and this period will give the earth a rest and people will in future focus on things that really matter and not just revert back to overconsuming etc.  I live in hope
