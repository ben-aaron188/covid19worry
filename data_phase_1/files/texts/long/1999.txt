I think things are improving in the UK. However I am fearful that I might get infected and pass it on to those that I live with. I also worry that lockdown will last for ever and I'll never see the sea or my friends again. You get your hopes up and then something on the news takes it away again. I have trouble sleeping. My world has shrunk to the size of a pea and I can no longer hug anyone. It's the uncertainty that is also getting to me. When will it end? I am very tired and sleep deprived. If it wasn't for my garden it would be impossible to cope.
