I miss my friends and my life as normal. Being in the house 23/7 is getting grating. 
The news is mixed and varies every day. 

We don’t know what the future holds. Checking in on everyone I know is getting exhausted. 

Fear what will happen as this progresses. So many people have already died. The economy has crashed. What will happen to us? We can’t hide inside for ever can we?

Working from home has certainly taken some getting used and I fear my job will suffer because of it.  I miss the variety and freedom my life had just a few weeks ago.
