it is worrying and saddening to know its taking lives of nhs staff and is so random in who it affects. I think there needs to be stricter measures for safety. It is a difficult time for people from all walks of life especially those who are poorer and live in bad households where there is for example, domestic abuse. It is affecting everyone in both the same and different ways and I feel like it will take time for this country to recover. I lost my job and this really saddened me but i understand how important it is for this to happen for safety of those vulnerable and everyone from this co-vid19.
