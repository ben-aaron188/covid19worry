I feel apprehensive, worried more about vulnerable friends and family and people I cannot travel to see. I am annoyed at the lackadaisical attitude of some people from all generations who are not following advice. No government in the world has experienced this before, so time will tell which have made the best decisions for their population. 
I am worried about my income situation in a few months time, paying rent and getting food when others buy in bulk. I am conscious that it is difficult to force people to stay indoors and I know people whose jobs cannot be done online who have had to relinquish their jobs because employers are not classed as essential.
