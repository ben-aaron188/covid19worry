Mainly, I feel worried at the moment.  Worried about how long the outbreak will last, and the associated health risks for myself,  my family and friends.  Also i am worried about the economy and personally,  my own job security.  The longer this situation continues,  the more worrying it is, as I think the economic impact will take longer to recover from. For example,  it it continues for the next three to six months, I think that it will take the country and the economy at least as long again to fully recover from it.
