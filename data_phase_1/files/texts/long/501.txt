I'm very worried about the corona situation at the moment as I feel people still aren't taking it seriously enough still out and about visiting relatives and letting their children play in the streets. I fear for my family and their health as they are very high risk and if they contract the virus I would be terrified. I also feel like the government left it too long to go into lockdown and they're not doing enough as they have refused ventilators from some manufacturers and aren't giving NHS staff the PPE they need.
