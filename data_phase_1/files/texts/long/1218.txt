As I am in the vulnerable section due to having 3 autoimmune diseases, my fear and worries are more heightened than others I'm speaking with. My parents are extremely worried about me (even though I am 25) and are calling me every day to make sure I am staying home. I'm frustrated by other peoples ignorance, even some distant family, who are ignoring the risks and government advice/commands regarding staying home. I fear for a lot of people, not just myself. I have hope in humanity and that people will pull together for the safety of everyone, although, I have been told I am naive for hoping this.
