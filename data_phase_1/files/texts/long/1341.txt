Frustrated and anxious about the not knowing of when this will come to an end as some are hoping within 3 weeks we’ll be back to normal and some are saying it could be 6 months to a year.  I am bored with having to stay home running out of things to do to keep myself occupied. Sad that I had things planned that now aren’t going to go ahead as I had been looking forward to them. I am worried for friends and family who have increased risks with contracting corona virus and I’m worried about generally contracting it as more healthy people are dying from it. Frustrated with people who are still going out and meeting friends and family outside of their household and are not taking it seriously. Similarly annoyed with people who are scaremongering with ridiculous stories and conspiracies about the illness.
