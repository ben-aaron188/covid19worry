Very worried for myself and my family, some of my family have health issue and i am concerned for them. Hopefully this will go soon.  i am also worried this may come back year after year. Also that it may effect the economy and my job. I think if we do get a vaccine it will put mine and a lot of other peoples minds at rest. I have tried to limit the amount of time i am researching and looking into the virus as doing so makes me worry more and more. I am off work at the moment which is making me more anxious about this and i am trying to keep as busy as possible so i can avoid thinking about this and causing myself more stress.
