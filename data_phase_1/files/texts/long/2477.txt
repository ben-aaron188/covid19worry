I'm angry because I feel the government were too slow to shut everything down, because they cared more about the economy than people's lives (see Johnson's  ""herd immunity"" comments), and now we're losing doctors and nurses, and one of my best friends has lost her mum. Yet we *knew* this was coming, weeks before it hit us. It's unconscionable. I'm also angry because our shelf-stackers, delivery drivers, nurses, and all the other working folk who we have *always* needed to keep the country running, have been so badly treated for so many years, but are suddenly ""angels"" and are getting bonuses, only now. I wonder how long it will take the establishment to re-brand them as benefit-scroungers again.  I'm also angry to see reports about people being evicted, and every other misuse of power from those with money against those without. I'm also terribly sad, not just for my friend, but for all the families who have lost people, and all the people living in fear (like my 40-something, immunocompromised neighbour who has been told to not leave his house, yet still has to go to hospital every three weeks for blood transfusions). For all the bad feeling towards China for being the origin of this virus, the figures suggest they have handled it much better than the west.
