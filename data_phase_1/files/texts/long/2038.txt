I feel anxious because my husband is classed as a vulnerable adult due to ongoing treatment from a bone marrow transplant and is still on immunosuppressants. Concerned for other vulnerable people too including my grandparents. the whole situation seems a bit surreal and am a bit annoyed at some people for not adhering to government advise with lockdown. I think that the authorities need to take a stronger stance with people who are violating the advice given.  
My current situation is my husband living in a van due to me coming down with symptoms- i have only been out of the house once in the past month to the shops and have managed to catch something. makes me feel very vulnerable because it seems to be so contagious
