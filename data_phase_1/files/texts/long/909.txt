Right now, having just read the evening news, I feel frustrated and anxious.  Frustrated because nobody seems to have a coherent, or consistent, plan to help the world get through this.   I feel that we are going to have to suffer after effects for a long time.   All of those oldies like me who are being very good and staying in are going to come out of hiding and the virus is going to say .. ""Hey, fresh meat!"" and we are going to be very vulnerable.   I find myself praying that all those people who, I know, are working frenetically to make a vaccine, or even medication, will come up with something very soon 
I miss  hugging my family, I see my sons, who are doing my shopping for me.   My daughter and daughter in law are in the NHS and my granddaughter is a key worker, and my nieces are nurses.  I am terribly worried for them.  I pray for them.  They are mine     I lost my husband two years ago and I still hurt from that.  The world must be full of people all feeling something similar.  How vulnerable the human race is!   Reading about different countries approaches is a study in itself.   Some leaders inspire confidence and others, particularly one, inspire terror.  
Today is my 24th day self isolating (by order of the family ..I'm 81) and the sun is out and I felt a lift of spirits but then the reality of the situation hits again and it feels surreal and I'm afraid again.
