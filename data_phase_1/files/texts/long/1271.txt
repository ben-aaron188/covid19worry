Im very concerned and anxious. Due to COVID-19 I have no income and worries about when I can work again. I’m also worried that my parents or someone close to me might get sick and might not make it. There is so much uncertainty and I am getting really upset by it all. I know it isn’t forever but it feels like it at times. I’m wanting everyone to take it seriously and stay at home so we can get over this quickly. 
This whole situation is making me depressed. Social media is not helping as all the celebrities are living their fancy lifestyles and separated from normality.
