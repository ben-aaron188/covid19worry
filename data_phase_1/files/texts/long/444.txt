I feel very anxious about the financial impact of the lockdown on my job. I handed my notice in at work just before this happened and now it is extremely difficult to find a new role I'm left in 'limbo'. I miss my family very much but we keep in contact daily. Video calls have now become a big part of my life and a big part of the contact that I have with my family and my friends. I also feel very grateful that I and my loved ones are healthy. Generally this is a very anxiety-provoking time and I look forward to it being over.
