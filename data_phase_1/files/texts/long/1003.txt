It's very unsettling seeing the amount of people that are dying everyday, not only in my own country, but around the world. And that that figure is rising everyday.

How it may affect my family that are elderly and with pre-existing conditions is making me very anxious. I am not able to leave the house that much and do not get much exercise or sunshine. 

It is impacting my ability to go see my friends and go to the gym which is something that I really need to keep my mental health in check and stay sane.
