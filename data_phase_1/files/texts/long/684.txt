While it is weird the my life is 'on hold' I was too busy before, and am grateful for some time out. I am enjoying being with my immediate family, being able to relax, read, sit in the garden. I am learning new skills/hobbies (crochet, sourdough). I recognise that I am privileged because I do not need to worry about our financial situation, we have enough food, and no-one in my immediate family is ill.
In general I am not anxious about the virus. I understand that statistically speaking, I will get the virus, but will survive. I also understand that I am not a statistic!
As a Christian I feel as safe now as I ever did, knowing that God is in control, both of the global situation and indeed of my own personal one.
