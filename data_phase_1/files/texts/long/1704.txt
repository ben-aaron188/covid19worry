I feel a fair amount of anger towards the whole situation as I believe it was very avoidable. However, because of my health and the rest of my family in lockdown, I do not feel a great deal of fear. I do regularly get bored mostly due to the lack of sport on TV which is usually one of my favourite things to watch. But finally, I have felt more relaxed being in lockdown and generally feel happy as I have got to spend more time with my family, and had more time to do hobbies I would not normally do, such as reading.
