I am struggling to keep on top of work at home. I am scared that myself or family may be sick. I hope my friends and distant family are well. I hope I am not bored in the future. I do not have enough opinions on the situation to reach 500 characters I feel this is an unfair amount. I hope that lockdown is over soon however I am enjoying laying in bed longer. The weather is nice which is good. 500 characters is a high demand. I feel sorry for the people that are at risk. I am very thankful for the key workers.
