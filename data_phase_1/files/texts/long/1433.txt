We don’t know when it’s going to end and what the economy is going to end up like in the future. Deaths are continuing to rise so it’s slightly worrying incase a family member or friend will catch the virus and be extremely ill. I’m currently in a situation where I have no job and have no idea when I next will be earning any money to plan future plans and actually go and do activities. Me and my girlfriend were travelling when the virus started so we have no idea if we will ever get to continue with our trip or will we forever be angry because of the corona virus.
