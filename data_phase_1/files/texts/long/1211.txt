I feel anxious as I don’t want any loved ones to catch this virus. I’m worried about my children missing school, I’m worried my partner takes this virus and can’t work, or I get it and can’t care for my children. Also not seeing grandparents is very hard for young children and watching the figures rise in my country and around the world is devastating. Also you feel anxious when you do have to go out as you never know who has this virus, and you hear now of more cases closer to home and actual people you know now having symptoms
