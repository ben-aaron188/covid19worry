I am worried that it’ll effect my family. I am not that worried for me but for my older family members. I like how it has bought the country together and bought out the good in each other. 
I work in the NHS but I am still happy to go into work. Everyone is very supportive and helpful both at work and at home in the community. Staying home is hard but it is the right thing to do and shouldn’t be for too long hopefully. I am thankful for the hour exercise a day to get my 18 month son out of our flat.
