Frustrated but extremely consoled everyone is in the same position. Worried for those vulnerable and my loved ones especially. Feeling very isolated and very restless, getting incredibly bored and overwhelmed. I am Bothered by not being able to go outside and I am missing my friends and family however I am glad to be isolated with someone i can talk to and have fun with, with plenty of work, o be doing as well as studying and being fortunate enough to have plenty of entertainment and space to spend time by myself indulging hobbies
