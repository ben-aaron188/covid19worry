i am very anxious about the corona virus situation and very frustrated when i see so many people disregarding advice out congretating and enjoying the sunshine. i feel angry that people are acting this way when others like myself are following the guidelines. Their irresponsible behaviour will affect us all and make the situation worse and last for much longer than is necessary. I am very worried anout my elderly relatives and keeping them safe will get harder as the situation lasts longer than it should. i think my country should be on total lockdown for longer for quanartine situation to be effective.
