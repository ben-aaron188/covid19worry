I feel really stressed. My sister is an A+ E doctor and I’m so worried about her. She doesn’t have enough ppe. I’m worried about my parents - they have existing health conditions. I’m worried about my employment prospects. I’m a musician and everything is shut. I’m looking at stacking shelves. I feel that the government responded too late and too little. This makes me very angry. I’m not sleeping very well, I’m often awake in the middle of the night for hours. This is also really stressful. I can appreciate that my husband and son are very stressed right now.
