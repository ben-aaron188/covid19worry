Feel worried and scared for the future. It's good that the numbers are going down, but don't understand how we can then go back to normal without it returning? Feel I need to do more to help as I have been furloughed so have the time but then I also lack in motivation with just doing things at home. But that is not new for me. I feel lucky that we have a garden to go in and feel bad for those confined to small spaces and those on their own. 
Fingers crossed the numbers continue to go down and we can overcome this.
