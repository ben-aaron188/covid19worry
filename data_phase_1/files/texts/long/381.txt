I feel that I am happy to stay at home on my even as a senior citizen. I feel sad for the people that have lost loved ones. I feel anger that this dam virus is so rampant and to find a cure or a stability goal seems a million miles away. The financial state of all countries will be disastrous and I feel it will never level in my life time.

Some of the human beings are so ignorant not taking any notice of the warnings and taking this whole thing seriously. Why do they not realise to spread this virus is so easy. It is like a cancer to the whole world.
