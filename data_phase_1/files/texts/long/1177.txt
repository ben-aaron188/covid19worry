I hope that the situation will be resolve soon, and that the impact on the economy will not be too long lasting. I hope that I won't catch the virus myself, even if I don't belong to any group particularly at risk. I hope that there won't be multiple more waves of contamination after that one. I hope that Boris Johnson will be healed quickly and will be able to lead us out of that crisis. I'm also curious of how things will pan out in countries like Sweden where the isolation rules are less strict.
