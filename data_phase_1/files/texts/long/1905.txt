Sad for the people going through loss and hoping for this to all finish as i slightly feel trapped having to stay in. There’s a bit of anxiety for myself and family that sometimes have to leave the house. There’s also a feeling of relaxation from being constantly on the go usually from work and life so now having the time to relax and not be rushing around feels good. There’s also a sense of confusion of what exactly is going out there and a lit bit of anger that it feels like the government isn’t doing much to reduce the situation
