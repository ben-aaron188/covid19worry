anxious about catching it am in self isolation being in an at risk group.  Son does not have a job having given it up to do A levels - now will not be graded (he is 24) and therefore will not get into university.  He is at home.
My husband is negotiating his pay cut with his employer - he is merchant navy and does not qualify for government help.  I cannot earn as i am isolating.
Hoping all is well for our 4 tenants, would want to help if trouble is ahead.
If I die insurances will cover a lot of our current borrowings.
My/our main concern is cash flow and the worst case scenario - how long?
