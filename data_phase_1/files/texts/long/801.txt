I am feeling frustrated and disgusted at those who aren't still taking social distancing measures seriously. The Government is advising people stay at home for a reason. It makes me angry that those same selfish people will be the ones who unnecessarily exhaust NHS staff more because they didn't adhere to the rules. 
I feel upset that NHS staff are working 13 hour shifts, it isn't right in such a demanding and dangerous situation. 
I feel anxious about completing my own work as the adaptation to a lack of structure and purpose in what I do is disheartening.
