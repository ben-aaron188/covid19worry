I am worried it will delay my summer plans. As of right now I am sad to see so many people breaking the rules set by the government. It is extremely emotional to see people lose members of their family due to the virus. I am proud of our healthcare workers for the hard work they are putting in whilst i am also grateful for out other essential workers. At this very moment, I am tired and stressed. I am fed up of constantly being at home but I understand why I am here. It frustrates me how much the news constantly repeat themselves and NEVER have anything positive to say. This is a worrying time but the news and TV do not help peoples emotions and worries by constantly being negative.
