I feel worried about myself, family or friends catching covid and what that would mean. I also feel angry about selfish individuals who are not being considerate in their behaviour. I worry about the impact on hospitals and all aspects of how this will affect the world in the future. Despite knowing it will be I can’t see a time when this will be over and we’ll be allowed to return to ‘normal’ life. I also can’t begin to think what ‘normal’ will be going forward. I am trying to stay calm, stay safe and stay hopeful.
