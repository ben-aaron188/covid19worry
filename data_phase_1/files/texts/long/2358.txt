The total numbers are in line with the a rate death rate for respiratory related illnesses eg influenza and so there isn't a pandemic except that there is a pandemic every year. In 2018 there was an even higher rate if death. No pandemic. 
In January 4000 more people passed away than other months. Hospitals coped. 
I'm upset at how people are not getting the correct treatment at hospital as I know people buzzing for help and not being answered to at night.  This is sad. 

We must look at the actual figures which can be found on official government websites. We will understand how to cope with the situation.
