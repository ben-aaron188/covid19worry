I am trying to not think too much about the Corona situation as I will get upset, stressed, worried and sad. Instead I have been focusing on myself and my own needs. I have been practising mindfulness but meditating, exercising and eating healthier foods.

 I can get stressed and worried very easily so this is why it is so important for me to stay emotionally balanced during this uncertain time. I have not been reading the news too much and anything that I need to know I find out on social media which some times gives out good information. I try not to discuss corona with my friends and family as they are a bit too obsessed with the situation.

I am hoping that very soon everything can go back to normal and people can go back to their normal lives as I am a bit tired of working from home as I live with family and it is getting a bit too much
