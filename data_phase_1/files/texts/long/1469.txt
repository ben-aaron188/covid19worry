I'm just worried about my partner who is imunocompromised. Every time I need to dash out for supplies I'm paranoid about catching anything that could affect her. I know if I get it I'll survive, but I'm worried about her.

I'm also annoyed at all the idiots who dont need the social distancing and stay at home measures. They're just going to make it all worse and keep the lockdown in action. 

I want the world to get back to normal, and that will only happen if people follow the advice and do as they're told
