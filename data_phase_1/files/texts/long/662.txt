I feel very annoyed and frustrated.  I am sad people are dying etc but im angry my plans are all cancelled and  i hate the feeling of unknown.  The unknown feeling just makes me feel horrible and like a pit at the bottom of my stomach. Its hard also to describe what is happening to a 1 year old and 3 year old that notice something is different. They just want to go to the park or friends house to play. People who are not following the rules need to have some thing other than a fine as its not working for them and ruins it for the rest of us.
