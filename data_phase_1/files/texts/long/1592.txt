I have mixed emotions:  On the one hand I feel a sense of anxiety because my sister works in the NHS and I am a carer for an elderly gentleman with complex health needs - so I worry that my sister might get it, and I worry that me or my client might get it when we go to the hospital for one of his appointments.  On the other hand, we are currently self-isolating on my client's lovely farm and it is very peaceful and we have lots of space to go outside and exercise - so am I grateful for this space, and I'm also learning how to administer my client's intravenous fluid which will increase my pay significantly, so I am also grateful for the opportunity to increase my skill set and my ability to earn more during this crisis when many people have lost their jobs.
