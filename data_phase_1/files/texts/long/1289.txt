I am concerned by the level that people are not following the guidelines. I am disgusted by yesterday's events from both Nicola Sturgeon and the ex CMO Catherine Calderwood, this was no mistake this twice blatantly flouting the rules,. Now many people in Scotland thinks it is all a hoax. So am anxious as this will prolong the mess now. It is bad enough getting people to be sensible without the so called medical expert being a complete two weekends in the running especially as i live in Fife just along the road from her so called holiday home. She should be fined not warned, the police messed up, shpws one law for them and one law for us
