Annoyed at people not following government advise. Frustrated that there’s nothing I can do to help. Anxious about the future and the impacts it will have, not just on health but the economy etc. Sad and worried about my friends and family I cannot see. Tired as I no longer have routine also mixed with anxiety is making my sleeping pattern all over the place! Bored of finding things to do and doing the same things day in day out. Quite frankly I feel like a chicken who’s been kept in a coupe! I don’t feel optimistic about the future at the moment as I’m finding days and weeks extremely long and am coping with that by just taking one day as it comes.
