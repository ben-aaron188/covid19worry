At first I wasn't too worried as I didn't truly believe I would be affected in any way. As the weeks have gone by (and I have not left my house in over three weeks now) and the death rate is rising daily I find myself not being able to believe how quickly the world has been changed. I am proud that our country is doing what it can but also disappointed in the few who are acting selfishly and not in society's best interest. I don't feel 100% assured the government are doing as much as they can to protect NHS and other essential workers' safety and that, along with the obvious concern of myself or a family member catching the virus, are my main concerns right now.
