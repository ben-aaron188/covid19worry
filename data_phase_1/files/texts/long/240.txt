I am following the government guidelines, and really enjoying being at home and spending time on my hobbies. I am not worried about contracting COVID-19, as I live alone and the only time I see other people is receiving deliveries such as groceries. There is very little pressure on me, so it feels like a nice, relaxing holiday. I feel a sense of freedom being able to sleep as much as I want, decorate my home, and spend time on my hobbies. The changes brought about due to the coronavirus have been positive for me.
