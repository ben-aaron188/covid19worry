Very anxious and fearful. 
I think it’s mainly the fear of the unknown. Will I catch it? Will I die? How long will it go on for. 
There’s so many unknowns 
Very worried for my family members and then my child. She’s the reason we’ve been isolating for the last 3 weeks, to protect her 
It worries me like mad when my husband has to work, as he’s in and out of people’s houses fixing boilers. We’re being very cautious and just taking each day as it comes. 
Hopefully people will listen and stay at home, although we did just go for our daily walk and see a group of teenagers playing football.
