I am relaxed about my own situation; I am financially secure and comfortable. The concerns I have are for those who are vulnerable/struggling. I am hopeful (although not optimistic) that this situation might improve society and move us away from right-wing populist governments. As someone who already spends a large amount of time indoors, the change in lifestyle is not as drastic as it might be for others. The concerns around food and household supplies appear to have eased, although I don't see life getting back to normal until a vaccine can be distributed on mass.
