At this moment, I feel very anxious about how the situation is going to pan out. It also makes me sad that people are not obeying government restrictions and staying indoors to prevent the spread. If everyone did their part we would be able to prevent the spread and have our adventures back again. 

It is hard to know what is going to happen and people have to accept the fact that nothing is known but do their part to stay indoors to prevent the spread. It is a hard time for everyone and everyone's story is different with the crisis. I am very appreciative of all the key workers who are helping out in their field during this pandemic.
