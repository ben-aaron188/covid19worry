Part of me is anxious because I miss being free to go outside and go to places, but I also feel somewhat relaxed because I am fortunate to be in full-time employment and can work from home. I am also enjoying being able to spend more time with my family. I am very busy so cannot fully enjoy the many free leisure activities now available to us!
I am worried in case any of my close family, especially my children or my grandparents, get Covid-19 and what that could mean for us. This would somewhat change how I currently feel about the situation. Although things are bad in general, for my family here we have it relatively good.
