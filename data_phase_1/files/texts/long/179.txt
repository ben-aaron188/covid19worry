i feel worried and scared about not knowing whats going to happen and when all this will end. I am worried about leaving the house for essentials because i dont want to put my family at risk. i will feel alot less worried when the worst is over and an end is in sight, although i fear that things will never return to the normality we once had, this is a very worrying time and causes lots of anxiety for me and my family. its nothing that me or any of my family members have ever experienced in our lifetimes, and somthing i hope never happens again.
