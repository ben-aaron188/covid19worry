UPSETTING TO SEE PATIENTS DYING WITHOUT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BY THEIR SIDES, WORRIED FOR MY OWN FAMILY HEALTH THAT THEY WILL BECOME ILL. I'M  HOPEFUL WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS AS A COUNTRY AND LEARN FROM MISTAKES MADE REGARDING THINGS LIKE BEING PREPARED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN. AMAZED TO SEE COMMUNITY SPIRIT NEIGHBORS COMING TOGETHER ALTHOUGH APART AND GIVING EACH OTHER SUPPORT SHOWS US GOOD HUMANS STILL EXIST AND THIS IS COMFORTING I'M SURE TO SO MANY PEOPLE. MAKES YOU REALIZE HOW LONELY PEOPLE CAN BE AND HOW MENTAL HEALTH IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH
