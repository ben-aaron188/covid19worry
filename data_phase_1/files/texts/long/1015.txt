How I currently feel about the coronavirus is indifference. The virus itself has had no direct impact on my family or myself so I feel quite happy about that. Indirectly it is having a negative impact on my mindset due to no longer being able to work. I feel stressed and anxious over how I will be coming out the other side of this. Will I have to look for a new job? Will I have to work full time despite it impacting my health? Will I still have a roof over my head? Will I be in great debt. This makes me fearful of the future. However, with regards directly to the virus, I do understand it can be deadly but I feel confident that I am going to be ok.
