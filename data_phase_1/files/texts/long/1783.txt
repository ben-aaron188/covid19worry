I feel very sad that this has come and cant wait for my life to return to normal, I hope and prayer that my family all survive this. I feel very sorry for those in the nhs service that have lost their lives helping others. I think some people are being inconsiderate and still breaking the rules put in place to protect the vunrabile and older people, they are still going out and about as if nothing has happened, it is not good for those of us who have obeyed the rules and stayed in, despite missing our families .
