It doesn’t spare anyone. Hospitalisation is the worst. No one knows where you are or what is happening or visit you. That is the scariest part.
And now Boris is in ICU. As if Brexit and Coronavirus weren’t enough. Economy lent down, job losses. Hope he’s better soon. 
Hoping people  are sensible and maintain social distances and contain the virus. 
The Coronavirus has spread throughout the world. Although the family gets time with each other but the rest of the family is spread the world over. So scary times. The best thing is to equip yourself and learn something new and make the most of the time available. Hope the weather stays warm and sunny and then it woo be bearable.
