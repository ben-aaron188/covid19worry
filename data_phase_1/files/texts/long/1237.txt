I am scared that my husband will come into contact with someone who is asymptomatic at the supermarket despite socially distancing himself and will bring it home. I am fearful that we are going to get poorly. 

I am fearful my family will suffer and contract the virus through no fault of their own. Leading them to become ill and become unwell. I fear they might go through all of this alone in a hospital without any of us to hold their hand. It frightens me that so many of our wonderful NHS are falling ill when they're just trying to do their best for us. 

I worry about our family finances and how we will cope financially after all of this. I worry for my children's future and how this will set us back after years of working hard to afford nice things. 

It worries me so much!
