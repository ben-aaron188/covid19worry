I feel somewhat anxiety towards the whole corona situation. When I leave to buy essentials I take caution not to touch surfaces and keep contact away from individuals. 

I have not found it entirely difficult to stay indoors despite sometimes feeling a little bored. 
I feel that the government should implement more harsh measures into enforcing rules and regulations regarding covid19. I also feel that it is everyone's responsibility to do their bit in ensuring the safety of others and the community.
