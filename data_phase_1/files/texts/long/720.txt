I'm incredibly scared of the whole situation and of those who aren't taking it seriously. Im worried that ill lose people in my life from it and im angry at the fact that my goverment has done next to nothing to help essential workers. Im scared for the people who work at hospitals and who are putting their lives and thta of their families at incredible risk. We should have been more prepared. Im disgusted at the companies who are attempting to stay open and futher risk their workers. Im also disgusted at the fact these companies ""higher ups"" dont have to work around people and can ""work from home"". If they expect others to risk their lives, they should be doing the same
