I am currently feeling a lot of emotions with the coronavirus. In base of the situation, I am disgusted in China being responsible for yet another virus. I do not blame Chinese citizens, who are the victims of their own government, I blame the government's irresponsible handling of not continuing to ban specific market practices. This is yet another situation where China failed to fix a problem; in the past proclaimed that these markets are banned, yet it's blatant that they have not been with this virus occurring. In response to the virus, I am disgusted WHO is backing China when refusing to oppose pro-CCP sensitive questions, and possibly manipulating statistics. The victims of this situation will die in cases beyond the virus, where vulnerable populations will be hurt, once again, due to irresponsibility. I am sickened by thinking of the world post-Covid19. All those with lost jobs, regulations being placed when nobodies paying attention, increase of poverty and wealth displacement. There's too many thoughts and feelings, though sadness and repulsion seem to be the easiest way to define how I feel.
