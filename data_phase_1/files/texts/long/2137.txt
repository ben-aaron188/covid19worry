Very worried for certain elderly and compromised relatives. Can’t see a good ending to this. I’m fearful that elderly relatives will need to stay in isolation for many months to come until a vaccination has been developed and don’t know how they’ll be able to stay inside for so long.   Anxious about getting enough supplies when supermarkets are struggling to keep their shelves stocked. Can’t see an acceptable way forward because as soon as restrictions are lifted the virus will pass to the vulnerable. Anxiety that the fabric of society is disintegrating.
