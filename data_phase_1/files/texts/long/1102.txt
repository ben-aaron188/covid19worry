Worried about the amount of people who will die from this. I am also worried as I am emotional eater and obviously going to the shops is much harder. I'm struggling to keep going. I'm worried for particular family members about their health and am trying my best to keep everyone healthy. I am also worried about my university exams as everything in my final year has now been cancelled and changed, it all feels very strange. I constantly feel like I'm on edge and my tummy feels weird. I feel a little bit more chilled in another way as there is no more pressure to socialise or anything and I find that I am anxious a lot to see people anyway, now I dont have that pressure or have to make up excuses to friends.
