I am anxious about the virus. I'm nervous for my friends and family but also feel uneasy for other people I do not know, especially those in a vulnerable category.

I am bored and finding it hard to motivate myself. I'm trying to engage in daily exercise but feel that this is frowned upon by others even though its within govt guidance. This puts me off daily outdoor exercise. 

I live in London but was due to return to Belfast on Thursday to celebrate the Easter holidays. This is not going ahead and therefore I feel sad that I won't see my family.
