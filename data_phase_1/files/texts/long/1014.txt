I am, primarily, angry that the economy is being put ahead of society,at this moment and that years and years of doing so has also left the NHS short of resources to cope.

I am afraid, and worried, that the decisions made at the top will sacrifice lives to protect ""the city"".

On a more personal level, at the moment I am relaxed and content as I am making good use of the additional time I have and am getting to spend more time with my family. There is the underlying fear that any of us could yet get very ill/die.
