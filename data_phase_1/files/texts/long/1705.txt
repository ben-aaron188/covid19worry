I feel ok really, the numbers of people dying seem to be coming down. 
City’s and big town’s obviously have the most infected. 
I don’t know anyone personally who has been tested and has the virus. 
I do think the country might wasn’t really quick enough to lock down as it was obvious what was happening in other countries. Air travel should be halted completely unless it’s for medical supplies/ Curriers.
Lessons need to be learnt for the future stockpile PPE, etc etc NHS needs major funding and a huge shakeup of management.
