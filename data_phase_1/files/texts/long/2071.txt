The strongest feeling I have about the Corona situation is acceptance. I am helpless to do anything about it so must make the best of the situation by staying inside and trying to do productive activities. I hope it will be over soon to get back to daily life and my university although I am not hopeful of this. There is some frustration that I cannot do the things I want to do such as going to the pub or meeting up with friends but I am not tempted to do this as I am worried stricter social distancing measures such as a complete ban on exercise being implemented if people do not follow the correct advice.
