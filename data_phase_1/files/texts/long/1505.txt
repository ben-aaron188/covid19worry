Feeling very worried about the future, how it will affect all of our lives going forward and whether a vaccine will be found. Feel sad and anxious to be living like this and hate not having freedom. Makes me feel depressed and bored and frustrated. Worried about my children and finances and how we will manage. Worried about me and my family becoming poorly and how that could end up being catastrophic. I can't stop watching the news and analysing figures and statistics. Waiting for daily totals to come out each day to see where we're at with it all. A very stressful and anxious time.
