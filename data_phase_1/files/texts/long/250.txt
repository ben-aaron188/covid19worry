I'm missing human interaction, going out and doing things. I've tried to tackle this by video calling friends. I've struggled to stick to a routine and keeping my work productivity. So i'm hoping this doesn't last long as i dont want a long lasting effect at work for when the offices open again. 

I've also had periods of very immense sadness. Being alone has created too much time for me to sink into a depressive mood, but it's also allowing me time to work on this.

I don't think the news is being helpful in reporting the news everyday. I think this is only creating more anxiety where hope and positivity should be spread.
