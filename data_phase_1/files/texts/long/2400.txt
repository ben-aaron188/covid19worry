I feel very angry, mostly at the Chinese government for letting this happen. I’m also very anxious as I’m in a different country to my family and I don’t know when I’ll see them again. I’m just waiting for the day when this is all over.

At this time of writing, the prime minister is in intensive care and this only adds to my worry. I have underlying health conditions so I’m being very careful but I’m also adamant to get my outdoor exercise in daily.

I’m working from home currently which is challenging but define achievable.
