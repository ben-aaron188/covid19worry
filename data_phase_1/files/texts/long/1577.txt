In Answer to the previous question I expressed a level of anger and disgust. This was not to the disease or how how it is being addressed by national or local government or those responsible for treating individuals, the medical services etc. I am angry and disgusted with individuals who are using this situation to either profit from the misfortunes of others or who believe they have carte blanche to do whatever they want and everyone else can suffer. 
I have no direct fear of the virus itself or of the disease. Although I understand it is highly contagious and potentially very serious, all I can do is follow the guidelines for keeping myself and my family and friends safe.
