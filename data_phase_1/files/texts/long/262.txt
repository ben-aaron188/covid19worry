Worried, for my family as there seems no vaccine will be about soon and it is just a matter of time, even with social distancing and lockdown, before we all get infected.  Also slightly more worried as I work in a supermarket, so I am potentially more likely do be exposed.
The world situation does not seem to be getting any better so I do not think this will go away any time soon and will have a long lasting effect on all of our lives. I do believe the Government is doing the right thing and everyone should adhere to their instructions.
