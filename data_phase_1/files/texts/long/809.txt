Currently, I feel hopeless about the Corona situation. I had previously been staying positive but this week I have been feeling a mix of strong feelings like anxiety and sadness. I am finding it quite unsettling to have no control over the situation, especially knowing other people are still willingly putting others at risk. Since losing my job last week due to this situation, I feel useless and am sad that there is nothing to look forward to in the near future. I am trying to stay positive and keep some sort of routine throughout my days so that I don't feel lost in the uncertainty of all of this.
