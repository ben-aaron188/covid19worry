I feel tired, tired of life, tired of wondering if I will die, angry at the Chinese for this, angry that they only admitted a problem because they had too, angry that they eat rubbish because their government doesn't care, angry that once this is over they will still do the same, angry that life will never ever be the same. Angry that I'm off work, no money, no idea if I'll have a job at the end of all this, angry at idiots who try to exploit the system, people who selfishly hog all the food. Why has my life expectancy be shortened massively over China, why as an island are we not safe, why do we let these people in to ruin our very existence.
