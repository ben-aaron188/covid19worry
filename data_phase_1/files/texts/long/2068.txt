I feel very upset and uncertain during these periods as I am unsure what will happen to both myself and my family it is a scary time for everyone with this virus not taking any prisoners it seems to be going round like wildfire and we are unable to prevent it the best we can do is try and flatten the curve. If everyone follows the government guidelines this will help us to defeat the virus as early as we possible can but if people keep ignoring this it will be extremely hard for us to ever shift this virus
