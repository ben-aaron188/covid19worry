Nervous and worried,for the future but also hoping for the best, the world might look a little different afterwards but will mostly be the same. Working from home is an unexpected bonus, that makes life easier knowing you are able to stay at home and avoid the virus.
Things look to be heading the right way in the UK at least, so I don't think it will be too long before things go back to 'normal'. Hopefully the death rate decreases in the following days and lockdown measures can be relaxed. Hopefully the virus can be stopped permanently with a vaccine and we won't have to live in a world where this is the new normal.
