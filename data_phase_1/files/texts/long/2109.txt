I don't feel actively stressed and scared all the time, possibly because I spent my early teens watching films with a similar premise (pandemic, disasters, nuclear war etc.) and had perhaps already reached placed of acceptance before it even began. That said, I'm exhausted from the past few years and I'm definitely noticing it more with less to distract me. I do feel more relaxed than I did before this situation began, though, because I can rest in a way I couldn't then. I think I feel a bit frustrated with other people who aren't putting the effort in - I've been in my house since my activities & classes were cancelled the week before the lockdown was put in place, and people are still ignoring the guidance to stay in and stay apart. If it gets made compulsory, they'll only just be starting to be stuck indoors while I'll have been doing it for weeks already. I'm a bit angry that people aren't caring enough about others to just stay in for a bit.
