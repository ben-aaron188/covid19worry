I am very nervous about the heath of my family and results of my exams which have been cancelled due to the virus. However I am not worried about my own heath due to the virus as I am young.
Furthermore I am frustrated at the quarantine not being followed in the UK as it is increasing the odds of outside activities such as running being cancelled. This is as the only positive from the virus I have experienced is having the time and lack of distraction to get fit. As a result if outdoor activities are banned I would be rate the prior scales 8/10 or above for anger and anxiety.
