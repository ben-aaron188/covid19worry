I feel frustrated that this situation has caused us all to have to sacrifice our freedom in only being able to leave home under certain circumstances. I also feel very anxious about my future job security and anticipate long term economic affects from this situation. I feel more concerned about that than I do the health implications of Coronavirus, although I am concerned about contracting the virus and passing it onto my wife, who's health I am worried about more than my own. I also feel quite frustrated at not being able to see my relatives.
