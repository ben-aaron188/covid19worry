I feel uncertain. There is the potential for things to be much worse if people don't follow guidelines and guidance. I expect I will feel even more negative if and when someone I personally know becomes affected. I like to go on my daily exercise and I will be disappointed if this is taken from me due to the ignorance and arrogance of others. I watch each day's briefing and keep up with the daily figures but I try not to look too much into things as it just makes me more anxious. I feel for people who have less stable jobs than myself (or who are unable to work from home) as they will suffer more severe financial consequences than I. I am lucky that I have a supportive family to support me in these times even though I am sad I am unable to see my girlfriend.
