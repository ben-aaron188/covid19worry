I feel sad for the loss of life and the pain that causes families. Given the current figures based against the normal loss of life we have as a nation each day I feel confident we are getting out of a bad patch now. 
Hundreds of people die every day from various illnesses etc of various ages and most of it goes unreported. Obviously 5000 people is a huge loss. I feel positive this is nearing the end. It's a bit of a worry to see how fast a virus can spread globally though. It's been good to see people helping each other.
