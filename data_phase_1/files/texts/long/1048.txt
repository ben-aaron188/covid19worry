I'm scared for my family, my friends, for my job. For my self-worth and those of others around me. Scared my company will go under. Angry that not enough has been done to keep peeople safe. Furious that NHS workers are like lambs to the slaughter.
Worried I'm not doing enough. Concerned that my allergies are the virus taking hold, but knowing this is irrational. 
Will I ever see my parents or grandparents again? Will the virus take someone that I love?
When will I go back to work> Will I have a job that i can go back to? Am I being selfish>
