At first I was watching the news thinking wow this is some disease spreading across china, then when it started to move to Europe I took more notice. When it hit the UK i became scared, but when the advice to stay at home was given that was frightening.

I feel anxious and nervous for the rest of my family hoping they stay safe and well and I miss seeing them, and i hate that my sister lives so close but I can go and see her. I am not angry because I feel the government have done as much as they can to help keep us safe. I wish more people would take notice of the advice.

I try to watch the news just once per day now, because it can become overwhelming
