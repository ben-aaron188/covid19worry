It's very sad to see the numbers of death growing each day due to this virus especially as we can see so many people not respecting the social distancing rule and to stay home the maximum they can when some workers ( ie : doctors , nurses , any healthcare specialists ) as so much risk to caught it and potentially die of it or having to lock down themselves too when for some they got they own family to protect from the corona virus. It's not been a great start of the year so far and definitely a first and hopefully last. Nothing and nobody could have prepare anyone for this. On top of that here in UK so so many people lost their jobs due to it and even the potential 80% of pay to come it will be hard to make it financially
