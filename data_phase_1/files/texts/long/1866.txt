I am not worried about it. I am pretty sure I already had it about six weeks ago. I had a temperature and persistent coughing for just over two weeks. I'm pretty sure that was the Corona virus  I am completely recovered now. I will have the Antibody test when it becomes widely available to see if I really did actually had it ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
