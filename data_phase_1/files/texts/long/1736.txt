im worried about the amount of people who will get it. also worried about myself and fanily being affected. the lockdown is also very boring and its hard to find things to do. the longer it goes on the more boring it will be, but its important to protect everyone. i also hope the ecomomey can recover very quickly afterwords and that too many people dont suffer as a result. its a very trying and difficult time for everyone. i just hope that everything turns out ok and it doesnt drag on for ages and ages
