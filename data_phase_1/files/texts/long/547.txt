Mostly I'm sad cause of the individuals not following the rules. Stay home. Save nhs. Save lifes. Couple of trips to the shops, parks are not worth it. They might be young and healthy but unfold it is nit about us anymore. It is about others. We need to protect older people and those with health conditions. Its so easy. Do not go outside. Virus can nkt move. People can transfer virus. Do not travel. Do not overstay anywhere. Maximum one hour of fresh air and walking it is ebough. The more people stay home now the quickest we can all go outside
