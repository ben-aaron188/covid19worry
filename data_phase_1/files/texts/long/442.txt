It would be naive not to feel anxiety or fear in the current situation, however, I am trying to see the positives in the situation - it is not one that we have any control over, beyond following the rules that have been put in place to protect us. As a teacher, I am continuing to work, but sad and devastating though the situation is, I am on a personal level, able to feel calmer at the new, slower pace of life, and enjoy the extra time at home with my children and husband. Time is definitely precious and often goes by without being fully appreciated.
