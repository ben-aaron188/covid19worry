At the moment I am feeling quite anxious about the situation. 
It seems that figures may be improving slightly but the next day its worse again. Newspaper headlines, twitter etc dont really help as they know that dramatic headlines sell news and they use a  mixture of trigger words to cerate the desired effect rather than actual facts at times. I live in Scotland so I have the extra anxiety of being under the whim of a partisan power crazy leader and her cohort of inexperinced and underqualified ""health leaders"" . Quite a few scots are now ignoring her Scottishing and regurgetation of information, and listening to the main UK daily press briefing insead. Scots people are definte;y more fearful as a result of her separate approach. We need unity at atime like this. The CMO scandal has just made things so much worse.
