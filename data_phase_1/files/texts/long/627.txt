I feel anxious but also optimistic about the current Coronavirus situation. I feel anxious as I am worried about people close to me but I am also optimistic that if we all stay indoors we can fight this together. I also feel a bit sad that we have no normality but again I feel hopeful that we'll be able to get through this and life will resume as normal. It does make me sad hearing about all the deaths from the virus adding to the fear but again I think the UK and the world will get through this together.
