Angry at the government for the propaganda and trying to defend decisions they made that were wrong - they should just say they got it wrong.  They should not be politicising this. Hopeful that people are trying so hard to help, the health service workers, teachers etc.  Worried about getting it as I have asthma and I don't want to make my kids worry about  me.  Worried about the future for job prospects, education, finances.   Hopeful that this could bring about social change once we get through it. Glad that my mum died recently so doesn't have to go through this. Concerned about how I will cope getting back to normal when this is all over.
