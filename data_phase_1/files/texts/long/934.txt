I am quite shut off from it so not too worried about the immediate concerns. However feel worried about my plans for the future because of it e.g. graduating. And i feel quite saddened with so many people dying without loved ones near, but feel proud and hopeful as to how people have dealt with this and how it is bringing people together. Feel scared and angry about the nhs not having enough ppe and lack of testing, am worried of how this may affect healthcare. And am feeling anxious and a bit lonely missing seeing my friends, being social and going to do activities with others or just being able to get out of the house more. Also feel lucky and grateful that i am in a good situation, as i am healthy and live in the country with my family where i have lots of access to the outdoors and fresh air unlike others and i have also not been affected income wise.
