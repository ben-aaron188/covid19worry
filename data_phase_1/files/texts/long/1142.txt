I am very stressed about the situation. My main concerns are the way it effects work initially as that provides day to day stress. I am also concerned about my family and making sure they are all provided for and that my extended family is looked after. I am concerned that people I know may get sick and in the worst cases die, and I am scared of losing someone close to me. I am also bored when I am at home and stuck in the house, and upset that I canâ€™t take my daughter out anywhere that she would normally enjoy, and angry at the people who are clearly not following the government advice
