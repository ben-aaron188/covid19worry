Currently I am frustrated that I cannot go out and do the things I would like to do. I of course completely understand the reasoning and thats fine but I cannot help but feel slightly trapped. Also I am worried for my American friends, as the healthcare system there probably cannot even be  called a system. I am also nervous for others that I know that are more vulnerable. If I get it, I do not care, I will be fine, but if they get it, I cannot be sure what will happen. That is the part that scares me.
