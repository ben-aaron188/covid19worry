It's quite up and down at the moment. Right this second, I feel quite relaxed. I've had a productive day studying and have made good progress on my thesis (which I've been neglecting lately because I've spent too much time at work). I'm now halfway through War and Peace, which I've been tackling for over 2 years and now finally have time to actually read properly. I even had time to indulge in some crafts today. This has been an opportunity for me to pause and relax- I'm normally an anxious person so this has been like a reset button
