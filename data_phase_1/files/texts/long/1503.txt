Sick of being stuck indoors because idiotic people cannot follow simple rules. Worried because my mum is still going to work and that she might catch the virus. Absolutely fed up of being at home with nothing to do and not being able to see anyone. Lost my job and sick and tired of having no purpose at the moment when I wake up of a morning. Annoyed that people are still venturing out and not social distancing which means this will just drag on even longer! The PM needs to fully lock the country down and he should be hanging out massive fines for people breaking the rules. Not a measly 30 quid fine. Nobody will listen until more strict rules are enforced.
