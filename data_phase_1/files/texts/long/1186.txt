I currently feel quite relaxed but also slightly frustrated that I have restrictions on where I go and that some places are closed due to the current situation. Although I feel empathetic to the situation as I know that lock down procedures like this are necessary for the greater good of the community. I feel I can use this time to extend my creativity and spend time doing things which I could not previously do. The availability of this time I feel I should be using as efficiently as possible trying to do what I enjoy most with people around me like family.
