Very angry at people who are still going out and not social distancing from others. Nervous and anxious about whatâ€™s to come and when this will end.  I feel very isolated being at home constantly like very trapped. Feel very distant from everyone and miss having freedom of being able to do things that I like such as the gym. Proud to be from the UK and having just amazing NHS workers. At this minute, I am very bored and I have ran out of activities to do and I am spending mad amount of time on my phone.
