I hate being stuck in the house without the option to go out and socialise or browse the shops. I feel trapped and frustrated because we have no end date. I’m hating working from home and not being able to interact with my colleagues as normal, we are a very close team and we are all missing each other. The uncertainty is very upsetting and causes me anxiety to an extent. It’s hard work having to work from home normal hours then not be able to have any sort of social release on the weekends, it makes working just that bit less rewarding as there’s nothing to relax and let your hair down doing when you have finished the working week.
