I feel angry seeing and hearing all the people who are still going out and about every day without a care in the world, I feel angry at them because I feel they don't care about the situation at all. Why is it so hard to just stay home?! 
I feel sad and anxious listening and reading news about so many deaths every day, it's making me sad and worried about me and my family, especially my mother who's got cancer so she's in a high risk group. 
World had been turned upside down and I'm fearing of everyone. 
I worry about family's, my friends, NHS and all the key workers.
