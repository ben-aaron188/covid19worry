Its extremely scary as it seems to get worse by the day. the quarantine is making me feel very sad and detached from my friends. its frightening, and provokes my anxiety. I'm frustrated that people are not taking the situation seriously and this worries me too, especially with the mind set some people have; they think they are invincible to the coronavirus and this puts many people at risk. I feel very unsafe in the current climate as the coronavirus has no cure and the death rate is currently very high within the UK.
