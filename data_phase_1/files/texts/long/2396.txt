it is disturbing, there is a lot of uncertainty which brings anxiety, I feel stressed because of many changes that had to be made. I'm anxious, a bit afraid, worried about other people, and I feel guilty that I'm not being able to help, like doctors help. I'm slightly uncomfortable because of the inconveniences but at the same time, leaving everything behind and going back home makes me feel happy, i get to take a step back and relax, my feelings are taken seriously whether caused by pandemic or not, I am extremely relieved to be able to take a break as everything stops, even though having to leave a lot of things behind was extremely stressful. but it forces us to take a moment and really take care of ourselves.
