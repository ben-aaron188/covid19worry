I have a state of constant anxiety because of the epidemic.
I constantly worry about my parents.
I am afraid of losing my savings.
I very worry about my work. I may lose my job because of this epidemic.
I am afraid our medical system may not cope with many patients
This outbreak situation is of great concern to me. Many of my friends have lost their jobs. The government is not helping. The money is running out. In the shops queue. Food is running out. 
But I hope the situation will change for the better soon. And we will return to our old life
