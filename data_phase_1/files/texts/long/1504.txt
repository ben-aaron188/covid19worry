Feeling quite depressed and down. Too much time on my hand to think so thinking and worrying about the future in terms of financial stability...managing the family and being able to do the things which were planned for this year such as purchasing house...having another a baby. Also worrying about losing loved ones and not knowing how long this is going to go on for. Stressed with kids and husband at home...donâ€™t know what to cook for meals...kids not sticking to routine and structure so the days are all over the place!
