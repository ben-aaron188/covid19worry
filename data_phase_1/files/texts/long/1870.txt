i feel that the governments of the world are not doing enough to try and contain the virus which is frustrating.

i am personally happy as i prepared for this event so i don't have as much to worry about as the people who were oblivious and didn't prepare for it.

i have enough supplies to last a few months therefore i have a sense of clam and am relaxed as i do not have anything to worry about currently and for the foreseeable future.

also i was working from home before the lockdown in my country so not much has changed for me.
