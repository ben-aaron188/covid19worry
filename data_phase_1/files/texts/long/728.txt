I am worried about people who still have to work, especially those in the healthcare sector. I am concerned that they are not being given enough protection by the government and/or their employees. I am worried about my immediate family, I have parents in their 60s with health issues and a grandparent in her 90s. I am worried about my children and how the lockdown is affecting them as I don't live with either if them and I'm sad because I haven't seen them for months as it is. I am worried about my finances and that others will also be struggling. I am also worried about the long term impact on smaller businesses and am concerned about a lack of competition after the lockdown and what that will do to prices. I am however hopeful that we will get through this and that people will see we all need to look our for one another and that we need ro invest more in the NHS and be more appreciative of ""low skill"" jobs which many are relying on now.
