I feel very angry that some people are not following the rules, they are visiting neighbours etc and bragging about it on facebook and I am disgusted by their selfishness. I am missing people during the lockdown and am being sensible and responsible by staying inside and not seeing anyone, but others who are not being sensible are making it last longer and making it worse for everyone and I think they are incredibly selfish and it makes me very angry. I feel sad that I cannot see people and very anxious and depressed.
