I think that at the start it was not taken seriously enough by everyone, including me. We still know very little about the virus and dont know what it is capable of. It has brought out the kindness in most people but the very selfishness of others, with the attitude of many being ""I wont get it"" or ""I'm young, I'll survive it"", forgetting that this attitude will affect their lives, their friends lives and their families lives. So although most people are staying at home and protecting the NHS and themselves, it doesnt mean that they wont catch it through the attitudes of people like I've described above. That is the thing that most scares me. I can do all I can, but is everybody else?
