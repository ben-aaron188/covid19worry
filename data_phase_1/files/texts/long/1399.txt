I’m very anxious about the current situation. I want to see if the lockdown has had any effect in reducing the number of cases and deaths, but don’t want to get my hopes up yet. It isn’t clear if the day on day reductions will lead to any actual trend, and I’m not sure when we would expect to know if the measures have worked. I think that people are getting fed up with the lockdown and there will be increasing civil disorder if the situation doesn’t seem to be improving. On the other hand, I’m truly horrified by the authoritarian streak that has been revealed in many people, and am disgusted at the way that rather than promoting community understanding some individuals are calling for people to be shot in the street for going for a walk. I’m looking forward to when I don’t have to work from home any more and I can do normal things like see my sister and my mum, and my friends.
