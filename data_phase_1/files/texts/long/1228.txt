Worried about my friend and family as my dad has been classed as at risk because he has heart problem also cancer in the past and my 7 year old daughter suffers from asthma. Worried about the situation at work as a lot of people could die if someone gets corona virus as I work in a care home and a lot of the residents are all ready suffering from lots of problems. I starting to feel a bit trapped and my children are started to get agitated with being in doors all the time. and everyone is started to get annoyed and frustrated with each other.
