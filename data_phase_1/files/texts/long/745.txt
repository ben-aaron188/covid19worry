Apprehensive about the future in every way, eg. Work, economy, 
Cost of living and wellbeing. Fear about the situation and great anxiety, which i have felt for sometime now. By this I mean about what is happening in relation to this situation and how it is being handled. My main worry is not being able to access health care as we normally know it, if needed. The risk of going outdoors even to shop for essentials is a concern, but necessary as it is difficult to find available slots with supermarkets.  some people are not taking it seriously and people with symptoms are even carrying on as usual. This is sadly putting the eternal public at risk.  Not knowing when things will begin to improve and get better, will it be weeks or months. This is completely the unknown and very frightening.
