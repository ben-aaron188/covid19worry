I feel overwhelmed by the constant news and inconsistent advice. I have family and close friends in different countries - here in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, the US, Singapore, Japan and Canada - and everyone seems to be treating it completely differently and have completely different restrictions in their daily lives. I am worried about the long term economic implications and how that will impact people's lives, just as the austerity that followed the 2008 financial crisis caused huge suffering and reduced life expectancy for many. I am frustrated at people I see not following the restrictions in place. Sacrifice doesn't feel fair if some people make exceptions for themselves.
