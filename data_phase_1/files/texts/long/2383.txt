I am really scared. What if I get infected and infect my family. What if I or my family can't deal with it and die. What if we are really ill and all alone. Is it better to get it and hope to recover and get some immunity. Will life ever be the same again. What will happen to my children if myself and my husband die. What about if my child gets ill. Will I be able to be with him. When will this all be over. When will someone create a vaccine. How many people that I know will die. Will my parents survive this.
