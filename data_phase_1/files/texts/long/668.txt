The situation at the moment still seems slightly hopeless. I struggle to see a clear way out of it that doesn't end with huge amount of deaths and a decimated global economy. Even if we do get through this we'll be paying back for years, with potentially decades of austerity measures. Obviously human life and health comes first though. I feel a bit sad and angry that more wasn't done sooner by governments to combat the spread, as they were equipped with more than enough evidence. But i mainly feel anxious, scared for my family, and completely unmotivated to do anything.
