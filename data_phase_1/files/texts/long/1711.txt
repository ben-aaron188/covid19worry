I'm sure my anxiety levels are significantly higher that usual. I know someone who is being treated at the moment and it could go either way so this is upsetting me and my sleep has been interrupted, When I watch the news or speak to a friend or family member it is the main or often the only subject of the conversation so the focus is on Coronavirus pretty much all the time. I find the best time of the day currently is when I go for a walk as my daily exercise opportunity. Although the social distancing measures make that seem a little strange as well when you have keep at two metres away from people you actually know, should you see them.
