I feel anxious that I, or someone close to me will be seriously harmed due to coronavirus. I feel angry at others ignoring social distancing rules. I feel anxiety over the uncertainty of the current lockdown. I have been surprised at how I have enjoyed spending time at home though, getting to see my partner and pet more often and working from home has sometimes been more enjoyable than being in an office setting although the lack of choice in the matter is frustrating. Social media has been difficult to use in these times as many people are taking to their profiles to rant and scare monger theories which I don’t think helps the situation. It’s important for me to stay realistic in my mindset to reduce any anxiety I have.
