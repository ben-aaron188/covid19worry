Whilst I am sure the Govenment is doing it's utmost best, with Boris Johnson being in hospital the country must be worried.  People who do not stay at home and follow the rules (not guidelines) are very selfish.  We all need to work together to beat it, or we will be back to square one when the rules are relaxed.  I am lucky as I have a garden, and a dog who needs an hour's walk each day, but am missing seeing my elderly Mum and other close relations.  What is annoying me is other people down my road not following the rules.
