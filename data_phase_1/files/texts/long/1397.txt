I feel proud of how quickly we have all adapted to our new way of life. I feel angry at those who think that quarantine rules do not apply to them - they are putting all of our lives in danger. I'm worried for myself & my family, I just want to make sure my loved ones will be okay. Like most people, I am close to some of those that are within the vulnerable groups. The ship is sinking, but all of mankind are in the same boat, so I am anxious but not overly afraid. I am still working, as are my parents, and I know that our jobs aren't 'essential'. It feels as if the government aren't putting in a full 'lockdown' in order to prevent the economy crashing and keep our online businesses going. I am one of the naive ones that put my work first, so I am going into work 5 days a week regardless of the deadly disease. 

My main emotions are anxiety & missing my family.
