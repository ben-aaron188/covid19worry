Im not so worried that i will get the virus my big worry is that as a sufferer of borderline personality disorder, dissociative identity disorder, anxiety and depression and being confined to a small room im cut off from my support network and fear i will never recover from the mental cost. I do have a few friends that are immundo suppressed but they are completely isolating so im not really worried about them.
I feel on the whole as a country we will get through the crisis eventually and recover from its effects eventually.
