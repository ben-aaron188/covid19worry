I feel sad that we are unable to come together, it makes you appreciate the things we take for granted every day. I am lucky enough to work with colleagues who are able to explain rationally what is happening. Therefore I feel some frustration at the media panic reporting and the multitude of fake information on social media. Ultimately though, I am hopeful - thanks to the hard work I see every day and also, how communities have come together. I strongly believe this will pass, as precious epidemics have, there will be deaths. It's unavoidable, sad, families, friends. There are going to be a lot of wider impacts and I'm worried for domestic abuse victims, those with poor mental health, the homeless. We need to embrace tech to keep our relationships alive. Hope for a kinder future keeps me going
