Worried about elderly and people with long term health conditions like my brother. Worried about the pressure on NHS staff and nurses working with sick patients without appropriate PPE. Some people are still being silly and not obeying the guidelines from the government. They could ruin It for everyone. There could be food and medicine shortages which is a worry for my family as my brother has type 1 diabetes. But Iâ€™m also encouraged by the caring side that society Is showing and I am confident in the researchers and biomedical scientists that are researching COVID-19 and working on a vaccine.
