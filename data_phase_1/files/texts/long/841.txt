I am pissed off that China allowed this to spread, and even more so at the UK's ineptitude. If everyone listened to Bill Gates' Ted talk in 2015, none of this would have happened! He said that we should have a medical corps, similar to the military, with a team of experts ready to research a new disease straight away, and have proper people and infrastructure in place to develop vaccines etc.

Also the UK's approach is very silly, I can't think of much more to write here. At least the death numbers are going down in the UK, but  Boris Johnson is now ill with it, but he did go against the WHO and go for the strategy of 80% getting infected with the virus.
