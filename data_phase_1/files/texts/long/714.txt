I'm not too concerned about catching corona (I'm pretty sure I have already had it). I'm more concerned about how the lock downs that several countries have imposed will affect the economy in the upcoming months. 

However I do also believe that the country and world economy will eventually bounce back from this, but I do think that it will be a while until we see a full recovery.

The human race is great adapting to surviving against the odds and this is another factor that we will adapt to.
