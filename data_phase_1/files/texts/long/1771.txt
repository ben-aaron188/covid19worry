Currently working from home missing normal daily work life and colleagues. Missing and worried about my parents who are at high risk and self isolating. Just wanting life to get back to normal and everyone be safe and well and listen to advice about staying at home and keeping there distance from other people to prevent the virus from spreading further. Looking forward to travelling again and taking trips with my partner to parts of the world we have not yet seen or discovered. Even just going on nights out for a meal and to the pub or socialising with friends and family. Gutted to have had to cancel a family holiday already and some special family birthdays which we had plans for and was looking forward too. Having to post presents instead of giving them to those celebrating in person.
