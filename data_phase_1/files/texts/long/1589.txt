Very worried as I feel people aren't taking things seriously enough. Also feel the government is handling it very badly. I'm very worried that my family could get it, I feel that because people are not self isolating properly, and people are not keeping a reasonable distance in shops, someone I know is going to get very ill from it, this is probably the most angry I have been in my life at a political situation, which I believe this is, as the government is clearly not doing enough to stop people from going outdoors, seeing friends and families etc.
