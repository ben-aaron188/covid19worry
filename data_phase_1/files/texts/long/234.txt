just feeling a bit anxious about the whole situation as i have asthma and elderly grandparents/older parents which puts us all in the high risk category. Also not being allowed to freely go outside is worrying even though it is much safer. But some family members still commute to work which is kind of worrying as they could unknowingly bring it home. I'm not really sure what else to add as for the most part i am just working from home so it is a pretty big distraction even though a lot of the time it is hard to concentrate on my tasks as I havent worked from home before.
