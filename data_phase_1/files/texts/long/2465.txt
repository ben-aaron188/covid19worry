It's worrying, I don't think it would be fatal to me but I fear for my older family and other friends and relatives, I also fear formy job as the economy if bound to take a terrible turn, while I am currently still in work just now (which I am thankful for) I don't know how the situation will play out after the virus. The social situation is hard to bear aswell, especially coming into the summer months, it is becoming harder and harder for people to stay away from each other in the warm weather and I think people's patience could wear off after so long, hopefully it doesn't get to that point.
