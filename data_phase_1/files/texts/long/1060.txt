I feel sad with regards to some news (colleague's death, mental health issues of peers and others); but I also feel very lucky as I can work from home - and not everyone has this opportunity. At the same time I feel a little tired of feeling lucky this way...
I also had some good news with respect to my job, so I feel a little guilty relatively to the others. I also feel powerless to help, as I do not have any relevant skills & thus I'm not useful right now. This is a silly feeling, as it doesn't help anyone; at the same time it's not actually strong enough to prompt me to do more than just a few donations and gift vouchers. 
I also feel rather sad about my friends, who are in a worse position. I feel entirely blessed with my partner - but again, I'm lucky & not everyone is. 
So, overall, it's a mix of feeling sad & damn lucky - and sad that one needs to feel lucky that way.
