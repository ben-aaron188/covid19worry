I feel that we need to take this time to ensure we do the best to stay at home and stay safe if we can. I think in this way, we can reduce the risk of the coronavirus affecting us invidually, and this can reduce our own personal stress levels and happiness. We can take this time to focus on projects that we have not had time for before, or focus on relaxation. I've found that not looking at social media/the news all the time improves my own mental state in regards to the coronavirus, because although I know the situation is dire, I'm not focusing on that by constantly analysing the news.
