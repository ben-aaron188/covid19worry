I am worried about the virus and the amount of deaths and the strain on the NHS and other businesses, I am worried that my partner may lose his job and I am fearful of my family catching it, I also miss seeing my family and wish I could be there with them now. I am happy and greatful that my family is safe and well. I know that this is not going to last forever and I'm hopeful that the future will be good. I am lucky to have a job I know is secure for the future but unsure about my partners job. I am hopeful that this will allow the government to see how valuable key workers are and appreciate the jobs that matter more than finances and business men.
