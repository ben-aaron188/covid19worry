i feel no matter what everyone loses. its an unfortunate inevitability and the most depressing part of it all is how everyone will use it to push their own agenda while the average person is just looking to move past it. though the saddest is the fact that millions of people will have their lives drastically changed by this pandemic for the next year or so. that being said, until we know the origins and have fully understood the genome of this disease i am holding out on any opinions i have on any of the events or actions taken.
