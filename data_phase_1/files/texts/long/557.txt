Disgusted how unprotected NHS staff are and how late the government has been in trying to resolve this. Disgusted at the amount of people not adhering to guidelines for the safety of others. Sad about the amount of people dying without their families, dying alone without even care staff having the time to sit and hold their hand whilst they take their last breath. Disgusted at the attitude of current staff when someone needs to take the week off, but also feeling the pressure of having to stay at work even though they are experiencing symptoms themselves.
