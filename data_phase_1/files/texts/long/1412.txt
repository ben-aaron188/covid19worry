I feel very anxious about the current situation the world is in right now. It has left me feeling very anxious and scared about what is to come as I am aware that a long-term fix such as a vaccine is very far-off, there is limited NHS supplies of ventilators and the economy is going to be hit very hard and take a long time to recover. I have no idea about my job security in the long-term as I work in the hospitality industry and I feel trapped as I don't know when things are going to change. It feels like even when the current virus situation is contained eventually, the worst is yet to come in the aftermath of it all.
