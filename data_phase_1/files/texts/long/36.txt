I feel anxious about what will happen to the economy, whether I will have job to go back to and if I will be able to pay my bills when my furlough has ended. I'm scared that i will get Covid 19 and not survive it, even though I am not in an at risk group. I'm even more scared that my eldest grandparents or my mum who has MS will get it and not be able to fight it and will not survive. I'm worried that people are not taking the lockdown seriously Nd are still going out and socialising and therefore risking the spread of the virus.
