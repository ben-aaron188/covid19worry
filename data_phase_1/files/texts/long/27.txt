I am angry at people who are not following the guidelines and I feel that it is putting me at risk more as I have to leave the house for essentials etc. I am worried then that I am putting my family at risk after coming home from shopping! If everyone followed the rules then we would be able to get back to normal faster than if they don't. I feel that things might also get a lot worse before they get better and it scares me. I am scared that my work will dry up and I will be made redundant after this all goes away too. It will be a scary few months .
