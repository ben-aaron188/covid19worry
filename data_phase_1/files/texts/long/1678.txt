As worried and concerned as I am about the future due to Coronavirus, I actually currently feel quite calm. I feel as long as I follow Government guidelines, do my bit by staying inside and keepIng myself safe that everything will be okay. I try not to let myself think too far ahead because the scale of the problem just becomes totally overwhelming. The thing I’m finding the most difficult is not being able to see my loved ones, I really miss them, but I know it’ll be for the best in the long run.
