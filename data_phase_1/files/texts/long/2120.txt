It is a sad, sorry situation in many aspects. Could not have imagined this happening a few months ago. In spite of this, we must obey rules and try and positive. Things in time will go back to near how they were but hopefully it will make us stronger and better people. I really feel for all the front line staff,  Doctors,  nurses, paramedics,  hospital cleaners,  wardsmen,  carers and social workers.  In addition teachers, teaching assistants,. In shops the checkout staff and shelf stickers. .my feelings are of thanks to all these people doing a brilliant job. I feel sad for the destruction of our life that this virus has done. From the vulnerable  to those in hospital already or in a care home just managing. Feel sad about all scholars missing out on education.  It is also sad that loads of people will end up in debt and businesses will go bust. The last recession was a hard one so goodness knows what this  will do. It's extremely upsetting hearing of all the deaths too. Our lives are so precious.
