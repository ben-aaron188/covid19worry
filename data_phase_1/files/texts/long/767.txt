Background: depression, anxiety & PTSD; medicated venlafaxine 150mg.
Currently feeling abandoned by the govt. Both fear & despite are warring for supremacy for them. I am barely able to motivate myself to get up, even when I have to reorder meds (which I did today).
Money talks, and bullshit... rules us with a thorough lack of empathy or compassion.
This government of narcissistic sociopaths are going to kill thousands more than they have already. And it might include me, as I'm part of the lowest decile in society.
Not a good feeling when you're trying to stave off suicidal ideation, 8 months after being hospitalised for it.

Before dismissing (should you be so inclined), please investigate the state of DWP payments to us, as opposed to the promises. None of us are in a good state.
