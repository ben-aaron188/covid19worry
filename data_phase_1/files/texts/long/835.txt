I am very worried about the economy and I am angry that this has affected the money I earn. I am also angry with the idiots who keep going out when the decent people are staying in and doing the right thing. When I see people in the supermarkets browsing with their partners it makes my so cross. The other day the lady in front of me only bought a frozen pizza and a 2 litre bottle of coke. That is ridiculous. 

I am a bit scared that my parents will get corona but as my sister has already had it and has recovered already I am not too concerned about getting it myself. I think it's unfair that people are being affected in ways such as losing jobs, businesses closing down and having reduced money.
