I feel trapped and helpless today. I can’t ease my children’s worries or give them the normality they are craving. I have lost track of the days and am struggling to find enjoyment in anything. I am supposed to work from home but today I cannot concentrate on much. I want to sleep more than normal and this worries me. 

I feel that this situation is temporary yet the uncertainty of it makes that hard to keep in mind. I worry about my widowed mum who is in her house alone. I am struggling with the lack of contact with her and my brothers family as we are close. I am trying to minimise time on media because I have so little confidence in the government and it only exacerbated my feeling of worry. I do not fear dying, I fear the changes to life it will being for so many and for society. On other days I feel hopeful it will change the world for the better but today I am struggling to see that hope when the frontline are not being given the support they need. I feel anger that the government who have let the NHS down in so many ways, refused them pay rises, refused to listen to their needs can stand outside and clap them for the great job they are doing DESPITE them with straight faces and be praised for it. I feel angry that no one can give a straight answer to journalists questions and the public are not being guiding through this time of crisis as they should be, as they deserve to be.
