I'm frustrated at people in the local community not taking the situation seriously, they are taking their whole family to the shops, breaking into closed parks and putting other members of the community at risk.  

My daughter is in the high-risk category which causes anxiety and concern. We've been advised not to leave the house for 12 weeks. 

We're trying to help people in need and my partner is going to run a marathon around the garden, we're hoping to raise money for the local families who are struggling to feed their family.
