It's a unfortunate situation and has taken a toll on everyday life for normal people and has caused fear amongst them. At times I'm frustrated since the weather is just becoming beautiful and it's wasted indoors. At the moment I've come to accept the actions we have to make to combat coronavirus and I'm thankful for medical professionals who still work and get infected to treat their patients. I'm not really angry or sad but bored at times. Sometimes I feel frustrated since my education is affected aswell. I cannot study on my own will so it's hard to maintain discipline whilst being at home during the lockdown
