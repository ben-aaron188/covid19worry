Very nervous at the moment, it’s hard to relax and I am just on edge all the time. Even when I wake up with a sore head or something else you are paranoid in case you have caught it. Worrying time’s and pray it’s over soon. I miss doing the normal basic things like visiting friends and family and I feel it has changed my attitude towards life in general. I work in a hospital myself and am worried I pass it onto my wife. I can accept myself catching it but am unsure I could handle seeing my wife catch it because of me.
