I feel very unsettled because we do not know how long lockdown will last and what is to come. I feel sad because I want to see my family but I am in my one bedroom flat with my boyfriend in a different city. I am happy that I do not have to work at the moment. I feel sad at the same time because the period of time that I am on furlough leave will be added onto my fixed term contract which means more time apart from my family. I feel very cooped up and lethargic. I also feel unproductive and have not done anything of value since I have been off work. I feel anxious going out even for a walk
