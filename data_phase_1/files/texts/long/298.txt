In general I have gotten used to it, but it's making me stressed out as a current university student. My online classes aren't as good and it feels like a terrible way to end my final year. My graduation has been postponed, I can't visit my family over Easter, and I'm worried about my chances of getting a job when uni is over. Going to the supermarket makes me very anxious as people get too close and you have to wait in line to shop. The stock is also low which makes me worried about what to have for dinner as I like to plan out the week in advance (routine makes me feel stable, but this is becoming unachievable).
