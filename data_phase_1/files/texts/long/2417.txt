I am feeling better than I was. Previously, I was extremely concerned and I couldn't see an end to it. However, the death rate has been dropping quite considerably and I can see a faint glimmer of light. Of course, it may be a temporary lull but I feel quite hopeful. I feel like I am coping well with lock down, also. Other people I work with have been really struggling with their mental health because of Coronavirus but I have been able to put things in perspective. Previous generations have had it much worse and have had more to contend with. They got through that and we can get through this.
