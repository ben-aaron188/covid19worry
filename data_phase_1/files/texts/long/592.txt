I am very nervous about the current situation as I am missing my family and do not know when I will see them again.

I wish there was an end to this in sight so my life can return to normal. 

I feel very upset for all those who have died already and do worry that it will effect someone I know in horrible ways.

I feel a bit stressed about how I am going to pay bills because I am self employed and my working tax credits have been stopped because I made a claim for universal credit thinking it would help.
