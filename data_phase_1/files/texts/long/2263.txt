I feel quite calm at the moment since I'm following the rules set out by our government. Although I wonder how the economic situation will later in the coming months. I'm not happy about the rush of people hoarding mass amounts of food to a point when there is not enough for everyone else. Hopefully next year, I can travel to places I want to go because I want to see my friends from other countries.  I'm disappointed in others that are not following the rules as it's quite annoying as the guideline was set out.
