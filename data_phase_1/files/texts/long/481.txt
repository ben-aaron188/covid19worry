I mostly feel quite bored and frustrated about having to stay in. I understand that vulnerable people need to be protected but I feel like the current restrictions are overkill. I think this is particularly the case as I am living at home with my family and there are a lot of people in the house and they are all frustrated too so we wind each other up and people get a bit snappy. I am a bit confused about how this will be resolved and why it is so different to a typical year where vulnerable people might catch flu or norovirus. I am also slightly anxious about not being able to earn money this summer as I am a student. However, right in this moment I have had quite a relaxing day and so my level of anxiety about this is fairly low and I feel happy enough.
