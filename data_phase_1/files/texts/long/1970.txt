I woke up today feeling very anxious and I haven't been able to shake it off all day. I am hearing more stories about people dying. These aren't people known to me but friends of friends. It all seems so close to home. 
I have a pain in my chest when I get anxious and I have been feeling it all day. 
I went to the post office earlier and most people are taking the social distancing seriously but the ones who don't really wind me up and it makes me feel worse. I asked a woman to stand back and she rolled her eyes at me and it made me so cross. I wanted to have a go at her but i didn't want her talking in my direction because the disease might be airborne and I don't want to breathe in her breath. 
It's horrible because I feel out of control and that's what gives me the anxiety. I feel safe inside my home but when i have to go out it's horrible. 
My kids are ok, they don't seem to mind but I am really feeling the pressure to home educate and carry on working. My eldest has extra help at school and I am worried he will fall behind because of this. 
That gives me extra anxiety.
Also the age gap between them (3 years) makes it hard to do home school because the youngest is 4 so he ends up watching tv half the day which makes me feel like a terrible mother.
