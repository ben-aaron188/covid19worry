I feel very sad and frustrated. My father was diagnosed with motor neurone disease just before coronavirus took hold. I am so sad to be missing out on precious memories with him and hope once this is all over I will still have time.  We have had to cancel our family holiday to Italy and I worry I will never get that chance again.  
Iâ€™m worried for my husband who needs to return offshore next week and fear for his safety. 
Myself and my daughters have been self isolating for 5 weeks now as my eldest daughter is immunosuppressed.  My children miss their friends and schools. 
This is an extremely hard time for everyone but we all need to do as we have been asked and we will get through it.
