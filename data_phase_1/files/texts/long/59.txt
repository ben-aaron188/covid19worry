I feel very very sorry for all the people around the world. It's a very sad situation and makes me cry! The worst is that after the virus, I think is  coming unseen financial crisis and a lot of people will be hungry and will become very poor.
I also feel angry about the way this happen, as I believe this could have been stopped before it goes out of control.
The only think we can do at the moment is to follow the rules and pray to God.
Maybe we all become too materialistic and bad to each other and that is why this is happening so we can stop and think a bit and become better!
