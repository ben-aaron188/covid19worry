At this moment I am quite worried, anxious and stressed out. This uncertainty is really bothering me as I do not know when the things will get back to normal and I will be able to see my family again. I haven't seen them for a long time as they live abroad and I miss them. I am also worring about my job, finances and the impact it may have on my future career. I have been working so hard to save some money and I am afraid that I may loose it all now. I has become really depressing that I can't spend too much time outside and I have to stay at home instead. I have also had to cancel my pre-booked holiday and I do not know if I will have a chance to go abroad this year.
