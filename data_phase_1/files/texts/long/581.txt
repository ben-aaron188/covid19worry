I am anxious for my family - my wife is an NHS frontline worker and my parents are in the high risk cohort for the virus. All of us are staying in the same house as we have only one house. Further, I am to start a new job soon but I have no idea how I'll do that since the entire nation is under lockdown. 
I am also worried whether they will keep me in my job once normalcy is resumed given the economic downturn. I am also worried about my grandparents who are staying alone, and away from all of us.
