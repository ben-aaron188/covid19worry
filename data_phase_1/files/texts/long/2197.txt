Concern for the PM being in intensive care. Fear of the illness being brought into my home by my husband having to keep going out to work or shopping. Frustration at not being able to go out and live a normal life. Frustration at not being able to order in shopping when that's what we've been told to do. Missing my friends and family - video chat isn't the same as real human interaction. Bored of being stuck at home, bored of the same company. Trapped. Claustrophobic. Irritated by people judging others - especially on social media - without knowing other people's circumstances.  Worried for my children's mental health and their education during this time
