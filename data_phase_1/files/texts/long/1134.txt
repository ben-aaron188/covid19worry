I am feeling very scared. Scared for my partner, for my children and for myself. I am paranoid about one of us catching it.  My OCD has intensified and my anxiety is spiralling out of control. I am petrified one of us will get ill. I am worried about losing money/jobs. I am struggling to cope with being in lock down.  If lockdown gets stricter I fear I will not cope.  I am so very sad for all of the lives lost and scared for all of the frontline workers battling to save everyone.  I canâ€™t see a way out from this.
