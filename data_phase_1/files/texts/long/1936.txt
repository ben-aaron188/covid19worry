I feel it is the unknown about the situation that makes me feel anxious about the world at the moment. If there was a definitive end date when the world would return to normal and everything was as it was people to the pandemic I would be far more happy, regardless of the length of time it could take. Not knowing when this is going to be frustrating me as I'm a person who likes to feel under control. As a family it is very difficult to speak to other members of the family without feeling upset and/or frustration at not being able to see them on a regular basis, which i have done previous to the breakup of the pandemic.
