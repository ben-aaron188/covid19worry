I am nervous about the situation. I am nervous and scared that I will lose someone I love. It is a situation affecting the whole world, so everyone is in the same boat, but I am scared for others - not myself.

I know the importance of the social distancing and the lockdown, but I am so excited for it all to be lifted and for everything to get back to normal. I cant wait till I can see my friends and family again, but I know that by not seeing them they are safe, because you are safe if you're inside.
