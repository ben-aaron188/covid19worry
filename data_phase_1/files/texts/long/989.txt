I feel that people are not taking the situation seriously, people still decide that they should leave there home for non essential reasons. This is why I am disgusted as if this continues, in my opinion, the crisis will never slow down. However, I believe that the government will do there best to try and slow the rate of spread. I also believe that things are blow out of proportion. I also believe that this will take longer to get rid of than people expect as it is a global pandemic and it will take years for things to be restored.
