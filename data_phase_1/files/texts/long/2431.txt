I feel very worried for my friends & family, it is a very anxious time & being on lockdown although it is very.important is quite lonely for me. I work for the HS & I worry I may catch the virus & I worry also that there is not enough protective clothing for staff. Each day I give thanks to God that my family &friends are okay.it is also very frustrating that we can no longer make plans or worship in Church but hopefully the day will come when we shall be able to do this again & never take anything for granted again
