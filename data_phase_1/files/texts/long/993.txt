Mainly anxiety, that more people will get the virus - including me and my loved ones. I’m also anxious we’ll be in lockdown for a lot longer than expected, and things won’t return to normal for a while. I’m getting married at the end of the year and I want it to go ahead - as we’ve already postpone it once before. But I’d like things to go back to how they were before. My job seems stable for now but I’m nervous if this goes on for longer there could be redundancies. I was set to be promoted before lockdown as well but that’s been put on hold, so I felt slightly sad about that too. I guess it’s just a lot of uncertainty.
