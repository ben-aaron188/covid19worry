I feel very happy as I'm isolated with my family, and spending lots of quality time with my husband and two children. I now speak with my extended family every day which I never used to. It's a much more simple life which is something that I've always wanted to aspire to, but never managed to achieve while living in London. However, if I look on social media, the news, and take in the gravity of the situation, I feel scared, worried, anxious and fearful. I feel protected in my bubble in my home, but I worry for the future and our finances and our health.
