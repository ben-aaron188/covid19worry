I feel stressed, anxious and worried about health, money and employment. I feel overwhelmed and pessimistic about the future. I feel disgusted that it has been allowed to come this far. I am concerned about what is going to happen and how the UK will bounce back from all of this. The lockdown is quite stressful and emotional. It makes me feel nervous and worried for myself, friends, family and the rest of the country. I harbour resentment to the government and people of China for not putting a stop to the disease as and when they had it so that it didn't spread an affect all countries.
