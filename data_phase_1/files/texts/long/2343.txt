I'm extremely worried about several things. Most immediately, I'm worried about contracting the virus and becoming ill, with all that entails or might entail. 

I have equal concerns for those dear to me - my family and friends, as well as people I'm less close to. How will they come out of this? Most of all, I have children, and like any parent I'm always fearful for their safety and well-being.

I'm also extremely concerned about the longer term impact this is going to have on society, and distrustful of those in power to implement fair and just policies to recover from the inevitable economic recession.
