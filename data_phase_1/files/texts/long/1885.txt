I am currently pregnant with my 2nd child and a toddler at home. I am in a fortunate position in that I wfh and can continue to do so but am sad that I cannot see my family or go out if I want to. I have been social distancing for 4 weeks already and will continue to do so. I am also sad about the people still not abiding by social distancing and flouting the rules. There are so many that are trying to follow the rules and get through this when many are not. I am happy that I have a very good situation at home, am comfortable still paying my bills and earning 2 people's incomes.
