I have a young family and older parents, both of whom I'm really worried about. I know I'm in a fortunate situation because I haven't yet been impacted economically and I am trying to enjoy the extra time we are spending together as a family, but I am anxious about the long term implications especially with regard to my children. I am also worried about relaxation of rules which might put my parents at risk. I dont want to stay in longer than we need to as I am keen for my older son who is 6 to be back at school as I feel I'll equipped to deliver a terms worth of school and work full time. I am also concerned that he will miss so many social experiences over the summer. I'm concerned my younger son will struggle to settle back into childcare after spending this extended period of time at home. Both my parents have underlying health issues and I hope they stay well enough that they dont have to go into hospital at any point as I worry they would pick up covid-19 while there. I am also anxious that Boris Johnson is seriously unwell and the lack of leadership within govt if he isnt back soon. Not because I think he is competent, but at least hes not dominic raab.
