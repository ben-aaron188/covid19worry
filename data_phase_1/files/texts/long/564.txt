I feel calm and sensible. I understand the risks and I follow the NHS guidance of limiting my time outside of my home and practising social distancing when I am out and about. 

Covid-19 will be with us for a long time and we must be calm and rational in how we deal with everyday life.

I am currently working from home with ease. I keep in regular contact with work colleagues and friends and family using video conferencing. I live with my wife, so I don't suffer from any self-isolation issues. We have regular chats about the current situation. 

I feel wider society need to play their part by respecting the rules of social distancing and not leaving the home for unnecessary trips.

I feel that after this crisis is over key workers and NHS staff will be more valued than ever.
