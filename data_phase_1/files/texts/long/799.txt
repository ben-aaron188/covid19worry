I feel that I am doing all I can to protect myself and my partner by following the rules but the fact that others are not makes me angry.  I worry all the time how bad I will be affected if I contract covid-19 and I cannot help but fixate on those who have died and how similar they are to me and how easily I could become a victim of this virus.  I am unable to sleep at night for worry even though I know realistically that there is nothing more I can do.  It makes me angry knowing that if I do  get this virus it will be because of someone else not doing as they should, I am beginning to view people outside of my household with fear and I canâ€™t even open my windows for fear of someone walking past the house with the virus and spreading it to me
