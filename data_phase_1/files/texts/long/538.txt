It has spiked my anxiety and my depression. I cannot go to work and my life has become mundane.
My local gym has closed and my daily workout has had to be put on hold. Exercise helps my mental health so this is also bad. I miss socialising with friends and family.
I especially miss my children, who I am currently unable to visit due to the high risk category into which their mother falls.

I just want all of this to be over. I am not especially worried that I will suffer from the virus, but my entire life has been put on hold.
