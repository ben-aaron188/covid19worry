I am sad, and low. I can't see my family, including my brothers new born baby. I can't see my boyfriend, who i have known and loved for 1 years but only been in a relationship for 2 months. I'm locked inside with my mum who just wants to argue. I'm struggling to sleep at night, but not able to nap in the day.
I  can't pop to the shop for a simple loaf of bread without having to wait outside for 40 minutes to get in, because everyone elses idea of essential shopping is Â£300 worth of food meaning they are taking hours to shop, and no one can enter the store until someone else comes out
