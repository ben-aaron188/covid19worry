I feel quite anxious as many people are not following the lockdown rules and are still leaving the house. I am upset about the amount of deaths and also the uncertainty of this situation. However, I have managed to be quite relaxed about the pandemic overall by trying not to read the news too often. Overall, I have been just about coping by trying to remain calm and talk to friends/family. Despite being quite scared about all of this I think it is important for me to stay busy and productive. I also try to not listen to those who are blatantly fear-mongering for attention.
