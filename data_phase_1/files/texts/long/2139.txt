Im feeling a combination of anxiety and fear for my loved ones. Im also angry that reckless people allowed this to happen to spread in the way that it has. Im also annoyed that I had to cancel my holiday and will spend my 40th birthday in lockdown, though I feel guilty by being annoyed by such a trivial thing. Im angry that China have reopened the wet markets even this is likely to have been the source of the virus. Im also worried that governments will push through all manner of draconian measures on the back of this once things calm down.
