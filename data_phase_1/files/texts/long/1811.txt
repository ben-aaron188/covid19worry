I am very anxious and scared about things i bring into the house, and very anxious on the uncertaintity that still surrounds the whole situation as I believe we will be stuck in lockdown for a long time. I am worried for my mum and brother and being so far away from them I wish i could be with them during this time
I am taking this time to look after my personal mental health and trying to relax more but this is proving difficult as I live in a tiny studio with another person and donâ€™t have a garden or any other space to go to
