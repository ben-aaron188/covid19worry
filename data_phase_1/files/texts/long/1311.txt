I feel anger because I am a key worker and I have to be at work every day risking my health. Then people who should stay at home are outside having good time. Running every day, on bikes with families and every day I see them shopping (example they came just for one banana every day-idiots). It is to hard for them to stay at home and they have paid for that- extra holiday.  if I have a chance to stay at home I would stay. For me them people should pay for that behaviour.  If people are not gonna listen every advise by nhs it will be long time it will finish. Only thing I am asking is STAY HOME
