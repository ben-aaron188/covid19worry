I feel very sad for the people that have died and are suffering. I am furious at the politicians and special advisers handling of this issue. The UK could have had a head start in tackling this for example in January had politicians in power been less concerned about reckless pursuit of Brexit and more focused on the public good. The cabinet and PM are woefully inadequate eg PM boasts about shaking hands with people and now he has caught it. I feel for the NHS who as a result of our inadequate politicians in power are dying and suffering. In general I feel positive about the UK coming through due to the quality of the average person in the population.
