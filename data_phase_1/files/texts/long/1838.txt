I am scared for me and my family. I have 2 boys living with me who I am concerned about and I also have a disabled daughter who lives alone who I am very concerned about. I don’t want carers coming in but I can’t do it myself so I have no choice but to have carers into her. But it worries me that she may contract it through carers. I am feeling worried and anxious but can’t talk to my boys because I don’t want to worry them about my fears. It’s been a stressful time and homeschooling I am worried I can’t help my child with that and he will fall behind
