I am not too worried about contracting the virus as I am working from home and only go out for food and a solitary walk. I am following government guidelines to the letter with regards to this.  I am however, concerned about the impact on the economy and what life will be like once the virus is overcome. I imagine high taxation, high unemployment and rising prices. I imagine there will be redundancies in the company I work for. This causes me great concern as if I am made redundant I will not find it easy to get another job and still have 9 years to go before I get a pension,.
