I feel afraid of how the U.K. will cope over the next few weeks and I how it will ever recover. How will the children cope going back to school, how will the country cope financially? How and when will people mourn the loss of loved ones? I am also afraid that there will be so many investigations, looking for blame and how we could’ve dealt with this pandemic better when more time and focus needs to be on recovering as a nation and as smaller communities. Many people are not adhering to guidelines and although this has been a dreadful start to 2020, storms and now there is sunshine people want to go outside and they can’t. I worry about how police service will cope and NHS staff and the other key workers.
