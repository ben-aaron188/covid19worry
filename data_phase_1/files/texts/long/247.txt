I feel very anxious about the whole situation on a global level not just a national level. We do not know much about this new virus and what little we do know about it is now assisting in trying to stop or level out the spread. I think Boris is the best man for the job to handle and guide us all through this event in the best way possible.
I do fear it will take the world at least a year to get back to some sort of normality, there have been so many deaths from a situation that is hard to control without the guidance of the MP and the medical scientists who are working to find out more about this virus.
I also thing there will be big changes in how we all do things such as payments, could this see the end of cash?
