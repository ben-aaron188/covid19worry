to be honest i cant really identify what i feel right now. i dont mind not being able to go home (i reside in the uk for my studies but i go home to indonesia every summer - or supposedly) as i dont really enjoy being with my family anyway. my only concern is if i cannot go home at all this summer, and i cant spend time with people i care about at home especially my friends. i am also worried about the current economics (the exchange rate from IDR to GBP is on a consistent rise and if not it sits on a very ridiculously high rate) and that i have to spend more money (IDR) by staying here.
