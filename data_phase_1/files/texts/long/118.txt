I am inpatient for this to end. I feel a bit angry against people who are not taking it seriously as no matter what age you are, you are still vulnerable and will most likely care about someone who is significantly at risk. This scares me but I have hope and do still see the light at the end of the tunnel. I am looking towards the end of this and desire it all to be over. What makes it easier is the faith i have in some humans (particularly healthcare workers) who prove to me that there is so much to live for once this is all over.
