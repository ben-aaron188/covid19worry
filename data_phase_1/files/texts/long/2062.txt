After resigning myself to the lockdown situation, I planned to do my best for my family and myself by self isolating and felt that was the right thing to do,

As a result, I have been frustrated with monitoring news about other people, and seeing how they have not adhered to the recommendations of isolation - for the good of themselves and others. This has left me feeling frustrated.

All in all, I feel drained, anxious and have negative feelings for the near future, especially as I have given the situation some thought and can see some illogical reasoning going on, such as distanving musct go ahead but the governement not doing anything to distance key workers when they have to travel by public transport.
