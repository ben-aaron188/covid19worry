I'm worried about other people more than myself. Been furloughed from work but that's actually a positive at the moment and has helped me feel less anxious than I was before.

Older people do need to take the whole situation more seriously as they're the ones not abiding by the distancing rules and that makes me more worried about them, and the possibility that they're spreading the virus. 

The financial situation is the biggest worry, with wage cut to 80% at the moment, assuming that comes through. Plus the concern that the business I work for may not survive this situation. Therefore it is important for to try not to spend money other than on essentials as I may need it to tide me over until I can find a new job after things reopen. Other businesses may also not be hiring due to financial worries.
