It’s a bit strange as it’s something we’ve not seen before. We’re managing to get through day by day but it is worrying. I’m concerned about how long the lockdown will last and the impact of this. We’re having to buy for a couple of weeks at a time to avoid going out, but stores are half empty, this makes things really difficult when you have a newborn and simply need certain items. I’m trying to stay calm and relaxed, distracting myself to take my mind off of things but I am quite anxious about the situation.
