The situation is incredibly sad and worrying. The government’s approach has meant many people, including some of my family members, are likely to become very ill/pass away. The lack of commitment in policy at the beginning has meant there isn’t enough protection for those helping, which is incredibly sickening and saddening. The blaming of the public makes me angry. Self isolation is making me depressed, even more so because there is no clear answer or timescale or even proper precautions. I have severe anxiety revolving around university, work and being able to afford my rent and keep my house.
