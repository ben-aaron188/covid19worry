I feel sad for families who are suffering with the Covid19 and who have lost those to the virus. I feel angry about people who are not taking the pandemic seriously. It is a joint effort - the idea of being stuck at home should be transformed into safe at home. I worry that I will get it, even when I limit my time leaving the house to one excerise a day or going to the supermarket when I need. I also worry about the lack of knowledge on it. I feel hopefully knowing that other countries who were suffering have started to recover.  I feel comfort knowing I am with my family and that we are safe and healthy and I have hope that others will keep safe and healthy too.
