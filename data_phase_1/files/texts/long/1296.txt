I feel worried about the current COVID-19 situation, firstly people were dying if they suffered from underlying health conditions and now it is everyone. I work as a key worker for a homeless organisation, I am putting myself at risk but I feel the people I work with are much more vulnerable. I fear for the lives of my family, many of them are still having to go out to work as key workers. My friend works for the NHS and told me that the ICU beds in my local hospital are filling up drastically which scares me.
