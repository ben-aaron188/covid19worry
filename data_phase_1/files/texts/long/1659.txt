This situation has caused some anxiety, especially before the job retention scheme was launched by the Government. It worries me if my family members or friends get it, but I try not to think about it. I also wish people would take note of the advice, and stay at home! Our ancestors had to go to war, we’re just being asked to stay at home & sit on the sofa - it’s not that hard! I’m taking it as a chance to slow down & get stuff done that I wouldn’t have been able to at home, although I can’t wait until I can get back to work!
