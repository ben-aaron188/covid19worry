I’m really stressed and anxious because we don’t know when this will end. I also have important plans that are hanging in the balance. I don’t know if my plans are being cancelled so I’m just stuck. I have holidays booked and a new job that’s been cancelled. It’s just a bit of nightmare and friends that are ill and family we’re worried about. This is just a really hard time right now for my friends and family. It’s just unreal the amount of people this affecting. And jobs that are hanging in the balance. Not to mention the economy.
