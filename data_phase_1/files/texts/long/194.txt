I feel out of control and worried about the future. I don’t know when it will stop and what my situation will be after it all calms down.

I’m trying to keep my mental health steady but it’s difficult, being isolated and not a lot to focus on. 

I can’t wait to see my family again, I miss my niece loads and I’m tired of feeling scared and being looked at with disgust from old people when I’m on a walk. 

It has made me appreciate the important things in life, like my family and my health. I’ve had time to think about my life aspirations and I’ve allowed my mind to calm down.
