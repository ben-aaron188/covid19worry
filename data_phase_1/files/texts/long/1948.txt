I am worried that it is being poorly managed globally. It is especially likely to be a big problem in refugee camps, and i feel that global action is required immediately. equally, many affluent countries are not treating it with the seriousness it requires. I am concerned for my friends and family, but also for those i don't know. I think that staying at home (as i have been) is the least i can do, especially given the enormous sacrifices being made all across the country and across the world. i think that one of the major issues is that healthcare has been enormously underfunded over the last decade.
