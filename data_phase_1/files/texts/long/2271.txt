I feel frustrated at people who are not listening to the governments orders to stay inside. It is frustrating that the guidance is so clear, yet people refuse to give things up to save peoples lives. I have made huge changes to my life to help bring this to an end sooner but lots of other people are not trying despite it being clear how serious the coronavirus is. I feel worried that myself or people I know will become ill and the NHS will not be able to save people. It is very hard to stay positive but I am happy that people are showing their application for key workers and want to protect the NHS.
