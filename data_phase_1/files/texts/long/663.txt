Currently, everything feels very uncertain and ambiguous. A lot of misinformation is being spread, which causes conflict in opinion. I enjoy being at home and feel relaxed and safe at home, however my parents have to work which is concerning in terms of their health and mine. I would rather they review current isolation advice sooner rather than later, as so much is currently up in the air. People still arenâ€™t taking guidance which is highly ignorant. Better weather is making isolation less miserable.
