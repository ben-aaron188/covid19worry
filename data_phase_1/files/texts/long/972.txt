i am calm about the suitation. i dont think theres any point in worrying as long as your trying your best to be safe. unless someone in my family shows symptoms i will continue to work and go shopping. not much has changed for me other than having to stay at home. my kids have been affected more as they cant go to school or any after school activities. once this all settles down we will be complaining about life being so busy again. plenty of holidays and trips organised and everything back to normal.
