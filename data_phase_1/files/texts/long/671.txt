I feel very nervous about the whole situation. I feel scared to leave my house at the moment due to coronavirus. I feel incredibly grateful that I have a garden to sit out in during the nice weather to stop me from going stir crazy. I also feel very angry and annoyed at the stupid, selfish, inconsiderate people who are ignoring the lock down rules and going out to public places in large groups because they are just going to prolongue the lock down and put other people at risk of catching the virus.
