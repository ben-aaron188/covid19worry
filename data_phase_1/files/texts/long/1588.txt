I feel anxious about the actual virus - I work in a retail bakery and on shopfloor, so it's quite a worrying time for people like us! Especially seeing many, many people coming into the store for items that are not essential. I also feel sad because all my plans are on hold, even short trips planned. I also feel sad as I can't see my boyfriend at all. The only time I see him is if he comes shopping at my store! And yet we've been together 12 years. I know it's for the best but it's a sad time.  Alongside this, I feel proud to be doing what I can to help contain this virus, by working and providing essentials to people, and by staying at home on my days off.
