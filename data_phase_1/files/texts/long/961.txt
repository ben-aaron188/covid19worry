I'm feeling anxious about the situation because we now live in a changed world. This is an event that will be written in textbooks in the future and it's hard to fathom how truly extreme this will become. There is a peace of mind that I live in a country that has free healthcare if the worse was to happen and me or my family got sick. I know that i/them will be looked after and also thankful that despite an embarrassing week of panic buying. the country is coming together to help people through this
