Extremely anxious at the Unknown’s in the whole scenario. No one knows when the current situation will end and there doesn’t seem to be any clarity on the best treatment or whether this could all happen again in the future short or long term.

I worry about keeping my family safe and it makes me anger that people are using the situation for political gain. Arguments relating to political parties, 5g etc are not helpful at the moment and I don’t think people truly realise how much their actions are affecting the health of those around them.
