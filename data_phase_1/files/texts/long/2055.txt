I feel annoyed and frustrated at all of the people who are ignoring the social distancing guidelines and putting more people at risk, especially when we are being asked to simply stay at home apart from a minor number of exceptions.

I am retail supervisor, a key worker, so I am currently still working. I am amazed by the number of people who still flaunt the rules and find it difficult to hold my tongue and not call people out when they do not do as they are advised.

While I am not worried about the personal effects coronavirus would have on me, my grandparents are both in the at-risk category and are shielding for 3 months, I am worried about how they will cope with isolating for so long.
