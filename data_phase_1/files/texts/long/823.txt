I feel quite safe at home, and am actually less stressed now that I just have to stay at home focusing on finishing my phd and not going out or spending money. However, I feel very concerned about the state of the world and about people dying, particularly in countries like India which are densely populated and have higher poverty.
I also feel worried about my mum and other elderly relatives, even though they are taking suitable precautions. My mum is in a different country, which makes me feel a bit more stressed.
