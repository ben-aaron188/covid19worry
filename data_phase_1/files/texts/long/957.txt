I feel a sense of uncertainty about the situation, which in turn is making me anxious. The UK is in lock down at the moment and this alone has made me feel uneasy. There are numerous things to feel anxious about. Firstly, hearing a lot about the the death toll in the UK and who has the virus from social media and the news has made me feel anxious. Not only this, but the worry of my current job at the moment i.e. will redundancies be made if this goes on for the rest of the year.  I think my biggest worry is that no one at this time knows how long this will go on for.
