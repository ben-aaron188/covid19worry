i am anxious about what the future holds regarding the virus. my parents are 70+ and I am pregnant due in august. i want my family to remain safe. i am fearful of the unknown.
i also feel angry that help is not getting to those who need it most. my neighbours at in the at risk group, one has COPD and yet they are unable to get online groceries having not previously registered, whilst my neighbour the other side stockpiles. everyman for himself?! of course i have offered to help my vulnerable neighbours as much as possible and its nice to see how relieved my neighbour looks when i offer help.
