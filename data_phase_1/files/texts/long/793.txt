I miss my friends and family and being able to go out whenever, wherever, with whomever I want. I am sad that this has happened to the world and that so many people are suffering. I am so annoyed and angry at the people who keep flouting the government guidelines and making everyone else struggle for longer. It's unfair that they don't feel like they have to help anyone else when there are people trying to save lives. There's so much death. My mum has cancer and she's a very high risk person but she's been told she won't be able to get help if she gets the virus. Yet people who blatantly disregard the safety rules will probably be absolutely fine.
