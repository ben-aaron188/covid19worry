I hope that the situation passes with a better outcome than the experts initially thought. I hope that life returns to almost normal within the next few Weeks and only very loose restrictions are placed upon us all. I am a key worker and I continue to work through this so this helps maintain a feeling of normality and routine. I imagine if I was sat at home watching the news that I may feel more anxious and  impatient. I worry that if outside exercise is prohibited that I may not see my partner and feel isolated.
