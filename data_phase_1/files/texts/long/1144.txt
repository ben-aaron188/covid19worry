I'm feeling sad for friends who've lost people they love. I'm worried for my elderly father, aunts and uncles and for friends who are older or who have health concerns. I'm worried for the mental health of friends who have anxiety or depression. I fear that there will be an increase in suicides. And I'm concerned for myself because I have underlying health concerns, and the media seems to be daily assuming lives like mine are less important. I feel disposable to society. And I'm angry that Boris Johnson didn't act sooner to save lives.
