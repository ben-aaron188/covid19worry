I am worried about the people who are not taking the situation seriously and are putting others at risk. No one should be selfish and behave like they can do whatever they want. I’m not scared of getting coronavirus but I’m worried about passing it on to others who might not survive having it. I am finding staying at home to be quite easy because the stakes are so high. I find being alone suits me and it’s the right thing to do. I live alone so I’m having lots of time to myself to do the things I want to do. I’m a musician and I can record alone, so that passes the time and is fun.
