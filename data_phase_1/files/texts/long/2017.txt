I feel very anxious and worried about the coronavirus situation. It's affecting my sleep and my health anxiety levels have definitely gotten worse since this began.

I have also had to delete all social media and limit the amount of time I spend consuming news on the subject as I felt it was making my anxiety worse.

I have also found spending more time indoors has caused a lot more arguing and feelings of anger to emerge. It's very hard to be stuck around people 24/7 with little to no break.

Working from home has also been a struggle as I do not have a quiet space where I can shut myself away from noise and distractions. I have found myself being interrupted constantly throughout the day when trying to work. This in turn causes more anger/frustration so there has been a few arguments about this particular situation.
