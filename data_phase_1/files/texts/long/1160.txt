At this very moment I don't feel worried about the coronavirus. I'm self-employed and I can continue working from home. I'm still allowed to to outside once a day to do some exercise. I did not have any symptoms like cough, fever, shortness of breath. I know the current situation is temporary and I'm trying to find positive aspects to focus on. I now have more time to read books, practise yoga, meditate, write and focus on myself. I hope for many people this will be an excellent opportunity to connect with themselves. Actually I'm enjoying this time on my own and not meeting others, now I don't have to make excuses for not meeting other people
