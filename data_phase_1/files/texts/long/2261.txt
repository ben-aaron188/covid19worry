I am worried that I might be infected or somebody from my family and friend will be sick. I feel stressed because I don't know how long it will last. I have a problem with sleeping because I have nightmares. I have relatives living in other countries, one of them live in Italy, where the situation is very serious. It makes me more stressed. Staying at home is not that difficult if it may help to stop the virus. I think we all should keep isolating ourselves to help fight this virus. I am anxious but I have to think positively.
