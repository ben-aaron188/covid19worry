I am worried about what is happening and how long we will be stuck in the current situation and how this will effect the future economy as well as jobs but i am also happy about the effect this lock down is having on the environment. 
I am also anxious about my job and what is going to happen with it. I am also bored with not being able to see my friends and family, I have very little to do at weekends and time I'm not working
Finally am I a little scared that some of my family will get it and how it will effect them and if anyone I know will die.
