I am accepting that the coronavirus situation is what it is. I am more relaxed knowing my loved ones are now at home isolating. I am trying to make the best of a bad situation by appreciating things I can do because I am stuck at home, like spend quality time with my husband, and not have to commute to work. I am just trying to see the positives. I cannot change the situation rthat is going on, so I might as well just enjoy some of the things that have come about because of the situation. It is not a good situation that we are in, but right now there's nothing I can do to change that, It wou;ld be nice to be able to go out and do the normal things, especially when the weather is nice, but I am accepting that it is not currently possible to do so.
