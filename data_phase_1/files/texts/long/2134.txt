At the moment I feel fairly relaxed about the situation. I may not remain as relaxed as time goes on depending on how long it lasts for due to money issues but for the moment I am fine as I have some income coming in until the end of this month at least. I feel slightly nervous for anyone who has either caught it or at high risk of getting it (my mother in particular is a high risk). The reduced option of freedom of choice on going out / to anywhere is mildly inconvenient but nothing worth stressing over for now. I feel disappointment in those who have bulk bought items and feel that the government and businesses should have stepped in earlier to stop that occurring.
