I think it's a terrible situation we're in, especially for all the key workers who still have to work, makes me feel anxious. This is a huge problem for some people I know so it's a personal thing too. Also, not like the fact some people are not taking this seriously or are talking badly about it. Apart from that, I guess I have some hope as to the problem getting better after, and that there are at least a couple of positive things that have arised from this. For example, I get to have time to myself allowing me to be relaxed and enjoy or reflect on things, people are spending time with their family a lot and lastly, pollution is decreasing.
