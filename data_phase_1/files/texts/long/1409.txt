I feel a great sadness for those that have lost loved ones.  I am anxious about my family and friends and I miss them terribly.  I am comfortable in my home and do not feel trapped or anything like that.  I plod along, doing odd jobs and play games which makes me happy.  I am proud of people coming together to support one another and the generosity and kindness of strangers.  I worry about being separated from my partner and worry constantly about my dad who is a key worker.  I am grateful for my comfortable home and the fact that I have a garden.  I know many others are stuck in small homes with no outside space.
