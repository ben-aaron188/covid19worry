My main moods during this time are anxiety and worry. I am worried for family members that are high risk from this coronavirus, and I am constantly anxious about the situation and wish for it to be over as soon as possible. I am sad for the world and all the people it has lost and concerned that we will loose loads more. I'm also angry at the government for not putting anything in place sooner to stop the spread of the coronavirus. I'm also worried that my husbands work place will soon close down if the virus spreads in our area.
