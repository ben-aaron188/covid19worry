I feel anxious not knowing whether I or my loved ones will get the virus and how severely we would suffer. I am very scared that my youngest daughter would become ill and have to go to hospital without me. She would be terrified. I feel very upset that people are being asked to sign DNR forms if they are deemed as less valuable than other people. This is immoral. I feel very anxious going out weekly to do the shopping and hate mixing with others in public. I feel sad for my children missing out on important parts of their childhoods and I worry about my mum living alone at age 78.
