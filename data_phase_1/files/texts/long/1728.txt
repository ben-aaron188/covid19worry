Angry that it has gone this far. Filled with worry what will happen to our country. I dont see how we will get out of this lockdown anytime soon. Really missing seeing family and spending time doing stuff as a family. Cant wait for normal life to go back to normal and we can all enjoy our lives. The goverment now need a exit lockdown plan so we all know where we stand and businesses have clarity as to where they stand and what to do next. I do feel angry that the situation in our country got this far, people have been loosing their lives over this.
