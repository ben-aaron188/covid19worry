I feel very anxious at the minute. I suffer from anxiety in general life anyway so this is an especially horrible situation for me. I hate being stuck in, it is really affecting my mental health. The whole situation is very scary, i am worried about friends and family, worried about money since loosing my job, it is all very worrying. For me the worst thing is not knowing when it will all be over and having no idea if this is going to be our lives now for weeks, months or even years. It is so hard for everyone and right now the world is indeed a very scary place to be in.
