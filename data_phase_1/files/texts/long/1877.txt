I believe that as a whole my local community is dealing with the outbreak and advice that has been given very well. I am however still worried for myself, my family and colleagues at work. This is because I am currently training to become an Nursing Associate currently supporting my local trust as a Healthcare Assistant. Everyone that I work alongside is doing a brilliant job in the current circumstances however there is the ever present concern that we could contract Covid-19.

I am however incredibly disappointed to see that some areas and groups of people do not appear to be taking this as seriously as they should be and are putting themselves and others at risk.
