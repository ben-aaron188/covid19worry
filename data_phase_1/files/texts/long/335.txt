Worry and fear for my own and my family’s health. I have underpaying health conditions so I am scared. Anger that not everyone is following the rules, my family and I are following the rules and other people continue to visit family and friends and go out and about . Happiness that I am at home with my family and get to spend time with the people I love. I feel worry and stress that my financial situation could change is my work has to close permanently  or if my job gets furloughed as I can’t not afford as a single parent to loose any income.
