I'm not especially concerned about my health, more how it will affect my parents as they're older and more at risk. I'm fed up of lockdown - I understand why it has to happen but I live alone so it's very isolating. I have moments where I have mini breakdowns and have to accept those which isn't always easy. I also like being in control of things and I have no control at all. I'm uncertain about holidays I have booked for later in the year (I've already had to cancel two which is rubbish but in the overall scheme of things relatively minor.)
