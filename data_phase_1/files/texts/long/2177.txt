Due t my course midwifery I am very anxious as I still have to attended my placement in hospital. Unpaid or defer a year. Although I am still attending so I can get my degree our placements can be cancelled at any given moment meaning we have to take an extra year of student finance out, my boyfriend has asthma as well and I am worried if I catch it I may pass it onto him. If I also get sick and have to take two weeks of I will still not complete my degree this year. University is now online and we donâ€™t have access to the same resources we did before but are expected to complete all the work at the same tkme
