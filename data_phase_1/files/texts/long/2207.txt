I am confused, there are conflicting opinions from different sources about the best way to handle things. I am sad, mainly for others who are suffering greater hardship that me, but also for myself. I am missing my family and friends, I worry for them. I am anxious about the outcome, not only in terms of the health implications, but also for the economic future of the world. I also feel proud of the way the uk government are handling the crisis, and pleased that the vast majority of citizens who are complying with the new rules.
