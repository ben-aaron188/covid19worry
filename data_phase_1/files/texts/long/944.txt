As I am a student, Corona has given me an opportunity to take a much needed break from school, and spend more time with family. it has also allowed me to change my lifestyle for the better (more time to exercise, eat healthy, keep up routines etc). However, I feel bad for those who are affected, whether by the virus, or just feeling lonely. I also understand the impacts it is having on the economy on a global scale. None of my immediate family have been severely impacted by the virus, so I probably do not feel as scared or worried as other people.
