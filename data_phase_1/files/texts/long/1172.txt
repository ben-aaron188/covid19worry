I feel quite anxious about how little we know about what is coming. Additionally, telling myself to not be anxious usually results in me becoming more anxious, which is what has been happening. However, I've also luckily still got my job as I can work remotely, which is very reassuring. I have been trying to maintain the social distancing rules set by the government, which does mean I have a lot more free time than usual. I need to start exercising more, so that has been on my mind recently. Taking walks relaxes me and really helps, but it's very difficult to motivate myself to leave my room sometimes, which can make me feel even worse.
