I am currently in day 8 of self isolation due to having a cough. I have spent all the time at home with my family and I feel very chilled out and just enjoying the family time together. Coronavirus is scary but by staying inside, I have less of a fear of it as I am not near other people. I feel very happy and I have managed to get a few jobs done around the house and I'm spending valuable time with my 2 year old which, as a full-time working parent, I don't get to do all of the time so it has been nice albeit not the nicest of circumstances.
