I am feeling isolated and lonely. That’s my overwhelming emotions right now and it has significantly impacted my mental health. It has caused a low mood, a lack of motivation and general lethargy.

I am frustrated that some people seem to believe the rules don’t apply to them undermining the sacrifices many of us making.

Also, I am concerned how this pandemic will impact our lives going forward. When will these social distancing measures end? Will our society be more divided because we’ve been encouraged to distance ourselves from one another? 

And how will this effect my future. Will getting a graduate job be more difficult? Will I be financially insecure for the first time? Am I going to be able to live the life I’ve become accustomed to?
