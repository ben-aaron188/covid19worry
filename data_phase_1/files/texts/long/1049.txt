My main feeling with COVID-19 is I just want everything to be back to normal. I want to be able to see my friends and family and I want to live my life normally. I'm worried about loved ones becoming Ill especially those vulnerable. I feel slightly frustrated that some people still don't see the threat and are going about their everyday lives. However I do feel hope in the way the UK government is handling the situation and how the majority of people are supporting them. I do also feel upset for those businesses who have been economically effected and will no longer be able to carry on. I also spent my birthday in lockdown which was not pleasant as we had intended to have a family get-together in which I would have seen distant relatives. So overall I would just like life to be back to normal.
