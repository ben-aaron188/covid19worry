At the moment I am slightly anxious, more so of the thought of my little one being in hospital alone if she got ill rather than me or my partner getting ill. I'm disgusted at the amount of people swanning around not taking this seriously. It's hard to not feel anxious when so many things are shared on social media... as you never know what is fact and something can make you scared or annoyed just like that. 
I'm hopeful that I'll be able to pop out now and not struggle to get basic food that we need .
