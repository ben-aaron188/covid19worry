I feel pretty worried about the situation at the moment- mostly because my job doesn't feel secure. My employer advised us all today that we might be at risk of job losses. We have already had our hours and our salary cut by 20%. I'm worried I could lose my job and what would happen if I did lose it. 

I also feel sad because a relative passed away and I am not able to fly to my hometown to be with my family. My grandma is also is hospital and my mum has been made redundant so I wish I could see them to support them. 

I have fear about any of my relatives getting this virus, and about catching it myself. 

I also feel concerned about the future and hate not having any visibility on how long this will all go on for. It makes me anxious not being able to go about my daily life as normal.
