I feel very anxious about what is going to happen in the future. I am also very scared just incase a family member gets covid-19 or if i get it myself. If the corona virus enters my household it will make me even more anxious than before. All of this creates fear and sadness amongst me and everyone else in my community. Despite all of this i still feel hope because our government is doing a very good job in prtecting us by implementing methods such as social distancing. To keep myslef happy and to keep myself in good spirits i have been watching lots of TV nd watching movies on netflix.
