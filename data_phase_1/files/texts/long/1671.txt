Frustrated with people who aren't complying with the lockdown. Sad that I am not getting to spend time with family and friends. Worried older family members might get ill. Worried that the NHS might get overwhelmed. Confused by the UK's current testing strategy. Bored of staying inside all day. Hopeful that a vaccine will be developed relatively soon. Overwhelmed by the news media on the subject - there must be other news which is getting forgotten e.g. Brexit
