I am worried about the outcome of the virus in regards to how businesses and jobs will recover. I am also worried about how long it will take to get back to normal life and if we return to normal life we might have the same problem. I am worried that the virus might reoccur and we may never really be over it. I am also worried about catching it as I donâ€™t know how my body will respond and who I might pass it too. I am happy with how I am responding to the virus in terms of social distancing but I am also angry that others are not doing the same and are putting others at risk
