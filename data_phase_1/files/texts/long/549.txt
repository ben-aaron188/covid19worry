Apprehensive about the situation. Sad and scary how many lives are being lost and how many people are affected. Some amount of fear as I donâ€™t want me or my family to catch it in case we get bad symptoms. Being cautious and trying to follow government advise by avoiding going outside unless I really need to. I wish more people would follow the same advise. I hope they get a vaccine soon so we can return to normality and save lives. I will remain positive for the future and hopeful we all get through it.
