I am able to work from home, its a nice day today and I've been working in the garden for the last hour so I'm very comfortable.  I am able to do my weekly shop at my local supermarket down the road which is not too much bother and I am making an effort to stay at home unless I go for a walk (once a day) or shop (once a week) so I feel happy as I can be in this scenario and happy to sit it out until we are allowed to go out more freely. I have concern and anxiety for the older people in our communities, particularly those more stubborn that insist on going out and popping to the shops several times a week putting themsleves and others at risk.  I appreciate not everyone is able to be too comfortable at home due to a variety of factors but I think its important for us to all make the best effort we can.
