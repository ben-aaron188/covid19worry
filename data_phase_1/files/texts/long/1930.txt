Overall I feel overwhelmed. It is hard not to become all consumed with the information, the fear, the anxiety and the worry. It is hard to find a way to feel useful. Living day by day is better than trying to focus on the longer term and finding small tasks to complete to bring a sense of success and achievement are important. Each day I go to bed later in a bizarre attempt to delay the coming of the next day and all the headlines of more infections, deaths and stories that the day surely brings. Daily conversations - and especially video ones! - with people are a real lifeline. Fake news worries me enormously. In a way I feel 'safe' in lock down and I worry more about all that comes next.
