I feel trapped, lonely and unmotivated. It’s the feeling of not knowing that is driving me insane, not knowing when this will be over is the worst part. Not seeing family or friends that you require to distract yourself and not being able to be productive. It’s not nice at all. I’m scared for the vulnerable people, the elderly, the NHS, essential workers etc. It’s not a nice time at all and if I’m feeling like this at 19, I can’t imagine somebody at 60+ maybe sat alone worrying at home. It’s boring not having anything to do, especially being in a small household with little money it’s never nice to be sat there worrying about your next meal, or when this will all resolve.
