Generally, I am both feeling anxious and angry as I was meant to be sitting my a-levels but now I am not. My exam board have still not informed us on how our results will be calculated along with other details about resits etc. I am worried I won't meet my entry requirements now; this has become a source of immense stress as right now my whole future is up in the air. I am also frustrated with the inability to see my friends and enjoy life like it was before this outbreak. Days have become monotonous with minor variation which is slowly having a negative effect on my mental health.
