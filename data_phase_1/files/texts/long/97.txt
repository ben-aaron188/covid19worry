I feel as though not enough people are taking this pandemic seriously. The sooner people follow the lockdown rules the sooner this will all be over. There are so many people dying from this horrible virus everyday - this is serious. My friends grandma sadly died from the Coronavirus last week and because some people arenâ€™t sticking to the lockdown he is not able to have a proper funeral and send off for his grandma. This makes me feel awful for him as I know how close he was with his grandma. They are distraught with this and how little people seem to care about this whole thing. I am also not able to see any of my family or friends because of the lockdown, this saddens me but I know I have to stick to these rules put in place by the government because the end result will be worth it when I know I can see my family again and not be scared about any of us having the virus. Unfortunately not everybody understands how serious it is and are being careless - still going out to see their friends and family - still leaving the house more than once a day for non-essential things. Just two days ago I went to the shop to do a weekly shop for 4 people in our house, a young teenage couple in the line in front of me waited at least 20 minutes in the queue to go in and buy one energy drink - things like this ARE NOT essential. Their parents need to sit them down and talk to them until they understand how much things like that are affecting the whole county.
