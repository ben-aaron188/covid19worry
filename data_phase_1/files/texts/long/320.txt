I have a feeling of fear for not knowing what is to come
In the next few weeks.  I also have frustration because of the people who are not following the lockdown guidelines.   I have a great deal of anxiety about catching covid19 as I live with nhs frontline workers I donâ€™t want to be the one that makes them have to stay at home and not work. I hate having to go to the supermarket for essentials as this means having to be in close proximity of other people. I miss being able to go out for walks and to the shops
