I go through stages of feeling anxious, usually after I have read/watched the news. I am away from my parents who are both in a vulnerable group so my anxiety is more for them and their health. At the same time, I am enjoying being at home with my partner. In general, I am feeling fine. I often feel guilty that this is the case as I can see the pain people are in and the grief they feel. I feel emotional when I think about all the people going to work, especially medical staff - the stories of them dying makes me feel very sad. I also feel very grateful at the moment, grateful I have a house to isolate in, a partner to reassure me, family that care about me. I am also more appreciative of the natural world.
