I feel very uncertain about the current situation, provided that my University and employment has been cancelled. This places a burden on both my academic and financial state., which further increases my worrying.  
I am also worried about mine and my family's wellbeing and health in general. I am trying to be cautious and follow the government's rules and regulations, but the whole panic in the news and society just makes me a bit scared and causes me further anxiety.
I am also a bit lonely as I have had to cancel plans to see my friends and family due to the outbreak. 
Finally, I am really nostalgic about things that I used to enjoy before, while now I feel like I am missing out on experiences. 
Surprisingly, the experience of being so restricted makes me feel grateful and appreciating of everything that I was able to do before the lockdown.
