I feel like I'm no longer fully in control of my life. The situation changes day by day so its not currently possible to adequately plan even days ahead with any proper certainty anymore. 

It's extremely frustrating being cooped up inside, and its negatively affecting my mental health. 

I'm a very socialable person so not being able to interact face to face is difficult. However, paradoxically I'm actually communicating with people I wouldn't ordinarily regularly communicate with since I'm now more aware of how valuable, and important, social ties are.
