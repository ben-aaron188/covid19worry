Not particularly worried about myself but concerned for family, especially those who are older or otherwise particularly vulnerable to the worst effects of coronavirus. Although I can see that positive steps have been made, I am generally disappointed with the government response, both in terms of mixed messaging and the failure to expand testing capability. I think the financial measures to protect jobs, encourage workers to stay home, and assist people to pay bills must go further. I am very worried for those in the health service, particularly due to the shocking lack of PE and ventilators, which is at least partly due to the failings of Conservative governments to fund the NHS and other public services.
