My husband is shielding due to leukemia, this means I am afraid to leave the house in case I should catch the virus and bring it home with me. We have been at home for 3 weeks now and luckily I have an online shop, but after that I will have no choice but to go out.  This is a big fear, but worse is that my daughter's partner is a hospital doctor and I could not bear for him or her to be ill or for one of them to die. This fear wakes me up at night.  My son and his partner are sensible and are staying safe at home, but my daughter's partner can not and would not even if he could choose to.
