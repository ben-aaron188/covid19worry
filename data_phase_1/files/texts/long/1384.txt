I am feeling very worried about the statistics of the disease. Looking at the effects worldwide makes me worry it will have a lasting impact on the world as a whole when it's over, catastrophic potentially. Could compare it to a world war in thirty years time. Right now my biggest fear is spreading it to someone else. I may have already caused the death of another human being in this outbreak. Makes it very hard to muster the courage to go out to even get essentials, I've been tempted to try and get deliveries for the foreseeable future.
