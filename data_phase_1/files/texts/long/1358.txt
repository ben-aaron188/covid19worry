Both my daughter and I feel very lonely and bored due to the current situation as we are used to seeing people daily. We fully understand why the lockdown is in place and appreciate and adhere to it - we just wish everyone else would and then hopefully this would end sooner instead of being prolonged.
I do wonder why China are keeping everyone in the dark regarding their true numbers of cases and deaths -honesty could have helped other countries deal with this sitiation sooner and better. Why there is still a huge cover up going on is astounding.
