I felt more anxiety last week as I felt the government had not done enough. The fact that Europe's situation is improving has made me less anxious. I feel frustration that the government should have done more to prepare like the German government

Following the news, it appears that we are approaching the peak and appear to have avoided as bad an outbreak in Italy or Spain.

I still feel anxious about my economic situation and the aftermath of the lockdown. I have kept my job for now but if the lockdown continues I worry about losing my job which I had just started two months ago and which took a lot of effort to get after many months of interviews.

I do not have any family at severe risk in this crisis which has made it a less stressful time for me, but the overall effects of this crisis are still depressing particularly the young victims
