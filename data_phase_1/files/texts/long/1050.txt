I grow frustrated at idiots who aren't taking it seriously and whose actions and selfishness puts others at risk. I risk my own health daily as a key worker and they show a lack of respect for me in doing so. I lose my voice from directing people and I stand in in the wind to have to deal with morons who can't follow simple instructions like being asked to stand behind the line. I have to stay professional while they go shopping for red bull and crisps, when all I want to tell them is to stay the fuck home. I think the profanity there sums up my feelings on the matter.
