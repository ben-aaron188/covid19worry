Worried and scared how rapid the whole situation is regarding the virus. Large spreads with idiots still outside than staying indoors. People need to realise this is a serious thing but people are looking at it like itâ€™s a national extended holiday. A fast acting serious dangerous thing causing people to die and people are acting relaxed and being selfish. This country should be on full lock down and kick this virus out because it is totally Taking over. Stay safe, stay indoors, stay away!! We need to cut this virus in the bud and stop the spread, act now act fast and stay safe
