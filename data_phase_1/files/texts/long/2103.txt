I feel very scared for my children and myself and my husband and both our families and friends. I am a key worker so am unable to isolate myself. I am saddened on a daily basis by the sheer number of deaths across the World and I am angered by those that act recklessly by ignoring the social
 distancing guidelines. I am disgusted that the Chinese are able to continue the barbaric wet markets and am also frustrated and suspicious by the amount of time this virus took to be declared a Pandemic. Most of all I am afraid.
