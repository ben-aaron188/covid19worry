I feel sad that I am away from people I love. I feel disappointed that not more is being done to stop the spread. I feel at peace in isolation. I feel proud of the NHS. I feel inspired by peoples creativity during this time. I feel the pandemic has been taken as a joke until it approached a persons native country. I think Donald Trump is putting millions of people at risk. I feel proud of Rishi Sunak supporting small businesses. My girlfriend misses me and I miss her. I am proud of my neighbour's daughter. He has corona virus and is a front line doctor.
