I’m worried about financial problems me and my partner now face, I.e him having to take a pay cut while I’m only getting maternity pay & wondering if we will lose the house and have to start from square one again! I’m scared for my 5 month old son and sad this has been the start of life for him! I’m also missing my family terribly, especially my mum who I’m extremely close to, I’m excited to be able to see her again when all this is over! I’m also really anxious for my friend and her family as her mother has contracted the virus and is currently in hospital recieving treatment, we are all hopeful she is going to pull through
