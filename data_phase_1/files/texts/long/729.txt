I feel fairly anxious about the coronavirus at the moment, although mostly about how it will affect other people. I have vulnerable family members that would be severly at risk to the virus should they catch it. It's stressful looking after them and helping them while they are in self isolation, especially with no clear end in sight for the outbreak. However, I am not personally very worried for my own health since I am in a very low risk group and self isolation has not been a very difficult adjustment.
