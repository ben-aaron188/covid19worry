I feel immense uncertainty. Its like this situation is either going to be quite bad, or much worse (with lots of collateral damage)if the authorities miss-manage it. It feels like people on the street are becoming paranoid and mistrusting of each other and if the current climate goes on for too long then I fear permanent/long-last damage to the social fabric. 
I also worry for the future. If this much havoc has been wrought by a moderately harmful Virus then it seems like something more severe could pretty much collapse modern civilization.
