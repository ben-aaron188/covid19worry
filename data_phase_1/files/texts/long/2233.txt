I find the situation very concerning. We have not reached the peak of it yet so it is very worrying. I am currently tly off work for the time being and I am starting to be worried about whether I will have a job in 3 months. At the moment the current news story I am watching is with regards to Boris Johnson being moved in to intensive care. Also earlier today I read that Pep Guardiolas mother has died of the corona virus. This is a depressing time for a lot of people around the world and one can only hope that people take heed of the advice given to stay indoors and keep their distance if they do have to venture outside.
