I lost my Dad to Coronavirus on Thursday. I'm heartbroken as he was so not ready to leave us and it was such a cruel way to die. I am beyond angry with the government whose actions and inaction I believe directly led to his death but I have no energy to do anything with my anger. I don't want to become another one of those bereaved families groups fighting for justice after the fact when so many more are going to needlessly die. I still don't think people realise the reality of the situation. It's heartbreaking to know how many other families are going through similar pain to us at this time. We can't even mourn properly as we can't get the hugs we need, the funeral will be a hollowed out shell, no reflective walks on the beach, no nothing.
