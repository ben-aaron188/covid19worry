i feel slightly relaxed, i have more time, but also more anxious bout the virus. i feel like it being dealt with in a good manner but it will still continue to get worse before it gets better. i feel scared as i live with an essental worker and we may be all at risk. although i do believe the government and society will come together and we will all defeat this together, im confident in this. i feel slight boredom being cooped up at the moment however, im running out of things to do and feel like im going insane
