Very worried for my family, anxious and panicked and wondering just when it`s all gonna end. Wondering if theres any light at the end of the tunnel and that if it`s ever gonna stop. Constantly worrying if my family is gonna get it. And also wondering how many more people are going to die and wondering what`s gonna happen to this country once it is all over, the economy, jobs, people, businesses and so forth. Sadness, A little bit of hope left but i dunno
Theres not really anymore I can say to be honest with you I mean what is their to say
