I am quite anxious about the Corona Virus. I have an elderly mother, she is 88 and has kidney disease. If she were to contract it I think it may kill her. Also I am 59 and have not written a will. If I die my personal estate would not pass to my partner. I intent to try and write a will using online services within the next few days. However my local community have been great at helping others. I  so happy to hear about all their selfless actions. We all need to help each other. Stay home, only go out for very essential things. Look after each other. And if you need cheering up then watch a film, read a book, listen to music, play with your pets and if youâ€™re really desperate download tik tok!
