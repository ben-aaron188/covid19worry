I find the corona virus very scary as I donâ€™t believe the UK are very equipped. We seem very reactive to the situation. I am a key worker therefore that makes me more scared. With the recent news that the prime minister is in intensive care that scares me even more as that means his case must be bad, and he has been very active in trying to keep people calm and safe however he got it himself. I feel very anxious at not being able to go outside as I am stuck in the house which I believe worsens my mental health.
