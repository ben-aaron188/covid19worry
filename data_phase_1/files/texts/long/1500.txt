I am worried - about the future, about livelihoods - both mine and others, about other people getting this virus and impacting their lives. It's difficult to live day to day without a timeline on when we may be able to return to some sort of normal. I miss being outside, I miss the my family and friends - and I am one of the lucky ones as I have my job, live with my partner and although having had some symptoms, I am perfectly healthy. I even miss my commute and being on the underground! I can't wait to have a pint in the beer garden of my local pub and I can't wait to hug my loved ones; I'm not normally a tactile person, but next time I see them, I'll make sure I give them a really long squeeze.
