I am frustrated and angry that people are still not social distancing and putting other people's lives at risk, however I am happy working from home spending time with my family, we are playing games and doing jigsaw, having old fashioned 
fun. However  I am worried about the spread of the virus and how many people have died. I am a person who shows emotion and am looking forward to being able to hug my Mum and Dad and other friends and family and having a big party. I did not vote for Boris Johnson however think he has done a good job with Covid19 and am concerned about his health as he is now intensive care
