I feel sad. I feel sorry for those who are treating patients, I feel sorry for those losing loved ones. I'm tired of certain politicians. I'm hoping that when this is all over the NHS will be properly funded and NHS staff properly rewarded. I fear for those in poorer countries.

I feel that those that have been inept at responding to this crisis, Trump I am looking at you, will be punished at the polls. I feel that this will be a massive wake up call to those who care too much about material possessions. I feel that for those who survive this, life will never be the same,
