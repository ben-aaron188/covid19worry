At the moment, I feel very worried that people are not taking it seriously enough, which subsequently means a lockdown will carry on for longer and longer. I also worry for my family in case they contract this virus or if a member of my family is carrying this virus without knowing. 

I also am a bit disgusted that some people are only putting more of an effort into their personal hygiene now due to a disease and didnâ€™t put any or much effort in to this beforehand. 

Times like these are the only times keyworkers or services such as the NHS or Emergency Services are receiving any sort of recognition, usually their work goes completely unnoticed.
