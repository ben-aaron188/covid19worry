I am worried about the situation with Covid-19 as I have just glanced at the news five minutes ago. I have family members who are key workers in the NHS and working around the virus every day. I worry about them, friends or other family getting the virus as it looks to be very serious. I also worry about the possibilities of myself having the virus at any time. 
As I am so worried I am quite tense and unable to relax. This means I am fidgeting and looking for ways to use up some energy, I don't feel particularly happy and am starting to feel a little bit sad,
