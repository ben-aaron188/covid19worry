some days I wake up positive but some days I don't want to get up as there's not much to look forward to in these current times. At this moment I feel tired and dejected, probably as a result of not sleeping very well. It is taking me longer to get to sleep at night at the moment. As a result I am very tired in the mornings. The one thing that is extremely good for my wellbeing is getting out to do a run daily...or most days. I am hoping that this will be able to continue and won't also be taken from us.
