It is a very worrying situation i am scared for my families health, i am worried about the economical factors this is likely to effect. I have lost my job due to the pandemic, one of my family members contracted the virus and was severely ill - he had high fever, bad cough and breathing difficulties, lucky they have improved. I fear that most of the British population do not understand the seriousness of the situation and it is likely to only get worse if we don't all work together to quarantine and avoid unnecessary social contacts.
