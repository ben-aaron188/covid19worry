I stated I felt number 8 in respect of anger and disgust and that is aimed at people who are still socialising with various people and are ignoring the lockdown rules at present. I did not state number 10 for these two because I suppose I empathise with their desire to keep mentally sane by seeing their family and friends but I feel they are being unfair because the more of us that keep to lock down rules, the more positive our future will be with respect to Corona and the death tolls rising. 

I am anxious for each oerson's future and what this holds, especially my daughter as she is only 8 years old and I can tell is constantly growing fear rapidly, the more and more we hear about the effects Corona is having on people daily, all over the world.
