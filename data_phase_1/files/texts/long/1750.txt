Itâ€™s very worrying and an anxious time. Makes me feel on edge about going out in public and about my health. I am Hoping That it passes quickly and people take notice of the governments advice and to isolate at home and to not go out. 

I am worried that I contract the virus and I pass it on to my family members and/or they become seriously ill or hospitalised. 

In addition I am worried for the safety of the public and there are further deaths. 

Please keep safe, people need to understand this message and ensure their own safety and their families safety is a key priority.
