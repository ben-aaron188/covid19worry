I feel relaxed as I am in isolation, my only worry is my family bringing the virus into the household as they go to work and to the supermarket, but as I’m not at work I feel very relaxed. I’m not stressed at all, but I do feel very bad for those who have been affected and scared for my elder family members. I feel more patriotic as it shows the whole country coming together but it angers me that some people think it’s okay for them to ignore the social distancing rules set by the government, these people aren’t above anyone else and they should face consequences.
