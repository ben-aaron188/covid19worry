I am afraid to lose any of family members. I don't want to live 24 hours a day with my wife anymore. I lost 2 business opportunities, I feel very bad about them.The government announced a support program which doesn't cover me because I opened my business 8 months ago (as a self employed). I am very disappointed due to this.  I really bored at home. I begin to dislike traditional Chinese who can eat everything which can move. On the other hand you didn't say that I need to write a text which must be 500 character at minimum, at the beginning. Yes you should say that before I start the survey.
