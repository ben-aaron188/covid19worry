I'm not overly concerned, I think I've accepted the problems and the sad consequences. I don't think there's much danger to the people that  I know. I'm able to work and exercise and speak to the people I care about. I mostly sad that I can't see my girlfriend and extended family, I've had to cancel two holidays and I'm disappointed.

I'm pleased that people have generally responded sensibly and tried to support saving lives. It does make me frustrated that there's lots of misinformation and that some people want to assign blame - I think it pushes as people's biases (including my own, I'm sure).

I think it's an interesting time and in some ways it's exciting to see the changes that have taken place and to identify the opportunities; but it comes at great cost.
