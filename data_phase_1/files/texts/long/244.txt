I feel sad that this is happening in the United Kingdom and the rest of the world and i completely understand why the government have taken the steps they have at this current time to keep us all safe. But also frustrated at the general public who don't seem to be listening to what is needed to keep us all safe! If we continue to do what we're doing we can out live this and get back to how we were before! I definitely think boris should be a little stricter to show the UK that he's being serious, and the lockdown is needed.
