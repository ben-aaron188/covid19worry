I am anxious for the world in general.  I am fearful for the health of my loved ones.  I am furious with the UK governments wilful avoidance of doing the right thing, I am furious that UK royalty can travel the country,. but ordinary people can't sit on a bench in their neighbourhood to catch their breath while out for a walk.  We are either all in it together and the fules apply to all or we are not. It makes me so concerned for the UK in general and my people in particular. One of my children at eighteen is having to live alone, so on top of his risk for coronavirus I am terribly concerned for his mental health, but my elderly father lives with me and the risk to his health by introducing another person into the mix is too much.  I feel only the rich will survive this.
