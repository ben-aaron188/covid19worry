Things seemed to get better as more people are getting vaccines, however I'm still worried about when international travel would return to normal. The restrictions on international travel differed from country to country, and there are fewer flights available for certain destinations. The existing restrictions may have bad impact on my plan of looking for a new job and/or moving to another country. It's not quite clear when and how the current situation would change. Moreover, I am curious about whether and when I would be able to get vaccinated in the UK.
