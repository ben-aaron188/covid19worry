Overall my worries about corona have are outweighed by the positive changes that have happened because of it. 
For example, spending a year working from home, having big events that I was dreading be cancelled. 
Now that the vaccine is being rolled out I'm hoping that some of these changes will stay, but not knowing what my working situation will be in the future is making me feel anxious. My company hasn't decided how many people will be allowed to work from home in the future. It's also had a negative impact on wages this year.
