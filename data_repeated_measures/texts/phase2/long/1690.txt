I feel like things are starting to get better. However, it is still important to remember the current situation we are in and how the past year has gone. It is still important to remain vigilant and follow guidelines in order to eliminate the virus. I am feeling antsy about when places will be able to re-open, as there are places such as hairdressers and non-essential retail that I would really like to be able to go to. I am looking forward to when places open back up, as the current lockdown has felt very long and exhausting. I am excited to be able to travel further, go to attractions, shops and travel again.
