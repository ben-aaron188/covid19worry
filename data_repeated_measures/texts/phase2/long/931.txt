I feel like the governtment screwed people like me and took away our income without giving anything back. It is ok though as I have found a way to make money that the government can't tax and I will continue to abuse it as long as the politions keep the loopholes open for themselves. The whole situation has been handled poorly and fishy snacks have shown that he will only help certain self employed people and the rest can suffer. The government has made it very clear with cum head that there is one law for politicians and one law for regular tax payers, so if you want to break rules and laws just become a politician and its fine
