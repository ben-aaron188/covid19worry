I feel indifferent about the corona virus at the moment.  I have heard of one conformed death where I can make some sort of connect with.  Mostly people discuss the inconvenience which is typical of the human race.  I feel fine- happy and healthy.  I worry about my parents, both pensioners who have a few health issues yet do not understand the gravity of contracting this terrible virus.  I have hope, hope for normality and safety for everyone.  I work in an environment surrounded by 100s of people.  In a secondary school, the kids do not fully comprehend the extent of their actions.  They do not isolate properly and have many novel ways of wearing face coverings.  Guidelines which fostered their partial immunity was definitely not a wise move.
