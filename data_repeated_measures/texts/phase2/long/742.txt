I feel slight optimist, a lot of the vulnerable and elderly have been vaccinated and deaths are low. However if angers me how the government and the media scare people. You have to look at it perspectively. Deaths are low compared to the population of the country, even the cases are low. So why not let open everything up? More than 20 million have been vaccinated. The chances of you catching it, and even dying now is slim as long as you're normal and healthy. I just can't work out why they won't let us go back to normal now? And with every inch of hope given to us (Road map out of lockdown) they seem to discover (or make up) a new scary variant to scare the public again. Take the South African variant. They made a massive deal out of it. We haven't heard fuck all about it since they tested everyone in the high areas. It all seems a bit fake to me. I just don't trust the media or this god awful government anymore.
