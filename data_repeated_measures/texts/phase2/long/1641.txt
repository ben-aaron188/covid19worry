At the moment I feel quite optimistic and relaxed about the corona situation. this is because i know the vaccine is accessible and things will be back to normal soon. I also feel that the situation has been over-exaggerated in the media, through only representing the bad figures and not any of the positives, such as the survival rate. it has made university more stressful, having to do it online and having online meetings. Right now i feel closer to my family, having had the opportunity to spend more time with all of us together
