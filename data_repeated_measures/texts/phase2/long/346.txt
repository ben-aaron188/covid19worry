I feel incredibly sad about the sheer amount of people who have lost their lives as a result of Covid 19. I also feel really angry and annoyed with the government for being too slow to react at the beginning of the pandemic and I'm I'm very annoyed at how they are refusing to give NHS workers the pay rise they deserve. I feel worried and scared about the new variants of the virus. I also feel very optimistic and hopeful about the vaccines stopping people dying of Covid in the future, even though I haven't been offered mine yet.
