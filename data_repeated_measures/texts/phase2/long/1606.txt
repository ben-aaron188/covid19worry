I feel hopeful now that vaccinations are underway and in particular now that vulnerable members of my family have been vaccinated. The Prime Minister's roadmap indicates that all restrictions should be lifted by July so I'm excited to be able to do things over the summer like see my friends and possibly even go on holiday. Though I am concerned about lifting restrictions prematurely. I'm still anxious to leave the house without a mask but I feel much more relaxed when out and about than I did a year ago.
