I think I'm acclimatised to the lockdowns and restriction of freedoms to the extent that if everything were to open up to quickly it would make me anxious. In terms of the disease, the vulnerable people I know are being vaccinated quickly which makes me less worried than I was last year. I have received both vaccinations due to my job so I am pleased about that. I would like to be able to plan things and travel but I am prepared to wait until it is safe to do so although I do find this frustrating.
