i feel angry at our government for making the situation worse than it should be. i am scared at my future, sad at my wasted year and worried that my future is messed up because of it. My late 20s have disappeared, all because our government don't listen to scientists. so many people needlessly died due to my corrupt government. I hoped it would even out inequality, yet its just made it worse. austerity will kill my country. i also worry all our human rights will continue to be taken away from us
