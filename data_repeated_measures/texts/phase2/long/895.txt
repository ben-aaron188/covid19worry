I feel slight anxiety about children going back to school on Monday. Even though I know they need to I'm worried that this will cause another surge in cases. People seem to break the rules now and are becoming more complacent now there are vaccines available and the end is supposedly in sight. People are desperate to get out of their houses and back to normal life but they need to pay attention to social distancing and mask wearing for as long as there are still cases.I am both looking forward to travelling again and working at work, but also worried about it!
