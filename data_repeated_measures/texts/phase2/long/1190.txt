I’m sick of being locked down for a virus that has a high survival rate for the vast majority of the population. 
I feel worried that I will be forced to take a vaccine that is as yet unproven to be effective at preventing the spread of corona virus or stopping someone from getting coronavirus. I’m also worried about how there is talk about making it difficult for those who chose not to take the vaccine to resume a normal life-it is unethical in my opinion to take away individual choice from a person to do as they wish with their own body.
I feel conflicted about it all because it is undoubtedly a tragedy for those who have lost loved ones but on the other hand, we are being asked to modify our lives for something that the majority of people will survive.
