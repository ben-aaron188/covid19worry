I feel okay because there is now a vaccine which seems promising and it is being rolled out at a fast rate in the UK which is great.
it seems like life may return back to some sort of normalcy in the near future and that is great. the announcements of slowly opening up restuarants and schools and so on is good to hear and i feel like i am looking forward to the future and potential travelling.
I do feel worried about the lack of uptake of vaccine in some communities and the inequalities arund the world when it comes to distrubuting the covid vaccine
