I feel that this situation is going to have repercussions for a long time ahead. There will be obvious economic consequences such as higher unemployment but there will also be social and health issues emerging for possibly a long time afterwards. This makes me slightly anxious about the wellbeing of society in general for the foreseeable future. There are the backlog of operations and treatments that have been postponed due to covid, there are the potential long term illnesses possibly due to covid and there is also the possibility of new variants of coronavirus evading the current vaccines that have been developed to prevent covid. There is a lot of uncertainty about the future.
