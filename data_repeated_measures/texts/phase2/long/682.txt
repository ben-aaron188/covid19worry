I feel fed up of it all as it has gone on for so long. I am fed up of others breaking the rules when I am putting myself at risk every day to work in a school and I haven't seen any of my family for a year. I am slightly optimistic for the future but I am always doubtful that the dates when restrictions will relax will go ahead. I don't want to get excited and then get my hopes up and feel disappointed. I am also very grateful that I am healthy and I am hoping that I do not catch coronavirus. I am excited to spend time with my friends and family again.
