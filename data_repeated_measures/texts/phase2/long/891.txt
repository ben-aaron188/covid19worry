I think people are hoping the vaccine will save everything and we can go back to normal before the end the year. This is not to be safe or sensible, we should learn from our experiences

People who I know that have had vaccine have only had mild side effects and are glad they were able to

I feel that the differing symptoms everyone has makes it hard to keep track of whether you may or may not have Covid. Always on edge if feel slightly under the weather now
