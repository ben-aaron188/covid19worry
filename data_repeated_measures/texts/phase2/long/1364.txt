Tired of the restrictions, and really wishing we didn’t have to live this way. Bored. Unfit. Exhausted by the extra pressure at work, with more to do, fewer people to it, and everything having to be done differently.  Frustrated by people flouting the rules, and appearing to think it doesn’t apply to them. Grateful to have had first dose of the vaccine and impressed by the speed of the roll out. Concerned about friends and family members. Desperate to be able to meet up with people and socialise again.
