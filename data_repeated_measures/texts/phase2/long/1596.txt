I am much more relaxed now than I was at the beginning of the pandemic. I feel safer knowing vaccinations are being rolled out, but I'm still not very comfortable leaving the house for unessential purposes. I worry more about the impact on my future, it took a while to adjust to life after the virus but I am prepared for it to take longer to readjust to life without masks or social distancing. I am hopeful that restrictions will be relaxed as promised by the government as the plans roll out.
