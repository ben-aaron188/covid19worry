I have mixed feelings about the coronavirus situation overall. I was surprised and saddened to see the the general level of stupidity and selfishness was much higher than I believed, even if they represent a minority overall. I never thought I would see ""anti-lockdown"" protests for example. I was also a little surprised to learn how much of a role political ideology factors in a countries overall pandemic response, both good and bad, and how unlikely it is that any real long term lessons will be learned to address any failings. At the same time, I'm heartened by the number of genuinely selfless and compassionate people, including medical and other critical workers, who have given so much with little thought to the their own risk.
