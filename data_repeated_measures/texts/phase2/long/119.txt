I feel like I have served my time and really want things to open back up again because I desire to do normal things and live a normal life where I'm not restricted. I am getting bored of being inside and a bit confused over what I can and can't do. I don't know if we will open the country up as quickly as the government hopes, so there's still uncertainty. I don't look back on the restrictions with much anger because I think I needed a break from the world as opposed to it being non stop and all go go go all of the time. I am in some ways grateful for what's happened, even though obviously it has devastated many people.
