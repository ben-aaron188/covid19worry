I am still very worried about the covid situation in the UK. I welcome the easing of restrictions but feel that it is honestly still too early to do so. I live in an area which is very popular for holidays and we have an elderly population who are extremely at risk once travel is allowed again. I am worried about my children going back to school and the chance they could be exposed to the virus. There are still too many cases and deaths in my opinion for us to be able to relax the restrictions now.
