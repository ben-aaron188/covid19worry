Anxious about schools returning and the possible impact on myself and my family. Hoping that the return to schools doesn’t increase infection rates.Frustrated that all teachers haven’t been vaccinated. Hoping that we don’t have to go back into lockdown. Looking forward to having a UK based holiday in the Summer. Aware that lots of people will want the same things as myself. Not sure when I will ever feel fully confident to return to large gatherings of people at Public events. Glad that people I love are beginning to get the vaccination.
