It's changed how I've lived my life for the past year, but it's done so because I chose to willingly follow the guidance from scientist. It's important that I helped stop the spread, and protected my family and friends from contracting it.

Despite doing this because I believe it's the right thing to do, it has caused anxiety and I haven't been able to go out much and see my friends. Now that vaccinations are being issued I hope things will start returning to how it was before, but I know it's still a long road. I hope that the current government learns from this when the next pandemic inevitably happens, and puts measures in place so we're prepared as a country.
