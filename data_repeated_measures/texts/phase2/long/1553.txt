I did start to relax and think that when the vaccines are here then we can go back to normal but I’m now starting to fear that we won’t. I feel that the government don’t seem as positive about when the lockdown ends and when the majority are vaccinated. I’ve also been anxious the last two weeks as my brother and his children caught coronavirus even though he had been careful. I’m also still suffering the effects of coronavirus from last March and am worried about having the vaccine and what effect it could give on top. My child also has multiple allergies so whether he can be vaccinated remains to be seen and if not I will always have that fear.
