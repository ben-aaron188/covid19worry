I feel anxious about coronavirus but also hopeful that things are getting better. Im relieved my parents who are both shielding are having their 2nd vaccine next week. Feeling that things are happening proactively rather than sitting helplessly.

I have some anger at those people who aren't abiding by the lockdown restrictions when the risks are still there.

I am happy that schools are back however my daughter is already complaining of a cold and sore throat - i am worried that its only a matter of time before the schools close again.
