It has dragged on for a quite while and I am eager to see it die down. There are some promising signs with vaccination and easing of lockdown, but I still remember how last year was looking promising as well initially. Hopefully, the economy will not be too badly affected in the immediate terms and we will be able to return to a relative normalcy. I am excited at the prospect of making future plans again and possible making steps to develop myself and my career. We will see, it is hard to make any predictions nowadays.
