Currently, I'd say I feel a mixture of happiness as well as anxiousness and worry as everything is beginning to go back to normal in phases, starting with schools. I'm fine with this decision, but there's something in me as well as the news I've read up on that tells me it's too early to do so and we'll soon be back to lockdown once again. I'm also still quite unsure about the safety of my child at school, which is currently making me quite anxious, and I'm sure other parents feel the same way. In addition, it makes me quite unhappy that this entire pandemic could've been dealt with in a much more professional way, and due to the government's unprofessionalism, many people have lost their lives. That being said, I'm glad the vaccine rollout has been a good success and hope it carries on this way.
