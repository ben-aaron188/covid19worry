I'm worried that I haven't been able to see my parents for months, and haven't seen my closest friends for 18 months now. My background anxiety levels have increased, how is it already March 2021, and we're in lockdown almost one year since this started in the UK.  I'm grateful to be able to work from home, but miss the contact in person with my colleagues.  We've lost 40% of our colleagues through redundancy as a direct result of the lockdown and the reduction in demand for hydrocarbons - and we're now having to cover the work previously done by those people who were made redundant, so I'm tired.  I've also lost a close friend to cancer in the last couple of months, and have felt robbed of seeing him during his last few months, and frustrated at not being able to give our mutual friends and his husband a hug at the funeral.  I just want a holiday, but a holiday that doesn't involve walking round the block, or sitting in the lounge.  A holiday that involves getting on a plane and visiting friends in the Azores, and I hate that we can't (sensibly) book anything for fear that we won't be permitted to leave the UK or enter Portugal.  The uncertainty of the future is frustrating...but the success of the vaccination programme is to be celebrated, and I can't wait until it's my turn to get the jab!
