I'm feeling less worried about it now than was before, especially as it seems now we have been through the worst of it. It's nice to know the end of it all is in sight and eventually life will go back to normal. However the idea of normality at the moment is quite overwhelming, and it's going to take a while to get used to it again. I'm worried about the job market as I graduated last year and am yet to find a job in something I want to do. I'm also worried about not having COVID as the excuse to not be able to do things or use when im putting something off.
