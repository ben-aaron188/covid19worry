I am really sad for the families that have lost someone. I am really sad for the amazing front line workers who have put themselves out there to keep us going. I am anxious about the future and what that means in the immediate future (the next year or so) but also about the next few years and us trying to make up for what's been lost.
I cannot remember a time when we as a nation were as divided. Brexit, the coronavirus, this is a scary and sad place to be right now. I look at countries like Australia and New Zealand, and their lives are almost back to normal now...then I just feel sad for us in the UK that we weren't led that way, and I feel anxious that life will never be the same as it was 'before.'
