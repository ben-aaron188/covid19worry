The current situation is still worrying as still a large number of in- hospital patients and infection rate is still high. After one year of home working, I start feeling bored and would like to return to the office, as I miss the interaction with my colleagues in the office. I also miss eating out at restaurants and travelling to different places. In general I'm optimistic about the future with the vaccine roll out and really hopeful of a proper summer holiday. I hope majority of people will take the vaccine so that our lives can return to normal.
