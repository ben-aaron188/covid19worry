Things are getting back to normal soon, very strange to think it's been a year. Life simar for me this whole time, less some social interactions and sports. Numbers look like we're headed the right way, will leave a big mark behind though. Excited to see people and to be more active too. People all around getting the vaccine, very promising so long as everyone complies. I haven't yet been offered it but of course will when I can. My area has continued to be one of the lowest rates of infection in the UK so has not been too worrying.
