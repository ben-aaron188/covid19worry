I feel very sad about the huge number of deaths in the UK. I feel like the government are doing a terrible job. The constant “leaking” information to the media is a disgrace. I feel lonely, and bored, and frustrated re lockdown. I feel worried that new variants are constantly emerging. I feel exhausted because my work is much harder working from home. I am worried about money because my partner has been made redundant. I feel sorry for all the businesses which have gone bust or will go bust in the future. I am desperate to get my hair cut and see my friends!
