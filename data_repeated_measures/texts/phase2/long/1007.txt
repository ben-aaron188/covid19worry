To be honest I feel fine. Work is ok as I'm working from home without problem. With this  lockdown boredom has been the biggest problem and has resulted in several disagreements with partner. Right now I feel sorry for my dog as we used to go for long walks every day, now we only go to the local park. Unusually I have found myself hungry much of the time and have eaten much more than normal, particularly crappy sugary snak foods or crisps. Thanks to snaking have put on almost a stone in last 3 months.
