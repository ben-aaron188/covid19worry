I feel anxious that it is affecting so many parts of my life. I feel even more anxious than my boss is expecting me to carry on as normal as work and break rules to do so. I am bored of life being this way and want to get back to some sort of normality. I am annoyed that I still follow the rules but others seem to do what they want to serve themselves. I am a little hopeful but still sceptical that the vaccine will help change things soon. I am happy that my parents have now had their vaccine as this was my main concern.
