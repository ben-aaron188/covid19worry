I feel ok. Somewhat bored of the situation but hopeful. It's been a long time since I have been able to see family and many friends but we have made good use of virtual catch ups. I feel sad for others. For example my nan who is in her nineties and gets little pleasure from life in the current circumstances. In many ways life feels more relaxed and less busy/hectic which is a change to my life that I'm quite happy with. I'm now used to 'new' habits and feel quite content. I'm a little nervous about the future. Even when rules are relaxed...I'm not sure how safe I'll feel hugging my nan for example. Working in education I'm worried that I will be a risk too great regardless of what the government say.
