I am angry about the way the government has continued to deal with the virus - we can clearly see other countries have made much better progress. I am also sad for what a year of missed opportunities means for many people, and the fact that it still seems unclear when life might return to normal. Even though my life hasn't been negatively impacted financially, I can see that in many of my peers it has and this secondary stress and concern for others makes the route out of lockdown unclear. I am also extremely worried about what the long term impact on other health care services may be, and people who have delayed diagnosis of other conditions for over a year now.
