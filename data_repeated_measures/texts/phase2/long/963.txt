I am quite relaxed overall though it is incredibly sad how many people have died during the pandemic and how many still dismiss everything as fake etc. The British government have generally been shambolic throughout, more concerned with profit than people. I have enjoyed certain aspects of the pandemic eg the slower pace of life and was hoping for a ""new"" beginning post pandemic. However, i have little faith that humanity will learn anything and will probably soon revert back to the same bad old ways that got us into this mess in the first place.
