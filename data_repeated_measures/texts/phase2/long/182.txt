I am feeling  a little easier with the pandemic as with the vaccine now rolling out there is hope that we can now see the end of it. I still dont like going to the shops though as people are getting careless and seem to think it's all ok now. I feel angry with people and people I know that have never really took the pandemic very seriously and gave continued in almost the same manner as before, when I have tried to  abide by the rules and haven't seen my family for months. Life will slowly move forward and we can start to l8ve again and socialize with friends and family.
