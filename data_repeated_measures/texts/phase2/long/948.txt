I think we need to move on.  We need to get the economy moving again and we need to get the young people back out there.  I feel so sorry for them, they have lost so much.  More and more people are being vaccinated so we should start to ease lockdown now and do it faster.  I have had my vaccine and it knocked me out so I understand how serious the virus is but I think the vulnerable should be made to shield (which a lot aren't doing) thus allowing school kids and teenagers to live their lives.
I feel so sad that my daughter in her second year at University has had her time ruined.  She will never get this time back. 
I am currently looking for work but until the economy gets back on its feet there is little out there.  This is causing increasing concern.
