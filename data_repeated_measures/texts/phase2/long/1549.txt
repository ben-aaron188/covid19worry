Overall I am not very worried about the current situation as there has been several other diseases that have had the same effect on humanity, I think the severity was blown massively out of proportion, whilst it is still important to be aware, the lockdown situation has lasted way too long. I think that the government has handled it really well regardless of all of the negative comments from the labour supporters as it is a never before seen disease and no government would have been able to prepare for it given the time frame they had especially with the border traffic we have as a country
