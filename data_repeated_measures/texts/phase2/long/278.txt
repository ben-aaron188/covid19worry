To be totally honest, I've been utterly miserable this year. Not seeing friends, family and doing the outgoing things I enjoy. Mental health took its toll for certain and I'm just numb now.
Scared for myself.
I'm not sure I will adjust to normalcy easily, but then again I don't know what normalcy is anymore.
I had such big plans for 2020, and they all came crashing down for me and made me feel oh so small.

My life seems like a distant blur at the current time and I'm not sure where I can go from here, I'm not getting much support.
