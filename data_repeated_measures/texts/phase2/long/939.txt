I think because we have lived with it for over a year now it feels like a way of life and as there is a light at the end of the tunnel with vaccinations it feels like things are getting a little better. I am looking forward to getting back to normal but I know that this will take a bit more time also. I am looking forward to spending some time with family and being able to visit my parents house without worry. It has been hard and my mental health has not been great with it and I try to be optimistic
