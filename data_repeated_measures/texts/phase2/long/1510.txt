not worried about covid itself anymore just fed up with lockdown itself and want to be able to get on with my life. being away from friends and family for so long has made me quite lonely and feel a bit more socially awkward than i did before. I do feel a bit relieved though and hopeful that the worst of the pandemic is over and there is some light at the end of the tunnell

 the good thing is thats its made me appreciate more what is truly important in life and i will appreciate this more in the future
