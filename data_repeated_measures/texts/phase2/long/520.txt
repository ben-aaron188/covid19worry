I'm much less worried about the actual virus compared to the start of the pandemic but I'm very worried about what the economy and the current gigantic debt will mean for my generation. I feel a bit frustrated how it will probably be us who has to clean up all the mess now even though statistically we should be the least at risk group. My partner is on furlough at the moment and has been forced to seek new employment and I'm just worried about the uncertainty of the future. I guess I'm a bit angry as well at the absolute lack of leadership that the government has demonstrated throughout. I find it disgusting how some people would take this opportunity to further their own political agendas without real or apparent regard for what's right for the general public. Particularly the PM's conduct and attitude towards the entire thing has just been plain embarrassing. I guess I'm a bit sad as well because I'm pessimistic about the future of UK, with Brexit going on as well and whatnot.
