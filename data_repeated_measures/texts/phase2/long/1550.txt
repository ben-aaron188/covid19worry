The uk government is lucky that the vaccination is going well and they have been able to avoid a dire situation getting even worse. cases and deaths  are going down to due to the vaccinations, which the government has had little input on. The government has mismanaged the pandemic by bring in measure that arenâ€™t strict enough too late, and we are in a better place now but that is due to luck rather than a competent government 
I feel hopeful that we might be closer to normal by the end of the year but I do think we might have to lockdown again in the winter months as new variants emerge
