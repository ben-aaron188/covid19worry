I am optimistic about Corona virus and I am looking forward to receiving my vaccine. I believe that if everyone gets the vaccine we can fight this virus. Those people who refuse it are putting others at risk. I feel it is are duty to protect one another. I am not scared of the virus and I feel everything will work out right. I have happy that in the knowledge if I did catch It I would be well looked after within our health service. I do feel sad for all those that have suffered and those that have lost someone because of the virus.
