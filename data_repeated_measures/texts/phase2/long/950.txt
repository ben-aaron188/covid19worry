I feel that the current situation was avoidable and that the handling could have been better. Quite frankly I’m fed up of the situation and want it all to be over so that I can forget about it. My life has been on hold since last March because of the coronavirus and it has seriously delayed my long time plans and also disrupted my final year and university and my planned graduation. 

Every day feels like a repeat of the day before so much so that I often forget what day it is as it’s not relevant anymore
