This evening I received a tip off from a friend that people over 56 can now book a vaccination online, so I did that immediately and now have appointments for the 1st and 2nd vaccination booked.  Hence I am feeling personally very happy, but nevertheless appreciate that we are still in a serious situation with 'normality' a long way off.  As I am retired (early) and live alone, I don't have the worry of mixing at work (as a former teacher I am glad not to be facing the stress that the return on Monday may pose for my old colleagues) and have been able to limit contact with others.
