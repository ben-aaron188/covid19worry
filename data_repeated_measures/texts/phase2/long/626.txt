Absolutely disgusted that almost a year later we are still in lockdown, our Governments have failed us by not getting things right from the start  living in Scotland we have no route out of this announced to us and myself and everyone I speak to believe  we need to learn to live with the virus. We have no key dates to look forward to other than the end of April going back to the tier system that we were in last year. We have been unable to travel to see family outwith our council since September and its beyond a joke.
