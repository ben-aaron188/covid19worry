I feel much more relaxed compared to the start of the pandemic. However, I think this is a fake sense of relaxation as there is still risk of COVID which makes me more anxious. I am also worried about life getting back to normal now that the pandemic is almost over. I now worry about not being worried enough about the virus. However, I am still concerned about restrictions which prevent me from seeing my friends and family. Still my main concern is the health and wellbeing of my family. I also continue to worry about spreading the virus without realising.
