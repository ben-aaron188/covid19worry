I feel positive as am looking forward to having the vaccine. My elderly telarives have had their first jabs. I am hoping the Government can relax the lockdown restrictions and that shops will reopen in April as per the roadmap. I hope my daughter can return to university next term.  I am worried about returning to work and commuting and hope to continue to work from home fir a few days a week. I am worried about the impact on the economy and what retail and hospitality will look like in future.
