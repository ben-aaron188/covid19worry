I had a vaccination this week and I fell less anxious about coronavirus.  Overall, 2 days after the vaccination, I don’t feel well; my arm hurts and I have experienced head ache all day.  I will isolate for a further 3 weeks until I feel more secure.  I am totally fed up with being in lockdown.  I miss my family and there is little joy in life. The biggest part of my day leaves me suffering acute boredom, I haven’t enough to do and I tend to snack far too much.  I feel more hopeful for life after lockdown and feel the government has produced a sensible road map out of this situation.
