With the vaccine going well and the hospitalisations falling I am starting to relax more about the actual disease itself. I think the release from lockdown is slow and the economy should be given the chance to restart now. The longer everything is shut, the longer it will take to recover and more people will lose their jobs.
I personally just want to go to work and return to some sort of normality, I need it for my wellbeing and for financial reasons. I have been on furlough for the best part of a year and it has honestly been the worst year ever, the worry of thinking whether or not I would ever return to work.
