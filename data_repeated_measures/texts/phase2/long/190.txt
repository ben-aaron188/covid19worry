Feeling anxious and worried but slightly optimistic that we might be able to move to something closer to normality in the next few months. Worried that life will never be the same and we will be apprehensive about going out and mixing for a long time. Worried about the affect the situation has had on the economy and how the country will recover. Worried about catching the virus when we are so close to being vaccinated. Anxious to see an end to lockdown and going out to shops and cafes again. Worried about long term effect on mental health of everyone.
