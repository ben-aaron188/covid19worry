I feel a lot more relaxed about the corona virus situation now.  This is because it has become normal to me and also I have recently had the vaccine.  It rarely crosses my mind nowadays and the only thing that worries me is lockdowns and not being able to meet people.  I have concerns about family members who have not received the vaccine yet but I know in due course they too will be vaccinated.  I would like to see the world go back to normal and crows be in football grounds and to be able to go to the pub and things like that.
