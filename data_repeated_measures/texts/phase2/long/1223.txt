I am happy with the current remote working situation due to corona. I can keep working from home for the rest of my life. 
Yes corona restricted our social lifes, but still not bad. Lockdown rules are a bit strong. They can loose it a little more. Therefore, we could meet with friends. But thank God, I live with my friend, thus I can talk with him. That would be worse if i was living alone. 
Parks and markets are crowded. People try to be careful, but tehir actions not adequate. Especially, last weekend there was sun shining in North West. Everyone was out, walking, sitting at the park. But they were too close to each other. A new wave is possible due to last weekend.
