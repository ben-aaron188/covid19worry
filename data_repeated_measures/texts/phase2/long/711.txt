I feel very anxious about the corona situation in that I just want life to return to normal. When it all first happened last March, it was new and unfamiliar. Communities came together, less traffic was on the roads, the weather was lovely. But now, it’s been too long, people have lost their jobs, children have missed so much schooling, and a lot of people I believe, have had enough. Me included. I want to be able to go to the cinema, to meet my friends for a coffee and lunch, I don’t want to wear a mask anymore. I get so sad when I think about elderly and vulnerable people all alone or poorly. I want to help them. And each time the government mentions new measures, such as easing ,lockdown, I worry that we will all build our hopes up only to have them shattered. What if we come out of lockdown too soon and we’ll have to go back in it again? I feel anxious all the time worrying, please everyone, stick to the rules, let’s get out of this situation
