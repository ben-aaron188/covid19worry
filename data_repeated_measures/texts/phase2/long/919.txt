I feel ok about the coronavirus at the moment. I think I was feeling a lot more anxious this time last year about the spread of COVID. A year on and I still do not personally know anyone who has died from COVID. I think lockdown 3 has been the hardest on me but also on a lot of other people too. It's been a difficult start to 2021 but I'm feeling more confident in the roadmap out of this third lockdown and with the vaccine too that we will soon be out of this mess and getting back to some sort of normal. I'm missing seeing friends and family and going out for dinners and a year on it's even tougher on people as it's been such an unsocial year.
