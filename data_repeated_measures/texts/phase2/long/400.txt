I feel like we are heading into a new phase and am looking forward to things starting to open up such as hospitality and particularly the cinema and I am very relieved that schools are opening again. I am pleased not to having to home school anymore. I have had my first vaccine so am feeling a bit safer than I was previously. All in all I am looking forward to things returning to normal but at the same time very aware of the fact the virus is still being spread.
I am dismayed by the government and their handling of this crisis.
