I feel worried for my family and friends and I sometimes fear for them as they are very irresponsible. I hope they are well and always pray for them. I currently though am doing well and I am not myself scared of corona mainly because im very young and healthy. I do have a young child who doesnt really understand it all very well but I hope in the future she will understand why we make precautions for her.
I feel extremely excited to be able to enjoy this summer on June 21st when lockdown ends completely. I will 100% take the vaccine too as I believe it benefits us all
