I'm optimistic about the future really. I have a job that is Covid proof as I work in the custodial industry so it has not effected me too badly. Apart from a small drop in money over the past few months that is now getting back to normal. The vaccine is rolling out so I am positive about the future and feeling we now have a grip on this awful virus. I just hope people will do as they said in the beginning and not forget about the people on the front line who sacrificed so much. Cleaners etc but I fear all their efforts will be forgotten and they will go back to being the invisible people of our society once again
