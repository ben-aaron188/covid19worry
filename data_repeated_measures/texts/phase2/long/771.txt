Its giving me anxiety especially with this new vaccine they come out with. I do not want to take the vaccine but I believe in the end everyone is going to be forced to take it. Its just been tested recently. We do not know if ifs gonna cause long term effects later on in life. I also do not believe the government and am convinced the world is run by sick people who just want to make money. They want people to die so they create illnesses. Then they create a ""vaccine"" that's gonna ""cure"" us but that's not true. If we all get cured and no one is sick how are they gonna make money? They want us ill. They want us to be like sheep following blindly. Anyways, thank you for joining my TED talk.
