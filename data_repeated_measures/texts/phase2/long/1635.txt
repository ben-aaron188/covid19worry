I feel more hopeful about it considering there appears to be a light at the end of a tunnel. I am very tired and mentally drained as lockdown has taken its toll. I have friends and family who support me and I’m still struggling mentally - I don’t know how people lacking a support group must be coping. I am worried about my family catching it but the vaccine has alleviated those worries slightly. I just want something to look forward to. I feel I’ve lost a portion of my youth to COVID that I’ll never get back.
