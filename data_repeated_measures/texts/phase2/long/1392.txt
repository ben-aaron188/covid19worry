I feel very uneasy about the lockdown situation.  I know that it's to minimise the contagion rate and whilst I'm fearful of contracting the virus, I'm equally concerned of the impact of my mental health.  My mental health is suffering with a lack of social interaction and normalcy in seeing people and living life.  I feel like I am totally ready for restrictions to be lifted (and with precautions such as masks) but i feel as though it's time to begin to lift restrictions and allow a semblance of normalcy to resume.
