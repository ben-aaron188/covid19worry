I have become accustomed to life with Covid. There are many negatives, such as not being able to see family and friends or not going on a holiday. Luckily, no-one of my close family or friends have become seriously ill or died. However, some benefits have also emerged. Fewer social obligations, working from home, and seeing the kids more as they are home schooling. I look forward to the end of the pandemic, but I also fear having to go back to a pre-Covid rat-race. This may seem selfish given the cost in lives and to the economy, but I hope we have at least learned that a different way of working and school is possible.
