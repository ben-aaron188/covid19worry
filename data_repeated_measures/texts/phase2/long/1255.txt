I am not very worried about corona as I feel like I won’t suffer with it to an extreme if I caught it. Many people I know suffered but overcame it. I still take precautions and completely avoid public transport. I drive or walk everywhere and feel okay about it.

I am fed up of the whole thing though, and can’t wait until it’s all over. I am fed up of the whole thing though, and can’t wait until it’s all over.
