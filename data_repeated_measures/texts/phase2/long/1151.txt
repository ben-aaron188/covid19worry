I am concerned about the reopening of schools and what will happen if the virus peaks again. I am also worried about the future and reopening shops and pubs. I cannot see how we can go back to anything like normality and this really worries me. A close family member wants me to go to a funeral with them and I am very concerned about that  both for me and for them. I am also concerned about having the injection although I know that having it the correct thing to do. i understand people being worried about having it but I think we all need to do the right thing for society.
