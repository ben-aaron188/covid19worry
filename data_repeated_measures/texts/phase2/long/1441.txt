I’m worried about my Dad who is not willing to take the vaccine, also worried about my Mum who wants the vaccine but doesn't want to have to put up with Dads complaints if she takes the vaccine.

I’m worried about my sister-in-law who has been working on the Corona ward for the past 8 months and questioning her decision to be a doctor due to the situations she's been stuck in.

I’m anxious cause I haven’t left the house in a year and I might have to soon… how am I going to cope with people again?

I’m hopeful that an end to this is in sight but also worried that the virus might mutate again, making the vaccine useless and enforcing a new lockdown.
