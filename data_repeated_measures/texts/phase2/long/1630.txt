Hopeful that this is the last full lockdown. Anxious as to what the new normal will be like and how we will all adapt. Feels good that the vaccine is being rolled out. Although that's the only part of the UK Covid situation that seems to be positive. Will we be expected to just go back to normal? It feels like we might and people are going to struggle with that. The effects of this will be long lasting as so many have lost family and friends. Jobs and livelihoods don't exist. The government have done such a poor job to date. I can't imagine another lockdown. People don't follow the rules anymore compared to at the start. There's so much apathy
