I’m just fed up with it all. It’s been going on so long now and I just want everything to be back to normal. It’s so frustrating because this time last year it was just starting and I never thought it would go on this long. I hope everything can get back to normal by June as planned. I’m skeptical though! I’m worried the timeline will be extended! My toddler hasn’t been able to go out and see other children and play like we would have done. I’m going to make sure we do so many activities together!
