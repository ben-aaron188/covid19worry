The problem is not that I particularly want to do anything that I am not allowed to do it is that I don't have the choice of being able to do it. So, I can't go for a walk in the woods IF I wanted to. It is like having a car. I generally use public transport if time is not an issue, but by owning a car I can go door to door exactly when I want to. Living under lockdown has not been too arduous, we have switched to home delivery of everything we need and are able to take local exercise up and down our little crescent. Going to collect our prescribed medecines at the local chemist is our only contact with the outside world but we are not lonely.
