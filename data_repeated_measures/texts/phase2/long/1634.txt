I think that the lockdown is being lifted too soon, especially when it comes to schools. I think that we should wait for more people to be vaccinated before things begin to go back to normal. If schools have to go back, then I think that teachers should be vaccinated as they are being exposed to high quantities of people and so should be protected. I am worried that the lifting of lockdown will lead to there being a higher infection rate again, which could lead to another lockdown that would continue to worsen the country's situation.
