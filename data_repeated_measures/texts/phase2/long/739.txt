I feel tired and frustrated - they would have been my first choices for current mood! My daily life hasn't changed as much as other people (I am a practice nurse so have worked throughout - no furlough), but I haven't seen family much outside of work (I live alone) so my workplace has become my family and social life - for better and for worse! We are taking our frustrations out on each other now. My feeling of 'anger' which I selected is more today than generally - I've just done a grocery shop and found people in the shop just didn't care, refusing to wear masks and complaining when asked by staff to wear a mask.

At the beginning I admit to even feeling a bit excited, although that sounds terrible - it was horrifying but also fascinating to be nursing through a pandemic and to be part of a huge group effort across the NHS. I enjoy the scientific aspect of medicine and health and was genuinely interested by what was happening, in a detached way.

Now I just feel tired.
