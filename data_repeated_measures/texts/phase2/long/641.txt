The Corona situation may be improving because the COVID-19 vaccine has been developed now. There may be less spread of COVID-19 because some people have taken the vaccine. There may also be less spread of COVID-19 because more people have followed the guidelines of working from home where possible, social distancing, wearing a mask. So there are positive steps that are happening for the Corona situation where the spread of COVID-19 has reduced. I have concerns for some NHS workers and frontline workers especially minority workers including religious minorities such as Muslim people or ethnic minorities, who may have to work more on the frontline with patients.
