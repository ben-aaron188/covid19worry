I’m kind of tired. I run my own business, and although we’ve been fortunate and survived without too much damage, the constant need to adapt and change our operations from day to day has been very wearing. I’ve also lost a family member to COVID, so that’s sad, and frustrating because it need not have happened. I’m looking forward to getting out, travelling, seeing people I haven’t seen for a long while, getting back to my work as it should be. Overall I’m hopeful that things are starting to get better now, but I also hope that doesn’t mean the mistakes, hypocrisy and mismanagement get forgotten.
