I’m scared of the thought of ‘normality’ not becoming relating for a while. I’m annoyed because selfish people are prolonging out chances of this. I can’t wrap my head around the fact that some people think they’re exempt from the rules and are still going out and doing as they please like Coronavirus doesn’t exist. But overall I’m very lucky because I’ve been able to continue going to work which has given me a routine to stick with, allowing me to still look forward to weekends and time off. I’m grateful that I’ve been able to spend this time with my family, however now being able to see my boyfriend has been quite sad, but it makes me more excited for the time that we can spend together when the rules change.
