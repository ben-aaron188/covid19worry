At this very moment, I am very bored of the situation. It is beyond tedious now, though I do understand why all the necessary procedures and lockdowns are in place. With people seemingly flouting the rules, it is understandable that this will not be the final lockdown and for that... all this is rather tiresome. 

I have desire for an optimistic and positive future, but cannot wait for ""things"" to get moving again. There is still too much unknow for the future and life does need to get back to some sort of normal again for the economy and county as a whole to keep on ticking again.
