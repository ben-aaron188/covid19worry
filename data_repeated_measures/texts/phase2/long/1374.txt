I feel annoyed at the handling of the coronavirus in the Uk and that we have been subjected to a third lockdown. I feel sad and concerned for all the children and families stretched to breaking point over school closures. I am not worried about catching the virus at all, I am more worried about the effects of lockdown. At the same time I feel very luck to have had my kids in school and to live in a house with a garden near a park and the sea and realise how lucky I am. I feel very grateful to have a job and to be earning money, as this time last year I was unemployed and very worried about money and finding it very difficult to be at home 24/7 with no space. I feel optimistic about the future though normal life still seems very far away.
