At this present moment I'm feeling anxious about the easing of restrictions within the UK. I don't know how it will go and worry that things will get bad again. It's also preventing me from planning things and having something to look forward to. Although we have the date of June 21st for restrictions to be lifted, I don't think we'll stick to that date. I also feel sad for all of those who have lost their lives due to the governments incompetency. If we had acted like other countries and had a proper lockdown early on, we wouldn't have lost as many lives.
