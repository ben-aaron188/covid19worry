I feel frustrated that people are still flouting the rules. My workload is ever increasing and I am tired all the time. I am angry that people still believe it is a hoax. Iâ€™m glad people are taking the opportunity to have the vaccine and that the overall numbers are decreasing. I feel like we have a long way to go though before anything truly starts to feel almost normal again. I am excited to see my family again as it has made me feel quite lonely. I have found my anxiety has been better recently but it still become bad at moments.
