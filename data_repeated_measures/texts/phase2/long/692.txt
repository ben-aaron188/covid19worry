I feel that getting everyone vaccinated is paramount now, and that governments need to cooperate to make medicines available to all.  Locally, there is a low rate of coronavirus at the moment but I also feel there is a lot of complacency which makes further outbreaks inevitable.

I feel that the UK situation as a whole is improving but considering it has been dire for the last few months it's not a great improvement.

I am still afraid for myself and my family, I think the government needs to do more to support people and businesses.
