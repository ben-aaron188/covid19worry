The situation seems to be improving because of vaccinations, but there's a lot of cause for concern about smaller countries having access to vaccines. Vaccinating the planet will be crucial in stemming further Corona mutations, which are already happening in Brazil. I'm upset, frustrated and angered that over 130,000 British people have died and nobody in government has resigned or said sorry and the Tories are remaining high in the polls. It's mind boggling that so many selfish greedy choices have been made at the cost of human lives and nothing has been learned or done but a lot of Tory donors have been enriched.
