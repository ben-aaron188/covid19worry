I feel very sad as my grandfather has recently died after contracting covid in a nursing home. I have anxiety about my grandmother  staying healthy and I am sad about not being able to see her and I am also very sad about not seeing my five year old nephew who I am very close to. I am also very worried about my dad as he has asthma and in the past had pneumonia so I am anxious about him. I am thankful to all the doctors, nurses and shop workers, school workers, everyone on the front line who has gone to work every day and looked after the country.
