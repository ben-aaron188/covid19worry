I’m based in the U.K. so pretty excited about things opening up on 21 June. I don’t even want to think about how I would feel should that not happen because I’m tired by this whole situation, and so very tired of being sad and tired. I’m looking forward to seeing friends, not being so cautious all the time, seeing colleagues, getting dressed up, and dating. I sometimes find myself angry and weepy for no real reason then remember, there is a reason - the constant shadow of a global pandemic and still being inside twelve months later is more than enough of a reason to be angry and weepy.
