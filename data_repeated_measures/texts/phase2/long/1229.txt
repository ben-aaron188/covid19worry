my current feelings on Corona virus is very up and down at the moment one minute I feel fine the next I feel panic or fear. Nothing seems normal at the moment it's all the same the days all mould into one and there's no differentiation between them. I just want this virus to disappear so we can alll live normally again but that seems far from reality right now. I think the government needs to get the vaccine out as soon as possible so we can all get out and go about our lives like we used to
 There's hardly any jobs that are working full time only the essential ones we all need to get out and try and save the economy as quickly as possible or there isnt going to be n economy to save. I wish this would all be over and done with so that we can all be normal nothing about this virus is normal it seems to go from one extreme to the next.
