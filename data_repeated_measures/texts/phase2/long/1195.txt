At this point I do not care much for the virus. Emotionally it did not bother me much from the beginning but I recognized that it is a dangerous threat. Now I do not even know how many cases there are or what restrictions are lifted/enacted and I am not interested enough to check. I work from home, but otherwise I live my life as usual, try to go for a long walk daily and for groceries twice per week. 
I am not interested in eating out or other aspects of having social life, so lockdowns do not bother me much
