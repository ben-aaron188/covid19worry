I've felt quite disgusted all the way through with the way the government has handled the situation. Poor choices have been made  at certain times and I think there has been more emphasis on keeping the economy going, rather than saving lives. The track and trace system was a joke, border control was a joke...the government has relied too much on people to do the right thing...there should have been much more stricter measures throughout. Anyone with a brain would know that if you let University students go back, then the virus is going to spread further across the country or that 24 hour shopping in London is encouraging ppl to use transportation...I feel disgusted that the government are so stupid here...can you believe that P.P.E was bought in the thousands that didn't even meet safety standards...from another country, when we had companies struggling here and needing the work. It's all been a joke from my 
Out of view ! I think now...everyone needs to be so careful, as we have being able to contain this in our sights...but if the 3rd wave comes here and we haven't vaccinated our younger people in time, this will created strains that will evade our vaccinations even more...as younger people have better immune systems and the virus will adapt to take hold. It is a race against time to vaccinate or we could have a bigger problem on our hands with mutations.
