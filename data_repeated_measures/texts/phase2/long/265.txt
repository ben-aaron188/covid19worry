i am worried with the opening up of the country that the virus numbers will rise with more varients arising and more people being ill.
Its hard to know how we are ever going to get back to a normal way of life, and I can see this going on for over a year with different countries re-infecting us.  I have a young grandson that we have never had over for the day or to stay, and when my daughter returns to work it is going to be difficult for everyone, people will stop taking as good a step to make sure they dont get it, if they are vaccinated they wont be so concerned with not catching it
