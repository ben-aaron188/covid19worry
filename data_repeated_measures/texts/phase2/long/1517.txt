I am relieved that we seem to be coming to the end of the pandemic with the vaccine. But very angry that the UK government has handled the matter disastrously with blatant corruption and this has resulted in unnecessary death and hardship and yet it seems to be riding high in the polls. I hate this country and as a 30 year old Brit feel I have no future here. Housing costs are ridiculous and only increasing, while work precarity is now the norm and living standards will continue to go down for working class people. Yet no one seems to care and selfish bastards keep voting for the Tories, who will probably be in government for another decade. And Keir Starmer only offers more of the same.
