I think the main thing I feel with COVID at the moment is fatigue.  I work in healthcare and it has been one incredibly long slog to get to this point.  I also feel an enormous sense of trepidation and uncertainty about the coming months, as healthcare workers will continue to have to work extremely hard to deal with the backlog of care caused by COVID while the rest of the world will go back to normal.  I worry that the sacrifices and struggles of me and my colleagues will be forgotten as the rest of the world gets back to normal.
