I am worried about the whole situation getting worse again. I don't trust the Government's road map or the Government in general. People around me are making plans for the opening up already but I feel it's too soon to know anything. I feel some hope and optimism but that Hooe is tempered by all my negative feelings.
I'm more worried me or my husband catching the virus now than I was at the start because of long covid and the unpredictability of it all. Previously I was more focused on my parents and in-laws but they have been vaccinated now. I'm also worried about the new variants that keep popping up and the possibility that we'll have to start all over again with the vaccine. 
I'm bored and frustrated by working at home and feel ineffective because of it. 

I miss my friends and feel my life chances have been significantly impacted - my husband lost his job in August and now had a temporary one which has prevented us from getting a mortgage. I feel like my chances of having a child have also been affected as I am taking medication for my mental health and haven't been able to access the support I need to start to come off it. The medication would potentially hurt the foetus and I can't add that to the other risks of having a child at my age would bring.
Overall I know we are a lot better off than lots of other people but it's been a slog. We've been locked down since November in our area and I haven't seen my parents or my friends in my home town since September.
