I am bored and depressed feeling trapped from something i view as low risk to myself and my peers. Money is the biggest issue. I feel that the pandemic has really highlighted a lot of health problems within our society. I am not concerned about catching the virus as my age group is low risk. I am hoping lockdowns end very soon as i feel mental health problems are much worse than covid19 in the long run and society will have more poverty as a result. I also feel fed up and tired and unmotivated and stressed as a result of lockdown and the media scaremongering and people being hysterical and over the top whenever someone disagrees with them on the topic.
