Following the UK's statistics online, I'm very pleased that the numbers of deaths and infections are reducing dramatically. Every day it's a relief to see the lives that are being saved by both the lockdown and the vaccine rollout. I am anxious about variants that circumvent current vaccine efforts and that I as a younger person will not see the vaccine for a few months yet. I am still sad for all of those who continue to lose their lives every day - even when the deaths are as low as 100 a day, it's a tragedy that they are occurring at all.
