I have been shielding for a full calendar year. I had my first baby while in lockdown, and was also made redundant due to Covid just before I gave birth. However, me and my loved ones all recently had the vaccine. I feel hopeful for the first time in a year. A huge weight of fear and anxiety has lifted. I no longer feel terrified when one of us coughs. I am so excited about the possibility of doing normal things again like going to the supermarket, and for my family and friends to finally meet my baby girl. There were so many points in the last year when I wasn't sure if we would ever get a vaccine or if we did, that it would happen so soon. I am so grateful for everything I have and can't wait to live my life again.
