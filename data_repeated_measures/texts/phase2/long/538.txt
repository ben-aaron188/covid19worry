I am sad that Covid-19 is so relentless. Perhaps it will be like the Spanish 'Flu of 1918-20 or the Russian 'Flu of 1889-90 (which could have been a coronavirus) and just drift away. However, the economy, education of our children, businesses and jobs have all suffered due to the pandemic. I am surprised that this was allowed to happen despite the warnings of the Bill Gates TED talk of 2015 and Event 21 of 2019. I was also very surprised at the transmission rate.
It seems that economic constraints have now been placed on the UK for many years to come and there is still uncertainty as to the efficacy of vaccination. I am also concerned that masks and social distancing will weaken the population's immunity to other illnesses.
