I feel exasperated by the situation. Work restrictions are increasing and it feels like things are continuing to get harder. I feel more hopeful about my personal life than my work life currently. I worry that the lifting of restrictions will be delayed repeatedly and impact on how hopeful I feel. I am trying to be excited for the future but it feels like nothing will ever change. I don't miss all parts of normal life but I miss a lot of them. I am exhausted by covid at this point. It currently feels more real than ever.
