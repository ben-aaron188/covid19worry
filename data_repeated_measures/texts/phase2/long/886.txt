I feel optimistic that the most severe impacts of coronavirus have been felt and that there is some light at the end of then tunnel for a return to normality.  That optimism is tinged with a little sadness at having seen my 2 boys go back to school today, ending a really unique period of time in my life when I have been able to be active and fully involved in their education and learning.  I am looking forward to picking up some normality, inparticular I am keen to see family members whom I have not seen for a considerable length of time now and it is good to have some visibility around when we may be able to do that.
