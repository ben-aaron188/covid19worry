Currently I am not too worried about the virus itself as I have not encountered it, even whilst I’ve been attending work. I am more angry with people not following the rules properly as they’re hindering the chance of things going back to normal and I am anxious that there will be a further lockdown after restrictions are eased again. I feel less anxious than in the first lockdown as the lockdown is different in terms of I am now able to go to work and seems a lot more relaxed. I tend to listen and read less about the current situation as it can be scare-mongering and so I tend to avoid it. Despite the fact that corona hasn’t gone away, I am feeling more hopeful for the future however as we have a vaccine and cases seem to be largely under control at the moment- in the UK at least.
