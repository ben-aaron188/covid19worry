i am happy that they have a solution and we have the vaccine and that families are able to send there children to school and that we have a guide whwn everything will be back,  but i am so sad so many people have been affected and have lost loved ones and are not able to see family and friends.  i am anxious all the time and really had trouble sleeping as i miss my family so much, even when we get back to normality all i want to do is spend time with them. i hope this ends soon and bussiness can get back to normal as so manys work lifes have also been effected and people have lost their jobs and lively hoods.
