I am concerned about how it will affect the world especially with new variants and the slow access to vaccines. My family live in different countries and I'm worried about their access to the vaccine. However, I generally feel hopeful that the situation will improve and possibly end within a year. I no longer view the virus as an immediate threat to myself. I also can see now that where my family live and for many others there are more serious issues going on now and while covid and its side effects on mental health and depression are serious, there are other ongoing crises on many countries that are infinitely worse.
