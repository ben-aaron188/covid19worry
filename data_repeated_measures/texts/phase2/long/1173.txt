In one sense I feel hopeful and although the dates may chance depending on the data, I'm looking forward to being able to start planning things again with the reopening of society mapped out. Underpinning it however is the anxiety that it won't be straightforward and the gradually unlocking will lead to a big rise in cases and ultimately, another wave and lockdown. The vaccine roll-out is really promising but as above, we're yet to see the full data as to how this is impacting cases and transmissions. I'm hopeful it's having a big impact, but anxious that it might not be as great as hoped for.
