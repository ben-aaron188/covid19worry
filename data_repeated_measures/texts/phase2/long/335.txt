I feel worried that the end of the situation is not really in sight. I fear we will go through all this again and again when new variants of the virus rear their head again and governments can't afford to offer free universal vaccines. I am anxious that the wider  affects of the Covid situation such as economic collapse will be more devastating than the virus itself. So overall I feel a certain sense of despair and hopelessness. I feel depressed at how little the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable in society have been considered when the authorities have planned their Covid situation response. This makes me also feel angry and frustrated. I feel sad when I think of people I love who I have not been able to travel to see as I know because of their ages, I must have lost my last chance to see them in person.
