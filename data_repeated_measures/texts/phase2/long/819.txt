I have had the first dose of the vaccine and so have members of my family so I am happy about that and also happy with the vaccine rollout in the U.K. 
I hope that we’re through the worst and I’m confident that scientists will be able to protect us from future variants through vaccines. 
I’m glad we’re through the winter. Cases and deaths are down and I’m hopeful that the worst is over. 
Hopefully once the economy is fully re-open we can enjoy life as close to fully as possible and avoid full lockdowns. I’m looking forward to finally seeing friends again.
