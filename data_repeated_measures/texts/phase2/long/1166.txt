The pandemic was quite okay for me since I'm an introvert. I enjoyed staying at home most days but I would like to travel and go to the shops like it was normal. It was mostly relaxation for me and frustrated to the government, because they decide things so soon. For me, that is why the cases kept increasing. I'm betting we're having a third lockdown soon because the schools are open again. The government should had provided vaccinations to the students and teachers. Overall, I am used to the new normal and this was just an overwhelming experience for me.
