I think frustration would be the overwhelming feeling right now; it would just be nice if it was finished with. It's a bit miserable being sat inside all the time not being able to go anywhere new or even anywhere old. My 18 month old daughter hasn't ever really experienced going out other than to nursery, she doesn't know any different so is fine but it's hard not to look at her and realise just how long this whole thing has dragged on. It would be nice to just have an actual end. I worry that in 6 months time as winter starts rolling back in we see some new 'variants' that the vaccines don't touch and we're back where we started.
