I feel like there's a light at the end of the tunnel, that the corona situation may be coming towards an end. However, I feel some grief at how much we've lost and how people have suffered. 
I had my vaccine the other day and since then I've been ill with side effects. I'm so tired. I think I'm exhausted of living with the effects of covid in society as well - the effort of homeschooling and the mundanity of everything. 
I guess, though, that there is some hope and excitement at the future now. For the first time in months I'm allowing myself to browse through theatre guides or think about going to a restaurant, and planning 40th birthday celebrations!
