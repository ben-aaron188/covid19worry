I am hopeful and can see an end in sight but I am also very anxious in case something goes wrong eg another surge or worse variant. I’m anxious for my children, I want some normality, I miss my family and friends. I have had my vaccine but my husband hasn’t and he is a teacher going back to school next week. My children have missed out on so much at such a young age, my son in particular is struggling hugely with socialising and behaviour. We don’t want to get our hopes up too much, and haven’t told the children what will happen in case it all goes wrong again.
