Things seem to be looking more promising, thanks to the vaccination programme but, with a 3rd wave feared in mainland Europe and schools having reopened here, as well as mutant variants, things could turn bad again.

There's also the fact that few people have received their second dose of the vaccine yet. Until that happens, there still have to be concerns.

Personally, I feel I can make it through this period without getting infected (assuming I've not already had the disease), provided I continue to take sensible precautions.
