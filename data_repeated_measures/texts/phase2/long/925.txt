I have been an essential worker, so have been at work all through the pandemic, i am pleased in a way as the routine of normality has helped. I am pleased we have the vaccine drive under way and am proud of the nhs and uk in general efforts on the vaccine program. I looking forward to more social aspects of post-lockdown now though as it has been tough not seeing family and friends as much as normal and I know older family have struggled too, such as missing their grandchilden during the lock down periods
