I'm disgusted at this world wide con. And somewhat concerned for humanity.  In addition I worry about the deterioration of democracy. 
The future look bleak. Despair, revulsion.

 Also  now 
about being told that to complete this section i have to write 500 characters???!!!!
This will take an age a and only engenders resentment. This feels like a con for 50 p and will take much longer than 5 minutes.!!

Really? How will I know when I haVE REACHED 500 CHARACTERS?  I'm a poor typist . THIs is outrageous behaviour on the part of a researcher and i'm tempted to return this.
