I don't have a lot of feeling anymore towards covid. Except the desire to see family members safely, especially my older family. At least 2 will be lucky to see the year out and habe not seen anyone apart from nurses since the start of lockdown in March 2020. 
It is completely unfair that they have to suffer for this situation.
I would also love my youngest daughter (September 2020) to finally meet her family. She has met no one except my mother and a select few members of her fathers side of the family. 
This whole situation has took a MASSIVE knock to everyone's mental health. To the point where I habe had to seek help myself.
