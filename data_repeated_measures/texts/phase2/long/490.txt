I feel quite anxious when I have to go food shopping as many people are not social distancing properly.
I am also quite anxious waiting to be vaccinated as I have no idea when this will happen.
I am hopeful once the vast majority of people have been vaccinated I won't have to be worried when going out again.
I happen to be in a very vulnerable group of people as I have chronic bronchitis and I am overweight so I do worry about my life if I were to contract the virus.
I am also a little worried about my job prospects as I am unemployed at the moment and I cannot see numbers of vacancies going up any time soon,
