Today I feel hope as I am going in a couple of hours to get my first Jab!I am worried when I hear about new strains of COVID from various parts of the world which cannot be protected by the current JAB that are available in the UK.Everyone is still worried about the amount of people who still enter the country with covid who escape the tracking process.
We are also hoping that the government plans to open up the country on the 12th of April 2021 takes place as we can then go to more shops and have access to more services like hair dressers and gyms etc.
