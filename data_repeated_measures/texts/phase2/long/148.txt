I'm still very angry about the way that the UK government have dealt with the situation. They've used it as an opportunity to feather their own financial nests, as well as those of their cronies and donors. They have colossal amounts of blood on their hands - blood of those who have died and the blood of those who are suffering.

People in the UK have grown weary and so many are now rebelling against it. I'm beginning to think that I don't blame them. Had the government dealt with it in the same way as New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore etc, we would be pretty much back to normal now. 

My husband is a dual-citizen of UK and Hong Kong but he will lose his HK rights as he can't get back there due to HK government banning visitors from the UK because Covid is out of control here. I'm very very angry.
