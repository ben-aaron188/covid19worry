I feel frustrated at how it's been dealt with by the government, how the public have been irresponsible and how rude they can be. But on the other hand the situation has also shown how the public can be kind and caring. I suppose you could say it shows the true colours of people in power and the public. We can only hope that people's memory aren't too short and that lessons cab be learnt from this and hope that the same mistakes aren't repeated the next time this happens. I, like many, am very much looking forward to being able to hug my family and to see live sports, go to the cinema, go to a restaurant like before the pandemic. I feel China have a lot to answer for and why aren't the questions being asked now by other countries.
