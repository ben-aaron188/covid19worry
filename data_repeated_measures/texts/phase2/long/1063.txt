Im selfish, to say I'm a lot more relaxed since lock down. But it really has calmed me knowing I won't have to get close.. But I've also been just as anxious, even though I only leave the house 2 a month for essentials, what if I'm causing harm to my family that I don't even realise? My mums disabled, and is a more amune, for the past several days I've had a cold(I haven't gotten ill in anyway in years) so now I'm being told I have to get out the house incase, it's only now I'm being forced nad threatened I've realised how difficult it is with for people who don't more troubles I do, to have a place to sleep, I've never done anything that would give any trouble to anyone around me. The people with genuine troubles and need some were can't even get the proper help the need and have no one they can ask for help.
