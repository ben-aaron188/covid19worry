I feel a bit optimistic about coming out of lockdown and looking forward to seeing and hugging family. It's great that lots of people have had vaccines now. But I feel anxious as I don't want to get my hopes up in case the timeframes get delayed. I also feel anxious about things eventually returning to normal as it's just been such a long time now! I'm not sure I can remember how to be sociable and chat to people!
