An overall feeling of being worn down after 1 year with restrictions. 
Totally understand why it is happening but angry with myself for not making the most of a year of working from home. 
I have become unfit and put weight on where you would think the opposite would be true with more time on your hands.
Before the pandemic if someone would have said ""you have a year of no travelling to work"" I would have thought ""great - I can concentrate on fitness and health"" but the reality is the opposite.
I do like not sitting in traffic for an hour each way but I do tend to work longer now.
