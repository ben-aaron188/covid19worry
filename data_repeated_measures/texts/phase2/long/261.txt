I am relieved that at last, with the rollout of effective vaccines well on course to almost eliminate the incidence of coronavirus infections within a few months, we shall be able to return to something resembling normal life. I look forward to being able to meet family and friends, go out to the pub, have meal out, go on holiday again. I am optimistic that the vaccines can be modified if required to deal with any variants of concern. I hope that the pandemic will give more impetus to global efforts to combat climate change and improve the environment and measures of economic success.
