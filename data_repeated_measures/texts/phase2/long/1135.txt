I am pleased that the vaccine rollout is going well, this feels like some genuine hope after a long and difficult time for everyone. I have some anxieties about whether those who refuse the vaccine will put others at risk, including risking those who are medically unable to have the vaccine and those for whom the vaccine may not work as effectively as for others. I look forward to being able to see loved ones and friends in person, though I will still be taking some precautions for a while as a close member of my family is clinically extremely vulnerable.
