Still quite anxious and worried about myself and family members catching corona, some already have done so but thankfully they’ve all made a full recovery, feel bit better now iv had my first vaccine but worried for my 15 year old who’s diabetic and won’t receive the vaccine.  Still feel there not enough being done regards to loads of groups of young ones hanging around the streets, and nothing being done about it especially when other people are trying to follow the rules and staying in no matter how hard it is, we are all in the same boat afterall.
