I am feeling tired of this situation and can't wait for it to be over and general levels of anxiety caused by the new strains and the uncertainty of what the future holds for myself and all my friends and family. I feel differently as a person to how I felt one year ago and I look back to pre covid times and how easy life was without a dangerous infection around. But most importantly I feel sadness about the number of deaths and people grieving over lost loved ones. It has been a tough year for every body and the country is going to take years to rebound financially and with all the unemployment levels at a high many people are struggling in many ways.
