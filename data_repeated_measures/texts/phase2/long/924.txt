I've had my first jab. I'm relieved. I was going into the office as a key worker and now I can feel more confident that I'll be safe. I'm pleased that it means that I won't be putting my family in danger. I'm pleased that we will shortly be coming out of lockdown and that we can get back to normal. I'm pleased that businesses can open again as it made me very upset to see them closed and in danger of closing down. I think the government has done a good job of handling the pandemic and the budget has demonstrated that they know how to steer the country forwards.
