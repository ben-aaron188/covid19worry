I think the situation is improving and itseems as though the vaccination program will give us a way out. However I still feel anxious about going outside and worried that people will not respect the rules once they've been vaccinated or the government will relax the lock down too quickly. I also am unsure how much personal protection the vaccine will give and will carry on with wearing a mask and social distancing. I would like to know more about how long covid can live on surfaces as this is a concern for me.
