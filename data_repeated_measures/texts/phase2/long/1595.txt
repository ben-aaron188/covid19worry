currently i feel frustrated at the fact that i cannot see my friends and i feel like my mental health is suffering greatly because of that. the reason i need to see my friends is because i am going through a very rough patch and i need to have people to talk to semi regularly. i feel like problems with peoples mental health are going to last much longer than the pandemic situation. this is why i believe restrictions should be eased and if you really don't want to catch covid then you should stay inside. i also think its awful that students are getting a lot of blame for covid when they have just done exactly what university and the government has told them to do
