i am angry at the way the government is handling covid. they are making silly decisions left and right, they take out out of lockdown when cases are still rampant only to put us back in lockdown a month later. at this point im not surprised at anything anymore. i want the government to take a look at what they're doing to the country and what thry are doing to the young people in the uk. other countries have gotten past covid like new zealand yet we are still here suffering because of the poor mismanagement that some people still fail to realise
