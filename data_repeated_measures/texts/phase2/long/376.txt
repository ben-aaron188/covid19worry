I think we are finally seeing some sort of control over the virus to be able to get us back to some sort of normal living, shops being open again, business being able to open up again and we can finally get our haircut. Although, I'm so use to lock down, apart from going to work, it is a little anxiety provoking the thought of being around lots of people again. 
Also lets hope there has been enough research done on the jab as well so no long term issues appear further down the line and cause other problems.
