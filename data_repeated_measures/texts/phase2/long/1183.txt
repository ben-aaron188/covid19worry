I feel like this has gone on for a so long now, it's unfortunately starting to feel normal. I'm anxious about getting back to normal - it's going to feel strange not having to wear a mask in a shop or social distance, although looking forward not having to wear masks! I'm looking forward to doing more & going to more places, but hope people continue to keep their distance - having someone breathing down your neck in a queue was never nice! I think the vaccine is our route out of this pandemic, and really hope we do get out of it in June, but getting annoyed when I see people not following the rules, or pushing their anti-vax propaganda on people without doing research. I'm personally looking forward to having my vaccine, I want to get back to normal, even though it is a bit daunting!
