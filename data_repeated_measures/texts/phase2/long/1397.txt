I feel hopeful that the pandemic in this country will be coming to an end in a few months and we can get back some of our freedoms that we had before the pandemic.

I am still unsure as to when the rest of the world will be able to gain some normality and boarders will be fully open like they were pre-pandemic.

It could take over a year until the whole world is back to what it was pre-pandemic.

I think vaccines are good and the only viable way out of the current situation. I am not too worried about mutations as I trust that the vaccines can easily be tweaked to deal with this, similar to the flu vaccine each year.
