Im still have times when I feel upset because of a covid related covid death. I am unsure and anxious about the future because I don't feel the covid situation has changed a lot. The government has not dealt with the crisis and I have no confidence in them.  The whole victim scenario does not actually stop the spread of the virus and to be honest I am not sure how beneficial they are at the moment. I do not think life will ever go back to pre covid normality. Rumours covid wave three is iminant and likely to happen during July/August time . Im not sure how well I could cope with another lockdown.
