I saw my partner in early December and then for a couple of days at Christmas (under Scottish rules, as a non-cohabiting couple we could meet for more than one day. We have not met since. 3 says out of the last 81. 
Last week, we almost split up. 
It is so difficult to keep a relationship going under these circumstances. I am worried about us. He is starting to suffer from depression and I have had a resurgence of anxiety. The estimate for us being vaccinated is the end of April. 

I’m not even angry any more. I focus on one day, sometimes just in the morning or the hour ahead. I can’t plan anything. There is no point. I’m just sad about the opportunities lost, not only for myself, for us, but for everyone. 
I think I am resigned to it being months before we can meet and next year before life is tolerable. 
Normal doesn’t exist any more.
