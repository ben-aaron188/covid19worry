I feel that this third lockdown has been lifted too soon, we are nowhere near out of the woods yet despite the roll out of the vaccination. I am incredibly concerned about schools reopening next week also, I think this is a step in the wrong direction. On a positive note though, I feel that Rishi Sunak has done an outstanding job in dealing with the situation and cannot praise him enough. Yes, not everyone is happy and there will always be someone left out, but he was under a baptism of fire over the last 18 months and has been outstandingly fair.
