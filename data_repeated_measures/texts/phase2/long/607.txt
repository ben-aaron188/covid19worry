I feel optimistic that we are finally on our way out of this situation. Hopefully everyone can have their vaccinations and we can go back to a normal life. I am very much looking forward to being able to travel and see friends and family again. I just hope the majority of people accept the vaccine and not be idiots about it. Although I am optimistic about this I do feel the government have been a shambles throughout this pandemic and they need to take a long hard look at themselves after this is over.
