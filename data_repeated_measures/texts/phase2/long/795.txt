It is a major problem but the way I see it, we can't escape it and it won't go away so best to let us get on with our life's and we learn to live with it as best we can. Get people vaccinated and lift lockdown as soon as possible in my opinion. Life is boring at the minute as we cant do anything at all really, it gets me and my partner down a lot. But as a whole I'm relaxed about everything moving forwards, the plan set put by Boris seems logical so hopefully it can be kept to, I've stopped caring about covid as much now due to how it has failed to actually affect me or anyone I care about.
