I feel very fatigued by the Coronavirus situation; after almost a year or terrible management by the government with devastating consequences for so many people, emphasised by corruption and Cronyism. It has been tiring to be constantly angry, confused, anxious about the uncertainty and instability of daily life, and about the future as we attempt to recover from this under a government who refuse to offer the necessary financial support. There is some hope now that the vaccine is being delivered and the weather is heating up again, but I feel like so much avoidable damage has been done that it is difficult to feel truly relieved.
