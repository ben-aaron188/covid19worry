Anxiety of not knowing when this will be over and uncertainty of whether this will be the last lockdown, and when we be able to go back to normal life and do the things we enjoy and have freedom back again. To be able to see friends and family without worrying and taking a mask everywhere. My main feeling is anxiety of not knowing when this will be over and go to events and go out with people again, the thought that this might not be nearly over and a circle like event may occur again so we repeat this process
