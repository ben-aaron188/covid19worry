at the moment, i don't know enough about the corona virus, so i'm just worried. there is currently a vaccine, which has been administered worldwide, but the situation is still worrying and even tho there's a vaccine, i still need more information.
the pandemic has scared and confused moany people, and caused economic problems. i hope the vaccine works and things get back to normal soon.
also, there is a lot of fake news and misleading information, so i'm waiting to get the vaccine. in the mean time i'm missing my family and friends.
