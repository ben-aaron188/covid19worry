This time last year, I was a lot more concerned and fearful. I routinely checked the latest statistics and facts about coronavirus as it slowly started to spread through the country. Now, my daily routine has moulded around the lockdown measures imposed by my country and my behaviour has adapted to absorb the doom and gloom that characterises daily life under such a devastating pandemic. It feels eerily familiar to not have to interact with other human beings for days at a time, and to do so induces not nearly as much loneliness as it seemed to last year.
