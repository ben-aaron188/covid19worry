I feel hopeful now that people are getting a vaccine.  However as I am 48 yrs old I am worried that I still have to wait a long time to get mine.  I just need a holiday!!
I also lost my well paid job in August last year and so now I am working as a delivery driver for Tesco getting the minimum wage. Not a good place to be in at the moment.

I want it all to be over to be honest.  i want to have a BBQ at my house with the hot tub on with loads of family here enjoying a party. It's my partners 50th in a couple of weeks too and we wont be able to celebrate. Very depressing times
