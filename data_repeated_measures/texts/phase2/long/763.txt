disgust with government and how the whole situation has been handled. ranging from the slow to react back last feb/ march, failure to close borders, the handing of contracts to ""friends"" of torries without competition,  the waste of tax payers money on pep contract that failed to materialise and then recently say there is no money to give NHS staff a decent pay rise. the failure of private companies ie track and trace, the failure to pursue a zero covid policy last year.
But sadness for those who have unnecessarily died, those who didn't qualify for financial help
