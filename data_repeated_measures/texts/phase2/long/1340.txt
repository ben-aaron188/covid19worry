I feel like there is reason to now be optimistic. I feel like we, as a society, need to learn the valuable lessons covid has taught us such as proper hygeine and social cohesion. The vaccines have given hope to many that there is light at the end of the tunnel. However I still think we will have restrictions globally by the end of 2021. For that reason I do not want to be overly optimistic as we are not going back to normal quite yet and things could change for the worse pretty quickly e..g vaccine supply issues, new variants etc.
