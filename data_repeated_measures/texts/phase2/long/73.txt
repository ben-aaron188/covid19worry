 I am happy that we have a vaccine and are vaccinating everyone now. I am a bit worried about getting vaccinated but i think it is important that everyone gets vaccinated. 
 I am looking forward to things slowly getting back to normal and that my son can finally go back to school next week he has has had quite a hard time being isolated from all his friends and he has been missing school. 
 I am feeling very optimistic now and i can finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. I feel grateful that the Corona situation hasn't really effected my family in a really negative way.
