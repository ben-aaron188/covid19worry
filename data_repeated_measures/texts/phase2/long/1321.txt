it is very worrying at the moment and i am concerned for my family who are old and clinically extremely vulnerable. However with the vaccines coming and the rising temperature i am feeling hopeful for the summer. I am excited to get back to normal and to see friends again and go shopping and drinking and eating in restaurants and pubs and bars and even to go night clubbing when that is open again. i cannot wait to go on holiday too when we are finally allowed to travel abroad, so i can go exploring somewhere and get a nice tan.
