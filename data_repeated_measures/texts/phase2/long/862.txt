I feel okay about the corona situation personally. My life is very good at the moment, I have a job that I love and I'm able to live a good life. I'm not lonely and I am financially stable. I'm keeping away from covid patients in my work and I've received my first vaccine so I'm feeling pretty safe. I'm only really worried about when I will be able to see my friends as I do miss socialising with them. I don't have any vulnarable family members so I'm not worried about family getting covid and being very unwell. I feel sad for those who have lost family membrs and those who have been very unwell with covid
