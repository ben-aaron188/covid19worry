My main feeling is one of intense frustration, verging on anger at how the slow and inadequate response to covid from the government seems to be getting overlooked as the vaccination of the populace gathers pace.

Personally I am also sad and frustrated that  my life has been on hold and my opportunities have been brought to a shudering halt. I also have not seen some of friends for nearly a year now and my nerarest relatives have been phone or text only for nearly three months and before that for many months too.
