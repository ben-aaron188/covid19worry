I feel hopeful that there is a vaccine however dubious about side effects. Although I am still anxious and precautious, I am also tired and bored of lockdown restrictions and cannot wait for some normal life to resume. I feel sorry for my 5 year old son who joined reception this year and has been in and out of school this has hindered his social skills. My 18 month old baby has spend most of his life in lockdown and has not been able to have the same experiences of babies and toddlers born outside of the pandemic. 
I am greatful for the opportunity to work from home as it has brought bettter work like balance
