I feel anxious about getting the virus again but not thinking about it as much today. I am happy to have been out for fresh air but it the restrictions are getting to me. I miss my friends and family very much. Although I understand restrictions and I abide by them, it feels like happy moments are more fleeting than before the pandemic started.  I do not feel as angry as before but I do notice that a looming feeling of hopelessness is covering me most times. I do my tasks everyday and work etc but I increasingly feel like my soul leaves my body and I am a robot just producing, walking, talking but not there, there. I am able to feel happy at times as I do today, for example, but I find it harder and harder to take that good feeling in.
