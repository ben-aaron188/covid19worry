I feel that we are stuck in a holding pattern the end of lockdown is on the horizon but that appears to be pushed due to what is occurring across the sea on the continent in the EU. I can’t wait for normality pubs seeing friends seeing family sports events music events, they all seem so close but at the same time so far.

There is an event that is happening out of the country that I would very much like to attend but unfortunately it’s not looking possible never say never but with the moving deadlines and potential international solutions this is just another thing that is being affected by the long term COVID life.
