I am still anxious about the Corona situation even though things are looking a lot more positive. I think it would be dangerous to get too complacent especially when not all adults have been vaccinated. I have not yet been vaccinated myself but I am hopeful with the current rate of vaccinations currently ongoing that the Corona situation will continue to improve. I am still cautious though and comply with the guidelines set by the Government and still feel the need to be careful until all close family have been vaccinated as it is just not worth the risk.
