I feel that things are getting better and there is a light at the end of the tunnel but I don't trust things to go well.
I'm angry at the way the government have dealt with it, I think a lot of mistakes have been made and their handling of the pandemic has been atrocious.
I'm pleased with the fact that my parents have had the vaccine and I'm looking forward to being able to see family and friends.
I've found the whole experience quite draining but I'm feeling more relaxed now than I have for a while. I don't see everything going to plan though.
