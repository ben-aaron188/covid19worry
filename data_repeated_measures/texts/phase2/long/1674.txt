Frustrated and angry that a year on the UK has not moved forward. The Government failed to act decisively and strongly when it was needed; a pitfall of a populist Government. Countries like NZ are now benefiting and have an end in sight because they acted decisively, meanwhile the UK and  Scottish government continues to flounder, more interested in political point scoring and self gain than focusing on the failings that brought us here. My desire to leave this country and its failures has never been stronger.
