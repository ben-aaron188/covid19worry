I'm feeling bored of the corona situation, I want to go and see my friends, visit new places, and just do more things. However, I am LOVING having less time at work and being able to truly relax. I don't think I'll ever get this much time off again so I'm really enjoying it - I could never get bored of this. I don't feel as anxious as I did a year ago, I'm more hopeful now that we have a vaccine and an end in sight. My family are all very lucky to have not had Corona (or at least not had any symptoms) and I am hopeful that that continues. I'm feeling very grateful for my health at the moment. I miss my family more than anything else, I live alone so I can bubble with one household which I have been doing, but making the choice as to who to bubble with was a difficult one and left me feeling stress. The main anger and stress I get are with the government. They are doing a good job with the vaccine rollout but (IMO) terrible with everything else pandemic related.
