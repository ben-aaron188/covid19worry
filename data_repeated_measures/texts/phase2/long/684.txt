I am just over the whole thing. Everything is the same each day. It’s boring. I feel like I am just existing 

I just want to be able to go and enjoy myself. Meet my friends, and go for a drink and a meal. Go on holidays again. Experience new things. Relax on a beach. Eat good food that I didn’t have to cook. 

I want to feel active again. I feel like my health is deteriorating. I want the gyms to open up again. I want to go and do my workouts again. Set new personal bests. Have that post lifting muscle ache the day after.
