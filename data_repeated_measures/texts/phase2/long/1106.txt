The Covid situation at the moment is very worrying with schools reopening. I am fearful that the Covid situation will get worse again before it gets better. I feel sad at the amount of pain this has caused people, including the people close to me. I am angry at how much COVID is having an impact upon my education and my health, it is affecting my day to day living and I am also nervous that restrictions will be lifted in the next few months. In addition, I am incredibly angry at those who are ignoring the Covid lockdown rules.
