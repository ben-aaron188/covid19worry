I am very concerned that despite all the actions taken over the past year, mutations within the virus mean we are no better off. I worry about having to keep restrictions going indefinitely and the impact on the country economically and socially; but if we don't I worry about the effect on people's health, the NHS will be overwhelmed and a lot of people will die.
On a personal level, I miss family and friends,band I'm currently pregnant and very worried about what contracting Corona would mean for my baby.
