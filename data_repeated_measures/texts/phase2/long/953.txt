at the moment i don't feel anything i'm not particularly scared or anxious and i just can't wait to get normal life back although i would say i am one of the very few that has had better mental health since the pandemic started as i had gotten myself into a hole it helped me manage my money better and to stop gambling and get myself out of debt. This is one of the good things to come from it on a personal level although it has been mostly negative for everybody else.

I've never really cared much about the virus itself as i know i'm not at risk and nobody around me is at much risk from it. I will defintiely not be getting the vaccine though. Atleast not unless i am forced to get it.
