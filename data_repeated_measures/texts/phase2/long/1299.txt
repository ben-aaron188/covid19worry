Really feel like going somewhere leaving everything here. Nobody understands me.people around me just want to do what they like. They are just using me and I feel that when time will come they will leave me. Just want some understanding from them. I am able to little bit relax by doing some exercise or walk. I know that I am not the same person I use to be but other people in my home changed as well. They are looking for better options then me. They blame me that I am mad. I really wish the pandemic gets over soon and I go to my parents place. I were wish I would have done some Job so that I would have left him forever.
