I feel that the situation is slightly improving, with the lockdown and vaccinations. However it is annoying when out on essential purposes and seeing groups of people,  or people not wearing their masks (at all or properly) or not following the rules. I feel that the situation will get worse again when lockdown is relaxed as the numbers are still very high. I also feel some anxiety for the future as we don't know how long the vaccination immunity will last and what will happen in general.

I feel that covid will be around for a long time and it's been a year today since the first lockdown began and I still don't feel like the world is in any better of a place.
