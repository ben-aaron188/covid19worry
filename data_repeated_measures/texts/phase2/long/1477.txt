I feel it is on its way to getting better. I think the corona virus is on its way out but I don't think life will be back to normal for a while. I have accepted that life will take a while to get back to normal so I am calm with it all. I just hope people don't go silly so that it takes longer than it should for things to get better. I think the world will take longer than the UK to get back to normal and that will set people back. I do worry about places that aren't taking the right action like Brazil as it slows the progress down.
