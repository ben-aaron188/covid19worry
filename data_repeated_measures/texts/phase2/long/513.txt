In theory it should all be so straight forward. The vaccines are rolling out. We have all been isolating. (Well except for the idiots). That is at the heart of this really. I just really hope that as the restrictions are relaxed, people will not go mad in their behaviour. We still need to be careful. There is the frightening prospect of those who have not been vaccinated, or refuse to be vaccinated spreading the disease. I am 100% for vaccine enforcement, with medical reasons being the only exemptions. Why should be all be endangered because of the selfishness of a few.
