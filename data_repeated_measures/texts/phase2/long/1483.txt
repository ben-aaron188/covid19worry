Very very tired of it all, especially with months of homeschooling and each successive lockdown feeling harder to cope with - the last most of all, between the grey of winter and having no sense of any positives ahead. 

But I feel far more optimism now than even a few weeks ago, I feel I'm looking ahead, finally able to plan and looking forward to things (and can't wait for that time to arrive) rather than the hopeless endurance of the start of the year, when it seemed there was no end and nothing that I could do to improve the situation.
