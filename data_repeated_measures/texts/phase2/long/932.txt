The kids are going back to school on Monday, but numbers aren't as low as they were last September. I'm resigned to it, but I wish we could've had lower numbers first. I think numbers are going to climb - the lateral flow tests feel like making our kids do something unpleasant to themselves twice a week for not that much diagnostic help. Primary kids are unmasked and classes are packed and not particularly ventilated. At least the local university isn't going fully back before Easter, so perhaps our local numbers won't spike - but TBH I keep a close eye on daily covid data, I'm not sure if that's good or bad for my mental health, but I like to draw graphs. Our local numbers aren't falling for the last 3 weeks while we've been 'in lockdown' and we now know kids can catch and transmit covid, often symptom free themselves... so schools going in fully feels dodgy. In January - with numbers really high, and schools looking like they were going in I had resigned myself to catching it and hoping I got lucky (3 of my friends have had it badly, but nobody I'm close to has died). Now, with my age group maybe getting the vaccine before the summer it's going to annoy me if I get it now.

I'm convinced this government makes consistently bad decisions and makes things worse. The people who are being convinced that we have a clear timeline to 'back to normal' make me feel a bit sad, a bit angry at the state of the PM, all that.
