I am fortunate that Covid has not hit my family hard, but the financial knock on effects are being felt which are causing the anxiety, as we cannot progress with extension or re-mortgage due to being furloughed.  
Generally most days the household is happy as we try to keep it balanced for the kids, and it helps that spring has arrived and we can enjoy the simple things like time in the garden finally. 
Its been hard this past year not to see family, cannot wait for the restrictions to be lifted so we can finally give my parents a cuddle.
