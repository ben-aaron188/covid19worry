I feel ok, I feel positive that the vaccine appears to be working so far and we have a roadmap as to how we get back to a bit more of a normal life but fed up of not being able to do much.

I am hoping that there is a chance of a holiday is the summer but I would also rather not have a holiday and prevent any more lockdowns happening in the future 

I also can’t wait to see family members again and being aloud in someone else’s house as this is something that I have missed the most. 

I am hoping that the vaccination and road map stay on schedule and at the very least the Christmas time of the year is normal.
