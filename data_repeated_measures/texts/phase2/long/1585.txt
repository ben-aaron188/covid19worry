With the effective roll out of the vaccine and the ever falling infection rates, I feel like my tension around the virus is starting to dissipate. My at risk family members have all been vaccinated and I can finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. I would still follow a cautious reopening of restrictions but it's a positive sign to be thinking this way after the last few months.
Hopefully the pandemic will have changed some of society's failing and slowed globalisation a little, enabling smaller communities to thrive, however I don't see this being the case unfortunately.
