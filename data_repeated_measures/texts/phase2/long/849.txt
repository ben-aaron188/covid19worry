I’m annoyed that We are still in the same situation as almost a year ago but if not worse where so many jobs have been lost and the support from the government has been poor. I’m fearful of what is to come and anxious that how it will impact us personally and nationally in the long term. I’m happy that there is some end in sight and a potential road map to getting out of it just really hoping we don’t go back into another lockdown after three different instances. I’m pleased we have a good vaccination programme in place and look forward to the day the majority of the population will be covered and the day we can go abroad once more but isn’t it funny how the UK recorded so little deaths from the flu this year it doesn’t seem to be accurate representation of what we have endured and how flu is still around no matter what!
