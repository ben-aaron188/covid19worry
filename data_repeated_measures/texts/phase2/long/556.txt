I just want this to be all over and we can try to return back to normality even though I know we never will go back to normal. I mean what is normal? Are we ready to live in a world where we are not gonna have any freedom at all but are being led to believe that if we get the vaccine we are moving towards our freedom. We are moving towards the pull of the government and it is very sad to think many are completely oblivious to all that is going on. When I have children they are going to be living in a completely different world to that I grew up in and they are not gonna know any better. They will believe that a country that is in control of your freedom is completely normal. Makes me think twice about bringing children into this corrupt world.
