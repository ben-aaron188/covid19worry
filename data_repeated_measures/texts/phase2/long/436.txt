Iâ€™m feeling hopeful we will soon be at the end with vaccines happening, and life can get back to normal.      
Life has been hard and stressful but there is now light at the end of the tunnel. 
It was scary at the start and it has lasted way longer than I expected but now hope is here, hope that life will
Return to normal and we can have our lives back.     
The children can go back to school, shops will open, pubs and restaurants will open, holidays will begin again. 
The world is open for business again!
