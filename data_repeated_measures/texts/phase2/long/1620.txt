At this moment in time I feel much more calm about the coronavirus pandemic. I am definitely not as worried about it as I was a year ago from now. I still continue to take the same precautions as usual but I’m definitely less fearful of the virus. Some days are worse than others but generally I feel more positive about the whole ordeal, with recent progress in vaccinations and testing I am hopeful that things can only get better. I think life won’t be the same for a long time but I believe that the world is in a much better place in comparison to how it was roughly a year ago.
