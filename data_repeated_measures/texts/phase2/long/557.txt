I feel that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel. With the rapid progress of the vaccination programme in the UK I am hopeful that life may be able to get back to normal in the later part of this year. I feel a great deal of sadness for the huge number of lives lost, and also the time lost for visiting family.
I feel huge gratitude for our amazing health care workers and what they have done over the last year, and also anger at our self serving government who only care about themselves and what they will gain.
