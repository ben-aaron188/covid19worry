I have received my first dose of vaccine, as have my parents.  I feel more hopeful given the declining numbers of cases & the pace of the vaccination process.  I am still happy to abide by lockdown rules & work from home - I will be reluctant to return to the office environment.  I still do all my shopping online including food.  It will take me a long while to adjust back to ‘normal’ & I will need the situation to have vastly improved before then.  I hope the second doses of vaccine are rolled out in good time & that by next Autumn/Winter the situation will look very different from today.  I am optimistic about the future, but the future will definitely be a new type of ‘normal’.
