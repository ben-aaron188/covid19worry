I feel positive about the future. With the roadmap out of covid restrictions the outlook is more positive.  The summer will be here soon and we will finally be able to meet outdoors.  I have wanted to see my family so much but I am happy with my own family and that we have been kept safe in our own little bubble.  My husband has had the vaccine and so has quite a few members of my family.  I know that most people I know have followed the rules.  I try not to let the actions of others effect me.  Other people breaking the rules has nothing to do with me.
