I am stressed being in close contact with who I live with, their behaviour and attitudes are effecting my mood. The lack of distance from them is causing a strain. And that not asking me to do something when I've told them when I'm free is somehow my fault, I can't wait to be able to go back to work and regularly get out of this house. I am happy with other things in general such as work/life balance, the future prospects. I have a secure job and I haven't been directly affected by coronavirus..
