I feel very concerned for my loved ones and those who are high risk , i think things are opening up to quickly.  I think thinks shouldnt open until everyone is vacinated the risk is still there until this happens.  I think the cases are still high and putting alot of people at risk.  I feel more hopeful now that there is an injection available.  Lets hope that everythink gets better in the months to come and we can start to see some more normality.  I know a few friends and family who have had long covid and are still suffering with it which is very worrying.
