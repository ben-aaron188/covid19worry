I feel that there is light at the end of the tunnel and am counting down the days until the certain restrictions end such as when we can mix indoors and when shops/services open and 21st June. I feel happier now that most of the vulnerable have been vaccinated which hopefully should mean less hospital admissions if they did still catch it. I just really hope we don't get restrictions back or that they delay the dates they said we can do certain things, we all really need to get back to normal now. It's really important especially for family and friends to see each other, some people have been alone for far too long.
