I feel quite pessimistic in all honesty. I just feel extremely worn down. My living situation and finances have suffered a lot due to the crisis and I have become increasingly depressed and anxious over the past few months. I feel quite hopeless about the future and my prospects, despite having graduated my MA and feel that there is very little to look forward to.  Coronavirus is not my only concern, but it seems to have negatively impacted every aspect of my life. Health, finances, employment, standard of living and future outlook. To be frank, I'm more concerned about my mental health and state of mind than catching the blasted virus at this point.
