The vaccine rollout has given me more hope that life will soon be able to go back to a 'new' normal. We're in a better position that we were in last year. I now have other hobbies that don't require social contact with a large number of people, so I am not as bored as I initially was. On the other hand, COVID is still very much real and it is sad that so many lives have been lost. I do hope that this pandemic will soon end (some way, some how), so that I can walk through the streets without a mask through large crowds, without worrying that I will get COVID. I miss the carefree Pre-covid life.
