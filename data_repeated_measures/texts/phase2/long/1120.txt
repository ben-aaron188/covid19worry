I feel frustrated by the corona situation and the way that it has been handled by the government. The lockdown has been hard and I am tired of being told what to do by the government and don’t trust a lot of what they say. I feel we are being sent a lot of mixed signals and it’s confusing with little light at the end of the tunnel. I feel that the endless lockdowns are detrimental to my mental well being and I am angry by the way everything has been left too late and we are all paying the price now with longer lockdowns and a government that takes no responsibility for its mistakes.
