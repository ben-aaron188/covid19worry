I am content with the success of the vaccination roll out. Also how secure my employment has been and will continue to be as I work for the armed forces. I am fortunate in the fact that I havenâ€™t lost any family members or close friends to Corona Virus and most of the older or vulnerable people close to me have had at least Their first shot of vaccine. I believe the country will remain capable of dealing with the pandemic and the economy will be in a position to recover through the good continues work of our healthcare service.
