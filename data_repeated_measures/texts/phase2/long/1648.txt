I feel better knowing there are vaccines being rolled out and I feel a lot safer as I’ve been able to protect myself such as wearing my mask whenever I’m out or using public transport. I feel excited knowing this all will probably end by the end of the year. Obviously there’s a part of me that still fears the contracting the virus as it’s scary to think I may not survive it or end up dealing with a lot of health issues afterwards, but compared to last year my anxiety has reduced significantly about the idea of contracting the virus
