I’m worried about how my grades will be awarded as the government has not said much about universities. This will greatly affect my future so the uncertainty brings anxiety for myself and every other student. This is my main concern for the reasons previously stated. On the other hand, I am not worried about contracting the virus as my age group is not vulnerable. But I am worried about losing close family members. However, the vaccine programme in the UK is looking hopeful and I am very thankful for the NHS and all key workers. In terms of restrictions being lifted, I’m especially looking forward to going to concerts again, as well as shopping and going to parties.
