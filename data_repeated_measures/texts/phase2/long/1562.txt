I feel hopeful as the vaccine is getting rolled out in the UK quickly. It is annoying to me how much resources the UK has compared to other countries, while in the UK each person could be vaccinated many times, my family at home is going to have to wait at least one more year to even begin thinking about normality again. I miss them so much and somehow it makes me feel defeated but I try to stay hopeful that the governments will put money and politics aside and focus on the well being of the people. Not to even mention all the poorest countries that already struggle so much with other issues, and now do not have any access to the vaccine. 
Other than that, I am moving to a different city soon and I am finishing university and the current situation does not make it any less stressful. I am anxious about finding a place to live and being able to affor it with limited work opportunities during corona. I hope everything goes well and I manage to figure it out and I hope I can manage to safely visit my family in the summer despite the terrible circumstances.
