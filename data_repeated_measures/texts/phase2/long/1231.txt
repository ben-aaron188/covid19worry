I think the current restrictions are an over reaction given that the most vulnerable people are supposed to have had a vaccination and the vaccines are supposed to be very effective.
I think we as a country need to get back to normal as soon as possible.
The longer this situation goes on the worse it will be for vulnerable people and the low paid, both financially and emotionally.
I myself have managed to keep my job, but I wonder how long that will be the case as we seem to be grasping for orders from month to month.
