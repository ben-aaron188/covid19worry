I feel like the corona situation is getting better now but I don't trust our government and their rules don't make any sense. I'm worried about my family getting covid and I'd feel better once they are vaccinated.
I'm anxious about going to work in the office again as I prefer working from home. The general anxiety of the population can be felt which is difficult to navigate. My heart breaks for everybody who has a lost a loved one to covid or otherwise during a time when we can't even see our loved ones
