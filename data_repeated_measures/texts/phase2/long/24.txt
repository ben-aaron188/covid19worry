I am not worried about the corona situation at the moment, but I think this is in large part because I have made a conscious decision not to follow the news any more. I found that following the news about it everyday was making me anxious but wasn't actually helping me at all. My current working situation has improved because I have finally been given equipment that allows me to work from home so I don't have to worry about working in an unsafe work environment anymore. The most vulnerable members of my family have also received their vaccinations now so I don't feel as worried about them. In all honesty I'm enjoying being able to spend most of my time at home with my partner without all the social obligations we used to have, so I am trying to make the most of this before things open up again and we go back to the way things were.
