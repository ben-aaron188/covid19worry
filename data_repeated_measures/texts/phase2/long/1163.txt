I feel very frustrated with the situation , mainly due to financial reasons as yet again am unable to work , and government help is slow in arriving. I feel that we have turned the corner and that better times are on the way . Vaccines seem to be helping us out of the situation , and personally I feel happier and safer having the first dose of the vaccine . There are many times I still feel quite down about the situation and I am looking forward to relaxation of the rules and normality returning , with social gatherings with friends and family hopefully on the horizon .
