I feel as if it's been going on for long enough. The UK (and I use that term advisedly) has made a total mess of managing CV19 response and instead of being able to capitalise on our island status we've just drifted from one half-assed lockdown to the next. Too bad. I live in Scotland - NS could have made a much better job of this if she'd been in charge of the UK response and not just Scotland's. Also, sad for all the people who have lost loved ones unnecessarily and the people who are suffering with long covid.
