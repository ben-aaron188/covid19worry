 I am feeling frustrated as I just want to see my family and for my daughter to see her grandparents. 
I miss them and I canâ€™t wait to get back to some kind of normal.
We have completely followed the rules and now just have to wait until we can have the vaccine. 
My father is high risk so is now waiting for his second vaccine, hoping once he has had that then we can start seeing family again, when allowed.
I feel anxious as well because there are new strains of the virus appearing. 
I lost my job due to job cuts due to corona which has really knocked my confidence.
