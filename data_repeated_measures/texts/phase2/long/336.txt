I still feel anxious about coronavirus. I generally feel calm but if someone gets too close or I see them taking a risky behaviour this is when I feel anxious. I also feel angry that this has happened and that our government have been incapable of dealing with it sooner. I never thought this would last for one year and it is still continuing. Conspiracy theorists also make me angry and frustrated. I feel very proud and grateful to all NHS staff and key workers who have risked their lives to help others during this time.
