i feel anxious about my husband who is vulnerable and on immunosuppresants and for other elderly relatives. Hopeful that the vaccine will help the situation but sceptical also. i have no faith in our government anymore as they have showed themselves to be a complete bumbling shambles and have other agendas other that the peoples well being. I think its disgraceful how they actively put corona virus patients in nursing homes without testing. They should be held accountable for all of those deaths and should be taken to court. I think the virus is here to stay and worried about future mutations, feeling pretty vulnerable and looking to become more self sufficient with my food etc so that i dont have to rely on a system that has such massive flaws.
