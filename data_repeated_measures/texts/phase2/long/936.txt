People in the UK are conditioned into thinking that they deserve certain freedoms without accepting consequences of their actions. Too cavalier about rule breaking and doing nonsensical self gratifying gestures like clapping. Simply put the United Kingdom has got to over 100,000 death through nothing but incompetency and corrupt politics (Westminster) let's not do token gestures anymore and actually learn to behave like adults. Fines only discriminate against the poor unless they are proportionate (ie Rita Ora's ridiculous conduct)
