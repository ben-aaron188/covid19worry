I’m totally sick of the impact it’s having on my life. I’m sad for all the things I’m missing. I miss my family and friends And I miss going out and having fun and doing normal things.  I want us to learn how to live again. I want masks to go away. Corona virus is here to stay so let’s live our lives again. This inertia has to stop. I am worried that vaccine passports will discriminate against those not yet vaccinated due the priority order so does that mean I can’t have a holiday?? I don’t have much else to say, sorry
