I feel that we should all still be taking it very seriously and doing all we can to ensure there isn't yet another wave, stronger than the last.  We have a responsibility to ourselves, our families, our friends, and others to do everything we can to stop the spread of the virus and protect our national health service who have just been heroes throughout the past year (and longer).  I miss my family and friends and I look forward to a time when we can socialise with them again, whether that is indoors or outdoors.  I look forward to being able to visit family and friends and have dinners and most of all I look forward to being able to hug my nearest and dearest.  I am also getting married next year and so I am looking forward to being able to go dress shopping with my mum and my bridesmaids.
