I am just waiting for it to be over as it has been quite a long process. I’m over it. I can’t wait to leave this current situation as we have been in it for over a month. I am excited for June 21st or whatever, as I am excited to finally be able to leave the house without restrictions. I am especially excited for gyms to open in April or so as I have not been amble to go consistently for a long time so my progress is faltering. I am also excited to be able to go out and meet my friends in oublic and attend big events like concerts. I will be going to a concert in November if covid doesn’t continue, I’m very happy.
