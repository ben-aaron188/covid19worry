I have continued fears and anxieties for myself and my family from covid19, including the way it has affected our youngest daughter's education. She is due to sit GCSEs next year and I wonder about how much notice will be given to lost classroom time etc. by that time. I also have worries about the longer term economic damage that may have been caused to the UK, especially on the back of Brexit and the Financial Crisis. However, the current vaccine rollout gives me some hope that the worst is now over as far as the loss of life is concerned, and that this time next year we may be living in a much more normal world.
