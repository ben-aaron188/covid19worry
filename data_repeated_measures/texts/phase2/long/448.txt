I am so fed up of this whole pandemic. We are on our third lockdown and I miss my family. It's my birthday tomorrow and I'm absolutely gutted that I can't see any of my family. My anxiety is at an all time high and I am worried as people I know have got the virus. I'm also living in the town with the highest infection rate in my area. I am wanting coronavirus to go away and never come back. I want things to open up again. It's been a year now. It needs to end one day. Hopefully soon things will go back to normal. I don't like how when I go to supermarkets some people have no concept of following the rules and get in your space etc. I hate how some people refuse to wear masks for stupid reasons. I hate how some people are so selfish they are still having people round to their house and having parties even though we are in lockdown. I feel so trapped.
