I am hopeful things will get better soon, with vaccination and infections coming down. But I am also tired and bored of lockdown. The winter months have been tough. I just want to be able to do things again and see family and friends. It feels like it's taking so long to get to that point. I feel I am getting impatient for things to get more normal. Each milestone the government has set out just seems so far away. I feel so lethargic and like I can't be bothered to do anything, even though I have more time.
