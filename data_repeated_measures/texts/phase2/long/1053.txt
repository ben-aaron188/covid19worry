I feel quite relaxed about the Corona situation at the moment as numbers of positive cases in my local area are relatively low, I also feel relaxed and hopeful for the future due to the rollout of the vaccine, everyone I know in the vulnerable category has received their first dose now which makes me less worried about infecting them. Although the new variants are somewhat concerning, I believe we have experienced the peak of the virus and that things should stabilise in terms of infection rates as more people are vaccinated.
