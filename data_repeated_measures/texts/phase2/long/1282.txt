For me, I feel a great deal of sadness of everything that we've missed out on. A whole year, gone. I still worry about the threat of Corona virus and the impact it would have on my family, it is like a ticking time bomb. Hopefully when we look back, the time will seem shorter than it is. At the moment, I feel quite relaxed but the longer it goes on, the stranger it is. Eventually, I hope that life will return to normal and that I'll be able to return to my parents' house, that they'll have a relationship with my son.
