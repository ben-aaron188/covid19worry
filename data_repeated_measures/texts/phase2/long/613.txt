Mostly I feel angry at the government and the media for creating a situation where so many people have died and so many more are facing financial ruin.  I think that there have been so many opportunities over the last year to deal with the pandemic better, and we know they could have done it as they are doing a good job with the vaccine. I think that everything is a little hopeless and although there is a very good chance things will go back to normal soon, nobody will face any repercussions for the corruption and mismanagement that the pandemic exposes.
