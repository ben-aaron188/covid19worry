It feels wrong humans need socialisation 

I feel sad not seeing much of my family and having them round at my house relaxing 

I feel angry at the way the UK government has behaved and dealt with the situation. The mixed messages and delays were the worst thing. 

I feel unsure about being vaccinated and was very upset when I did get my first jab, I felt violated not relieved like others seem to be. 

I wonder what the new normal will look like and wether people will put up with that or not. I feel there may be more riots and protests 

I do think this government are using the situation to bring in legislation that reduces our freedoms and rights and also bring more privatisation to the NHS
