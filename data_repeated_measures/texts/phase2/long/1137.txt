Sad and fed up, we could've had a much shorter lockdown if we had of just respected it after seeing what happened in Europe, Italy especially, instead we had a year long lockdown and its depressing, government has failed us and now, even though I was working during it, I will have to pay more taxes and lose more money because of their furlough scheme. Just sad how rough the next year will be for everyone when everyone but us somehow didn't see it coming, closing international flights and letting people in the country took forever to stop which was a joke.
