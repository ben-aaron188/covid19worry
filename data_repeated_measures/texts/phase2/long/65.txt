I am more optimistic that things will gradually improve. I have received my first vaccination and that makes me more relaxed about the future. Rates of infection are falling as are deaths. This may be the time when we turn the corner and restrictions lift. I am more optimistic now about the rest of the year. The vaccines appear to work and there is hope for all of us. We are beginning to think we may have a holiday this year and reestablish relationships with close friends we haven't seen for some time
