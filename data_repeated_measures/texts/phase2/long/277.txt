It has been a traumatic period for the world but thanks to vaccinations we can now see some light at the end of the tunnel. The economic impact of the virus will be felt for some time and unfortunately a lot of people have lost their jobs, livelihoods and businesses. There is also a requirement to ensure that even the poorest countries get access to the vaccinations required too protect their people as ultimately that protects all of us. So all in all their is more hope this year and we may be able to return to some form of normality by the end of 2021.
