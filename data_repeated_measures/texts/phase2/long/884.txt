I feel downhearted at it taking so long to return to normal because it feels like there’s no difference in working from home days and weekends. I feel sad for all the businesses that won’t reopen and for those who lost loved ones. I feel slightly hopeful that with the vaccine life can return to normal soon. I feel more isolated now than I thought I would. I feel like the novelty of the previous lockdowns has worn off and so has the attitude of us all being in this together. I feel that the public’s patience is wearing thin and there seems to be constant scaremongering. I feel frustrated and disappointed that I can’t plan anything so have nothing to look forward to.
