I feel so very tired of it all. It seems as though it'd never going to end even though a huge number of people have been vaccinated. I worry for the economy and small businesses.
My children have had no life for a year and their social skills have suffered. They've also lost nearly a year of their education.
They are talking about a third wave coming.i really feel that if they open everything back up only to ose it again it is going to tip some people right over the edge. People have had enough!
