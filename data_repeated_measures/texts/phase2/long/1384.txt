I’m getting frustrated that this has been going on so long. We’re going to have to just learn to live with the virus and I’m sad that there has been so much distraction in the name of ‘safety’ when it hasn’t really done that much. I’ve lost my job and had to get a new less well paid one because of this. Now furlough has been extended I could possibly have kept the job but it wasn’t announced early enough. I’m frustrated that things which are definitely safe won’t be allowed for weeks yet - fingers crossed it doesn’t get pushed back again. We just need some normality back.
