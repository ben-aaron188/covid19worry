The situation is improving, but I do not have confidence that there will be good enough expertise employed to build again and prepare for the next few years. There will be a large consequence of everything that has happened and the current government have not provided enough confidence they are up to the job of making the correct decisions. 
There is no easy answers, but the general sense of seeing repeated mistakes will create further anxiety in society. 
Workwise there will be a fundamental shift from previous years and the uncertainty in this space is palpable.
