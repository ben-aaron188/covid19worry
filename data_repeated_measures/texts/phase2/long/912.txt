More hopeful than previously. Just hope I get the vaccine before I get the virus. But it’s also the least of my worries at the moment. Too many other things going on in my life.
This phase has been more real. It’s hit the north more. More people have died and more people have have the virus that I know. I’m relieved that my parents have both had the vaccine though. Hopefully I will be soon as I’m 52.
But it’s good that we are finally turning the corner. Just hope there isn’t a new variance that the virus vaccine cannot deal with.
