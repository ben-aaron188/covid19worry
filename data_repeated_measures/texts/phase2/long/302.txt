Happy that potentially the end is in sight and that life can return to as close to normal as is possible in the not too distant future. Having had jab 1 I feel somewhat more safe in life and relaxed about the future. I feel very sad about those who have list their lives and respect for those who have worked through at risk to their own lives.

I am sorry for those who have list their jobs during the year, but feel it was a necessary sacrifice for the greater good. I am confident that the economy will bounce back with reasonable speed
