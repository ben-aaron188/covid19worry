At the moment i feel relaxed and hopeful that we are coming to the end of the pandemic so that we can return to a normal way of life with no restrictions or mask wearing. I am also happy that the kids are now back at school which is the start of all this ending, i am also happy that soon i will get back to normal with seeing my parents and going out places for a day out even though i feel covid-19 will never go away i do feel happy and hopeful we can keep the virus at bay with the vaccines so that we never go back to this way again.
