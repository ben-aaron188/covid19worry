I feel restless due to the length of the pandemic and I wish to see it end. Although it has not had a huge impact on my own life (besides lockdowns) I have felt somewhat disheartened and down and have a strong desire to return back to normal. I feel sympathy to everyone who has suffered in any way throughout this pandemic. I have some worries for the state of the economy but I hope when we come out of lockdown for the last time we will be able to pick ourselves back up and fix everything as quickly as possible.
