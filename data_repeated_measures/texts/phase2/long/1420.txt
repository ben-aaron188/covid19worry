I feel better about the general situation since the rollout of the vaccination programme. My personal situation is still difficult because my family are abroad and I don't know when I will be able to see them. I am also worried that I will not be able to find a job in the current economic climate. But the vaccination makes it seem like there is a light at the end of the tunnel, as long as people take it up. I understand now that we will all have to come to accept the 'new normal', and at the moment I am more worried about the climate crisis than I am about the Covid crisis and I hope that the agenda will return to fighting the climate emergency soon.
