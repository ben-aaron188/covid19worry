It has been a long year and it feels like we are so close but still so far away from things getting back to normal. I'm happy that the vaccine roll out is going well, I am angry at the government because of the way they have handled the pandemic, and that they will claim success for the vaccine roll out, even though it is the NHS not the government that is responsible. I am sad at everything we have missed, especially for my kids. 
I know we can't rush to get everything open again, I just want to spend some time with my friends and family without being scared or without breaking the rules. I dont want to be a hypocrite, and  it makes me angry to see so many people just doing whatever they like.
