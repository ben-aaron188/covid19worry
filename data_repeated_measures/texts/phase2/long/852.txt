I’m angry at the people who are making light of the situation and putting others at risk through their selfishness. They seem to think they know better than the experts and their refusal to listen to reason is both frustrating and infuriating

The situation hasn’t affected me personally on a day to day level as I don’t socialise much anyway but I do worry that through de oak of what’s happening, people will cause the situation to last longer than it needs to 

I miss the peace and calm of the first lockdown
