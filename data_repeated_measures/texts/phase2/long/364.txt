Grateful that a vaccine is being rolled out well and that my dad has had his first dose. Concerned for the long term impact of the virus on several friends who've had it. Slightly anxious about how the world will look next year. Pleased that there is light at the end of the tunnel and looking forward to being able to walk somewhere other than the same old streets soon. Worried that people won't be sensible and relax things far too soon impacting on the good work that's been done to get us this far.
