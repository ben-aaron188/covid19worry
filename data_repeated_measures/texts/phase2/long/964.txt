I feel that the effort to vaccinate has been great but is completely undermined by poor security at airports.  The Brazil variant is in quite a few countries and not just the ones now being belatedly taken seriously.  The government has been far far too slow to get adequate testing done.  Even now they are targeting the wrong symptoms to some extent.  I know a case of sudden unexplained acute pancreatitis where the patient was not tested.  Other people misdiagnosed with tonsillitis.  Right at the start of the first lockdown a doctor in China described cold symptoms and a sore throat as the initial symptoms. The economy has taken a dreadful hit and healthcare in the UK is wrecked for the next decade at least.  The middle aged people will take the brunt of the crisis over the next few years.
