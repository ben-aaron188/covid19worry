I believe that our basic freedoms are being infringed upon by the government under the guise of ""protecting people"". Although the pandemic is obviously a threat to some people's lives, I believe the draconian measures are just another form of control. It is also not worth tanking the economy for future generations for a virus that only kills a minority of people. Unfortunately, it is easy to scaremonger or guilt-trip people into submission with the hysteria of the pandemic. I think that is very upsetting and worrisome for the future of the country.
