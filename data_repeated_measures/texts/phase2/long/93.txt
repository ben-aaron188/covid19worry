I am scared to catch the virus although I do everything I can to keep myself safe I am still aware that it could happen. 
I am desperate for the vaccine and feel positive towards what outcome it can give the world. 
I just want to be safe, the world doesnâ€™t have to instantly go back to normal but I want to feel safe doing some normal things! 
I also really miss my parents who live abroad and I want to be able to travel to them safely! 
I am a little bit worried about getting some side effects from the vaccine but so far people I know have been ok! 
I do fear getting covid and not being able to breath, suffocation is a fear of mine so this does fill me with horror! 
The whole covid situation has also hugely effected my anxiety with normal situations and will no doubt cause me bigger issues when we are allowed to travel and be more normal again!
