I feel very scared and uncertain for the future at the moment and its having an impact on my job search, i have been unemployed since graduating university and struggling to keep busy some days. Not being able to see people normally is increasing these difficulties. I feel very trapped at the moment and I can’t wait for things to return to normal. I haven’t been able to see family as often as I’m staying with my partner currently. This has caused a lot of problems between my family and I and some arguments.
