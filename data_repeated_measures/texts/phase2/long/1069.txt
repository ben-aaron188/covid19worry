I am feeling very fed up about the situation. It seems as if life has just stopped and everyone is waiting for something to happen. It seems extraordinary that everyday things are happening and people just getting on with life. I am doing exactly that as there is nothing else you can do, but I miss my family who live away and want to see them. It's a long time to be in limbo. I am worried about the mental health of my son who is supposed to be at university, there is nothing I can do to help him, he lives on his own and had just moved out of home.
