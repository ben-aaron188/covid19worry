I am feeling happy that the vaccine is available and is working. We are on the road out of lockdown which fills me with hope. I am excited that we may have some form of normality to look forward to. I am very glad the positive cases and deaths are falling quickly. It has been a long and difficult time since the Boxing Day lockdown but I do believe better times are coming but we will still need to be cautious. The weather is changing and the lighter nights are starting to lift everybody's mood and the 'we'll get through this together' spirit.
