I am no longer that worried about me or my family getting ill due to the vaccines that are becoming available. All of my vulnerable family members have had the vaccine so I believe if any of us were to contract the virus that we would be okay, I still am cautious when going out and will continue to be, as the prospect of getting the virus still is unappealing even if it is not frightening for me. The prime minister's lockdown exit plan has given me some hope of the situation going back to normal but it is still such a long time away and I am really missing my boyfriend, friends and family who I can't see due to the restrictions.
