I would very much like to be out of lockdown, however, i understand the need for it still. I am looking forward to when i will be able to socialise with friends and family again. I look forward to the future when we can travel to visit family abroad. I would like things to get back to semi-normal so that i can carry on with life and not feel like my young adult life is being wasted. I am worried that it will take longer than expected to get back to normal as i want to be able to do anything i like whenever i like.
