I am hopeful that this will be the last lockdown, however I do not fully trust the government. I have been working through this lockdown as a key worker (special needs teacher) so although my job has changed in its approach I have had routine etc. I have not struggled with this lockdown as much as others, however I do want things to ease so I can go see family without guilty (even though they are my support bubble) and have plans to look forward to. I have been following government guidance and may continue to do so even when life is 'back to normal' such as social distance from people I do not know. When out in public (such as running) I see people that are not following guidance and it makes me annoyed
