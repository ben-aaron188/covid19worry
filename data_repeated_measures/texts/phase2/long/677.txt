I am happy things may be looking more positive however I am worried to come out of ‘lockdown’. I feel that more things need to be in place. I feel that the government haven’t done enough, people are not valued enough such as the NHS. I am disgusted by how many people we have lost, it makes me so upset! I want to be able to see the people I care about however I am still worried it’s not safe, I miss socialising but I also don’t want to move too fast in going back to ‘normality’. I also feel like what we feel is normal has changed drastically since covid, who knows what’s a normal way to act anymore.
