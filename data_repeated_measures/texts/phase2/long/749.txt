I feel anxious about the situation perhaps worsening again. In the last year we have experienced what we thought was a way out of the pandemic only to face new variants of the virus and new waves of infections. I am no longer concerned about people I know becoming seriously ill as all the vulnerable relatives and friends have been vaccinated. I am however concerned about getting the virus and potentially suffering from 'long covid'. I am also feeling 'burned out' and worn down by the lack of freedom to live my normal life. I am looking forward to some restrictions being lifted so that I can see friends and family. When it comes to working from home I am happy with that on the whole and would like to return to the office ideally only once a week.
