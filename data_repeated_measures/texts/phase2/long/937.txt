I am Feeling a lot more relaxed, as there does seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel, especially with the UK exit strategy. With Vaccines for example and we appear to be better prepared.  Hopefully most people would have had the vaccine or already had the disease. Only concern would be the new strains. My elder relatives have had the 1st vaccine jab, so I feel they are safer now. One third of the population have also been vaccinated. Only time will tell, but the figures look like coming down.
