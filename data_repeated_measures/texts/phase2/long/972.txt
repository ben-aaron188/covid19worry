I am happy that the vaccine is being rolled out but sad at the lost opportunities of the past year and worried about the impact of Covid on my children and younger members of society.  I am also concerned about the economic fallout of Covid and how life will be different moving forward.  I don't think life will return to how it was pre Covid 19.  I am cautious about meeting up with friends again and doing things like going to the theatre or concerts or travelling outside of my local area.  I am hopeful that most adults will accept and have the vaccine in the next year and I feel that this will become an annual jab like the flu vaccine.
