I am glad that the number of new cases in the UK is decreasing and I am optimistic about the impact of the vaccine. I am somewhat happier that the UK government finally decided to implement lockdown this year and that it seems to be working. However, I am still worried about contracting covid-19 and having long lasting symptoms (long covid). I am also worried about the economic impact of covid as I have had difficulty finding work during the pandemic. And I am also sad because I cannot visit my family who live abroad.
