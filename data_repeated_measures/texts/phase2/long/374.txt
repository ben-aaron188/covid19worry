I think it's a situation that could have been resolved a lot better if lives were deemed more important than the finances of the country. However, I don't feel fear for the virus and have already had it. I just think more could have been done to keep us safe in public areas, e.g. sufficient cleaning of tables during the 50% off eat in to help out. or proper guidance on how to properly dispose and wear masks, the same way we get taught in clinical environments. Putting your dirty mask on a table that has not been cleaned happened far too often because people were unaware of virus transmission.
