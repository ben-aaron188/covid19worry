I feel scared that the virus is going to go on a lot longer yet possibly until at least the end of this year. I am really Worried about mine and my partners job security & if we will ever get to travel again. The new variants seem to be more of a threat at the moment especially in Europe which is very scary and concerning. It just seems like a nightmare which is never ending & that is still affecting a large part of the world. Although you hear little about some other countries in the news now which you heard a lot about at the start of the pandemic. The vaccine shortages and the arguements over the supply of the vaccine with Europe is also scary & could affect the effectiveness of the vaccine.
