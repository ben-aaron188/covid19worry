I feel that the situation is quite unstable, there are a few things that look very positive but there are still a lot of risks with the overall situation and I do not think the recovery has been as positive as I hoped. For example there was some good actions around people looking out for each other, and more flexible working, that I'm not so sure are going to continue, despite it being proven it can go well. I am hopeful around actions like the vaccine and the improved care, but also know people seem to be getting more complacent than ever. I don't want the good work so far to be undone, in particular.
