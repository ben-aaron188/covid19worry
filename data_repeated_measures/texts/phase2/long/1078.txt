I feel that the coronavirus is constantly changing and becoming more dangerous despite the reduction in cases of transmission. I work as a front line member of clinical staff and I’m constantly worried that I am going to catch it from a patient and bring it home infecting my husband who is high risk as he is diabetic. I am anxious because the disease doesn’t seem to be going away and even though I have had both doses of the vaccine I still feel there is a great risk of catching it even if I don’t become as seriously ill.
