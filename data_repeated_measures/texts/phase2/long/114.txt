Well of course I am thankful just to be alive ... but so saddened by the wasted year and the separation from those dearest to me. I detest our government for mismanaging it so grossly and directly causing tens of thousands to die needlessly by choices it was warned against. And I feel sad and anxious that activities that mean the most to me - travel especially - may not be possible for a while, or in similar ways as before.
I feel the virus has found out all the weak spots in our society and in our lives - it's prised open a gap between me and my partner because I respect the rules and she does not.
I feel it has left me like a desert island castaway, living in fairly miserable solitary conditions, but still thankful to be alive. And I do not trust the  vaccines not to be the ship that appears on the horizon and then passes by - not that the vaccines themselves are not wonderful  (they are), but I don't trust our government, or other governments, not to screw up exiting the situation, and set off a third wave of vaccine-resistant variants.
I also have to come to terms with the long-term impact on my aspirations and life choices. I have had to abandon plans to relocate to Europe before Brexit, and have to reorientate to a new situation where work from home may be much more common (the latter is no bad thing, but it's a big readjustment).
In short, I feel I am trapped on plague island, and governed by incompetent charlatans.
