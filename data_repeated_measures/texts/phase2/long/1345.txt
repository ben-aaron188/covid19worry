I feel sad that they I have not been able to see my girlfriend because of the restrictions in international travel and that I set out to go in the holiday industry and that has been decimated. However i also feel appreciative that I managed to get a job during the time and overall am a lot better off than a lot of people so always need to remember that there people worse off. As long as I remain philosophical about the situation as a whole then I believe that I will be ok, the moment I feel sorry for myself will not be a good day.
