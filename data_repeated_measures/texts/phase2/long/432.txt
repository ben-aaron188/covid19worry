I feel a little bit defeated by it.   I feel that time has been wasted.
Unsure about the way forward and not confident that we will get through this soon.  the way that the U K government is dealing with this does not inspire me with confidence and I don't like the fact that the Scottish government is unable to make ALL the decisions themself for the Scottish people. I am frustrated at the fact that people can travel into Scotland from other parts of the U K. There has been too much time wasted and I am sorry for all the people who have died. It makes me sad.
