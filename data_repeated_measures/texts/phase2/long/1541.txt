Currently feel that life is monotonous and work is relentless (work as a pharmacist in a community pharmacy). I worry about the affect of this stress on myself and my staff. On a larger scale I worry about the economy of the country as a whole, and the affect of so many businesses closing. I do not feel that this will be the end of the lockdowns. On a more positive note I am very impressed about the vaccination program - my own experience was very impressive, a slick well run operation. I feel tired and worn down.
