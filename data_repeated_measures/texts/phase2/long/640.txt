I am feeling more hopeful about the Coronavirus pandemic. My family has been vaccinated and my children are going back to school. I am worried about new variants emerging but hopeful I will be able to see my wider family and friends again soon. Even a coffee with a friend would be a bonus right now. I am hoping to continue some of habits we've formed in lockdown of taking life more slowly and appreciating the small things when we can. Right now I'm quite relaxed which is unusual for me. I have been for a run and it's a quiet Sunday with nothing much to do.
