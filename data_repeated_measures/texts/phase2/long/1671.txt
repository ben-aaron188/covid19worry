Even though everyone around the world is in lickdown of some sort, i feel that we as a race have managed to navigate through a one-in-a-lifetime experience that (hopefully) generations to come wont have to live through. Personally i'm feeling optimistic, but also understand this shift to a 'new normal' may continue for some time, plus economies may find things hard to start with until we're back to as close as pre-covid normal. I am annoyed at people who don't believe in the pandemic, and who flount the rules for selfish reasons, because in all likelihood these people would probably not be directly affected
