I feel sad for all the moments myself, my family and friends have missed this passed year and anxious about getting back into the world and living again. I'm worried this won't be the last lock down and I'm worried about new strains of the virus which may cause me or loved ones harm, mentally or physically. This past year has been awful for everyone I know, so many have struggled, I just want it over. I also feel sad and frustrated by our government, they could have done more and been more honest and realistic, Boris should resign.
