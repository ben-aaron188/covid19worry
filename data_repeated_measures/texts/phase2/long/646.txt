I was worried at first but not anymore. I am not afraid of the Covid-19 like I was when it first appeared. The government takes good measures to prevent the spread of the virus and that makes me feel much better. I think that we should go back to normal soon. I would like to be able to travel internationally freely. I have family in another country and I haven't seen them for more than a year because of the lockdown and it's really hard for me and them as well. My children are happy that they are back to school and that makes me happy as well. I really hope that this Covid-19 situation is coming to an end.
