I'm getting my vaccine on Monday so I'm feeling really excited and hopeful.  Our cases/deaths have dropped and we finally have a plan to get out of lockdown.  I'm excited overall.

I'm looking forward to moving on with my life - buying myself my first home, going out again and appreciating things I probably didn't before Covid!  Looking forward to spending time with my friends and family and trying out new things - life is too short as this pandemic has shown

I think the world is going to change a lot for most of us - I'm hoping that workplaces will be much more flexible now we have proven many of us can work from home - hopefully that will be an option going forward.
