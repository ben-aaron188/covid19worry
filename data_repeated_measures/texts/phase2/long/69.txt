At the moment there are feelings of frustration and anxiety.
Frustration because there are many things that I am unable to do, and have not been able to do for  long time. When it is possible to do these things, everyone else will be doing them as well, which will make those activities less, or even unenjoyable!
Anxiety is about people being given permission not to take precautions anymore and therefore acting dangerous and cavalier ways. 
I also worry for the young children who have been in ""lockdown"" for as long as they can remember, I am not sure what this will do to their brains.
