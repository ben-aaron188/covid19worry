I feel relieved that there is a vaccine that will help vulnerable people from not getting too bad symptoms. I feel annoyed that some contracts have been awarded unfairly to government related people. I think key workers have worked very hard and should be better rewarded. I wish we would have had a stronger lockdown earlier to avoid the long problems we have had. I feel used to restrictions now and I think we should try to return to some form of normality. I have been luckily to not be too badly affected by coronavirus
