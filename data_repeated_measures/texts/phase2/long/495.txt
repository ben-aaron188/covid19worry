I still feel anxious that I or a loved one could catch it and be seriously ill or even die. I am taking many precautions against constructing the virus but it is very difficult to be certain that we will not catch it. Iâ€™ve heard of people catching the virus (and dying) when all they have done for the last year is to leave the house once a week to go shopping for food. 
However, I am also very sad at how much our lives have changed and how much we have missed out on in the lives of others. I am worried that the virus may never go away and I am concerned we will have our liberties suppressed for a long time yet.
