Angry. Lockdown situations have cost me my brothers life who was taken by suicide. His depression took over when he wasn’t able to carry out his usual escape routes. Furious with how many people this situation is affecting without them actually contracting the virus. I get the focus is on stopping the spread but more focus needs to be made on the devastation this is causing with people’s mental health. I have no doubt in my mind that if my brother could still get out and carry out his hobbies he would still be here and as he just wanted to be out alone kayaking or walking he would still be corona free I’m sure.
