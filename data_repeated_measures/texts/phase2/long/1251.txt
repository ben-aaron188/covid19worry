Disgusted with the UK government’s performance. They have caused untold misery with their incompetence and dithering. They have lied to the public and have made so many mistakes with their response. At times they really ought to have known better. It is particularly annoying how they have wasted untold billions on a failed track and trace system. They have also given contracts to their mates for PPE and yet most of the time the companies receiving this money hard never produced PPE before. It’s a national scandal
