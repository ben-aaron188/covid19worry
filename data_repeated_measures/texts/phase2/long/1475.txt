Not feeling too stressed as I do not have too many worries currently and am in a better financial situation compared to last year. So I feel more relaxed and content and with the vaccine rolling out I have high hopes for the near future. I am feeling hopeful that by September things will have will returned somewhat to normality so that I an become employed again and have a higher income than I do currently even though I am not financially struggling. Being at home and not going out much has allowed me to focus on myself more and allowed me to relax hence why I feel that why now, also I am still able to talk to people everyday so I do not feel too disconnected from those who would normally be around me.
