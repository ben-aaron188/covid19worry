I feel things are very much improving. A couple of weeks ago, there were sixteen hundred deaths a day, this has declined to three hundred. The vaccine role out is nothing short of amazing. It's really amazing what a few weeks and a few million vaccines can do. I am hopeful for the future and meeting friends and family. I am also very hopeful for weddings, gatherings, going for meals out, going to the pub and life returning to normal very soon. In my head I have planned getting my hair done, a facial and meeting up with friends and family
