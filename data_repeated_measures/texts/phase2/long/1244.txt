I feel slightly less concerned than I did a year ago. I've managed to avoid Covid, as have my husband and two children, and now with the vaccination programme we feel slightly less anxious about contracting it.  My husband has a weakened immune system so it could have been deadly for him.  I am hopeful that things may return to normal soon. I feel sorry for my children who have had a year of on-and-off schooling and not as much fun as they normally would have had (at parks, playgrounds, attractions etc).
