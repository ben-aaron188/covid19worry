I am feeling a lot more positive about corona virus now that the vaccine has been rolled out and we are starting to look as though we are going to start coming out of lockdown in the near future.
As a new mother I am really looking forward to being able to meet family and friends and enjoy my maternity leave. To be able to enjoy dinners in restaurants and overnight stays in hotels.
I am also hoping once I return to work that I will be back in the office at least a couple days a week, as it would be nice to be around co-workers again, as it definitely makes the working day go by a lot better.
