I hope that the infection level will keep getting lower, and that society will be able to reopen. I don't like the fact that the government is forcing the vaccine on us. The climate of fear created by the media has to stop, and we need to start dealing with the virus in a more rational way. I hope the variants won't be used as an excuse to keep us in a never-ending cycle of lockdowns and reopenings, and having to take new vaccines every six months. The pharmaceutical industry must be very happy about the current situation, and should be kept in check.
