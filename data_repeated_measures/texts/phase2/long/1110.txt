I’m glad that my parents and grandparents have had vaccines, which feels hopeful for the future. But i’m sad that my child can’t have the social experiences that I think she should at this age. I’m frustrated that we are stuck at home and it’s too cold to go walking or play outside. 

The weather is compounding my mood - if it was sunny and warm I wouldn’t mind so much. But the months of freezing weather have made me so miserable.

Overall I have benefited from the virus, I got a job in an industry that’s profiting and can work from home, but recently it’s been hard to see the up side because it’s been so long. Even small things that would make me happy at the moment, like nipping to ikea for a new piece of furniture is impossible. I feel totally stuck and fed up, and overworked.
