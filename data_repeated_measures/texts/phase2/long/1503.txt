Iâ€™m feeling very positive about the situation. The vaccine rollout in the country is going extremely well - so well, in fact, that I reckon I will have had my vaccine by the time my birthday comes around on April 24th! The number of new corona cases decreases every day, the number of hospital deaths and admissions decreases every day, and things will be opening up soon I.e. restaurants, bars, pubs and shops, and by 21st June there will hopefully be no restrictions. I get tested every week at the walk-in centre, which is very efficient, and this kind of community testing us what us helping to keep the local numbers down
