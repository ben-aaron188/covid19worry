It’s exhausting in many ways after a whole year of having to socially distance from people, working at home with constant video calls. I feel hopeful that we can get back to some sort of normality again, see people etc, at some point in the future. Vaccines are very hopeful and positive. It’s frustrating to not know when that time will be but understand that for the good of everyone it is what it is.

I don’t have anything more to say but trying to make up the 500 characters and again trying to make up the 500 characters. Want to say something meaningful.
