I feel a continued sadness because I haven't been able to see my family properly for almost a year. I am still fearful and anxious about my parents being infected, although due to the vaccines available I am less worried than before. I have found the periods of isolation fairly easy to deal with and have used the time to reflect and relax, where possible. I am beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel and will be glad to see an end to this awful and strange time. However, I have been through much worse in my life so have maybe found it easier to deal with than some.
