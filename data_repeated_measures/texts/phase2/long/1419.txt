Sad it’s stopped me spending time with family, and incredible anger at how the government has handled it as there have been so many needless deaths and so many people left without help. Other countries have handled it so so much better and young people are laying the price. I’m angry that companies with links to politicians have profited. I’m sad that nurses and doctors who have worked so hard get nothing - it’s such an awful set of priorities. I’m much more confident in how to avoid getting sick than this time last year, and have been very careful - so I’m more angry and upset but the wider social impact that the virus itself.
