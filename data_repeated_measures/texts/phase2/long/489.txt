I am somewhat worried about how things will progress and whether there will be pressure to return to the workplace before I feel safe. I am worried about the behaviour of others and not being able to keep my loved ones safe.

I am sad that I haven't seen some family members who live abroad and that we had to postpone our own wedding but ultimately grateful that my loved ones have remained safe to date and financially secure. 

I am mindful that not everybody has coped as well as I have or had as many positive aspects such as increased family time in my household which I am forever grateful for.
