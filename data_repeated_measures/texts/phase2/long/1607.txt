I feel a lot less concerned and fearful for the consequences that covid-19 brings to society and the future but I am not without concern at all; Compared to the start of the pandemic. This may be due to the development and rollout of the vaccines, and that soon things may get back to normal like they were pre-covid-19. I am excited for a future where I can see socialise without fear or restrictions as I do feel that the restrictions have taken a toll on both my mental health and social skills due to isolation
