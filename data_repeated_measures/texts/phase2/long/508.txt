I feel like the situation is relentless, so much has changed and I fear that life will never quite be the same again. I used to enjoy travel, theatre, cinema, meeting up with friends and all of this has gone. It feels odd, almost like I am living in a vacuum of work and homelife, with nothing in-between. People's enthusiasm for Zoom has faded and I am scraping the barrel with what boxsets I have left to watch.  Although having said that the time to step away from the rushing around, has been positive too. I have found more time to dedicate to myself and definitely so more self-care now and check in with how I feel, take longer baths, listen to podcasts, cook more, value the time I get with people i care about and am enjoying living a more frugal and sustainable life.
