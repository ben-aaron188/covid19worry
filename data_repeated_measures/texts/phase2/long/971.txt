I feel good that the vaccine seems to be working and should all be over soon but anxious about something going wrong that sets us back to square 1, especially with there being so many new variants and also a desire to start opening things such as schools back up now as I think it is too soon. I am also anxious about catching it as I have not had vaccine yet and I think people who have had Covid and/or the vaccine will become less concerned about distancing, and some are just ignoring distancing anyway. lastly I am worried about what happens after Covid in terms of the economy and jobs/increased prices
