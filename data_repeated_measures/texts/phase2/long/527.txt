Even though the number of cases and deaths are reducing I am still very concerned, as opening the economy will lead to an increase in cases. Plus in time we will have a situation where the virus will have mutated and current vaccines will be ineffective. The politics are only bothered about the economy, and wish to open it as fast as possible without considering the impact on people's health. I think that in hindsight we should have vaccinated the workers first and told the elderly too stay at home and keep shielding. Then the economy could have been opened up, without an increase in infection rates, then the elderly should have been vaccinated.
