I am starting to feel a bit more hopeful that we may be over the worst. I had my vaccine yesterday and my mum has had hers so I’m starting to look forward to making plans to see her, as it’s looking ever closer to being possible. There is still a lot of worry and sadness but the vaccines are rolling out fast so hopefully it won’t be for much longer. For the UK atleast... there is still a lot of work to do over the rest of the world which I fear will take a long time. 
It is frustrating to see people breaking the rules. I don’t understand why everyone can’t work together to get it over with faster and get the transmission rate down.
