I am very fearful of this pandemic, I am fearful for my family. It angers me that there are many individuals who are ignoring the lockdown rules and are then moaning about how long we are locked down for. If they had the intelligence they would comply for a short time period and then we would be out again. I worry about friends who are struggling to live as they work in the tattoo business and beauty business. I can’t see us coming out of lockdown in June as I have noticed that people are back on the roads in a morning. I can’t see it being “normal” ever again. I can see face masks sticking around.
