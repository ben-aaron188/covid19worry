Anxious when I leave the house and entering shops etc. Have seen a lot of people not following rules and not sanitising etc. Makes me angry when people won’t follow the rules as the pandemic will not improve. Scared about my own families health as we are sheilding and in the high risk category so we are doing the best we can to limit ourselves from going out to shops, leaving the house. Feel like a lot of people think one day it’s all going to be gone and it will be safe to mingle and return to normal but I believe it’s going to be a very slow process to return to normal.
