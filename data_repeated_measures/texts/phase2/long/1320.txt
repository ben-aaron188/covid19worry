Anxious about what the future holds, but also rather worried about what is going to happen as schools go back next week and as lockdown is gradually eased and lifted, not sure I can take another wave and another lockdown. Slightly optimistic for the future and returning to some sort of normality, whatever that may be. I do feel masks and perhaps distancing are going to be the new normal but if I can see and hug friends and family again that is a compromise I am willing to take. Lockdown has taken a huge toll on me and I am ready for it to be over.
