I feel weary of it all. I’ve had enough of the restrictions and all the misery it’s brought. I just want to go out again. I want to get back to my normal life. I do like some aspects. For example I like working from home and want to keep doing this in future. I also like going to the pub without having loads of people crowding round. That’s all I have to say. I can’t think of anything else. There isn’t anything else I can think of about this but I think like everyone else I’m a bit over this. Maybe the prospect of the vaccine is making me lower my guard like everyone else. I’m also hoping we can go away this summer and have some day trips like we used to.
