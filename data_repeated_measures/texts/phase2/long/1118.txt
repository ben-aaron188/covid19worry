It has been a very long year and the Covid situation is taking its toll. I am fed up of being at home all the time although I think winter has also contributed to my feelings. Having the children at home has been hard as well. My son found it difficult to keep motivated with online work so our relationship has been strained due to me trying to motivate him or tell him the importance of a good education and him not wanting to listen to me. He is a teenager so negotiations are more difficult at his age.

On the positive side I am really looking forward to the Spring, I check my fruit trees daily to see how their flowers are developing and I can feel that winter is almost over. I am looking forward to the warm weather and all the wildlife that Spring brings to our garden. 

I also, in a way, feel a bit more confident this time about how the government is handling the pandemic. I saw with despair how the government opened the economy too quickly or let the children in Secondary schools be in lessons without masks. I think they are better organised this time so I am feeling more confident and safer now.
