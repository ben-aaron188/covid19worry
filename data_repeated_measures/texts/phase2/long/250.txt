At this moment I feel a lot of sadness, as it's been a year since we started lockdown, this 'anniversary ' has caused me to reflect. It will be another of my nephews birthdays we will miss been together (27th March). I'm organising a gift this morning to send to his house, as cannot visit again.
My children have been in school for this lockdown, previously weren't. All their class friends went back with them yrsterday, the excitement. I worry that by autumn they will be off again. This horrid virus has robbed us of what it means to be a human, hug, spend time with family. Feeling very sad today.
