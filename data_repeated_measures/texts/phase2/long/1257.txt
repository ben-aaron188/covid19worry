Still worried for the elderly but hopeful we can be safe when more people are vaccinated. I am looking forward to seeing family again and enjoying time with friends at a restaurant. I still feel like masks are needed and the thought of large crowds still makes me feel anxious, but I am more excited to go to the cinema and beach with my family. I miss day trips and garden parties and am excited for the summer. I do not feel like large gatherings such as clubs or festivals will be feasible any time soon.
