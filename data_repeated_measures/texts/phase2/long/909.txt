I very much feel Hopeless that things are going to ever change and get better. That anyone will be able to leave the house and live a normal-ish life. Fearful of getting sick and even worse dying which i know is a risk every time that i go out. Worried about my family getting sick and sad because it's been so long since i have seen anyone i love and i feel like life is slowing withering away. Just really sad, and anxious over all i hope things get better soon. i dont really think that there is much more to express than that.
