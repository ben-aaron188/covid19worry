I feel things are improving a little bit.  Vaccine rollout is going smoothly and soon the vunerable will have some protection against covid.  I think things will be more relaxed this summer, but in the winter months restrictions will have to apply to keep covid under control. I feel hopeful, but cautious regarding the future. As time goes by the scientists will learn a lot more about the virus and how it transmits in certain situations and we all will be able to help protect ourselves by having vaccines every year. Holidays abroad will not be the same for a very long time and it will take a long time for the holiday industry to recover from this.
