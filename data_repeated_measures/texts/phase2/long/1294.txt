I feel optimism (finally) as the end looks to be in sight.  I can now strat planning for the future.  I have never felt sad, annoyed at the Government yes, but not sad.  I am not that emotional at the best of times.  Sick of walking around my own area day after day due to the Government's inability to take the necessary steps to contain the virus. Still no idea when I will be able to visit anywhere outside the UK and this is a hinderance to my ability to travel be it business or pleasure.  Thankfully the vaccine is being rolled out (the one Governement sucess)and most people are looking to the future  I'll be able to see folk I have not seen in months.
