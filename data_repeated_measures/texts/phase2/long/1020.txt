  At this moment I have mixed feeling about the current coronavirus situation. On the one hand, I feel happy about how vaccinations are going as it's great to see the number of people being vaccinated. I feel like we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel but until I have had a vaccination I don't think I'm going to feel at ease about restrictions lifting and society returning to normal. So personally I still feel anxious and nervous about the current coronavirus situation.
