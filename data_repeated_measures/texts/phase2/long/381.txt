I'm just fed up of it, I'm sick of not being able to go anywhere or see my family and friends. I just want things to go back to normal and a clear plan for when things will go back to normal. I think the vaccine roll out has been great, now let us live our lives again. So many people have suffered in different ways from the virus from losing their jobs, not being able to see other people, I've had enough of it. Its also really hard to plan anything as before Christmas the rules changes pretty quickly and we couldn't see our family that was the last straw.
