I feel more hopeful than I’ve felt in a long time and I’m happy the vaccine roll out seems to be going so well. I am anxious about what going “back to normal” looks like as I want the freedom to make permanent changes to life like working from home. I am frustrated at the government as I feel they have not done enough and have looked after people who look like them rather than those who need it the most. I think it’s likely that fewer people will vote for them in the next election because of their coronavirus response.
