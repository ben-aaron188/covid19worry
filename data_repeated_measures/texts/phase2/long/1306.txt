Fed up of the whole situation.  Lockdown has created so many issues both health and mentally. I have struggled coping not seeing people and worried when I do leave the house. It plays on  your mind constantly.  I worry when I do meet people or even when things are delivered to the house. I'm stressed about going back to the office at some point. Angry with the lies from the government and lack of honesty with no direct confirmation of how many people have actually died of covid rather than bumping up the figures based on the deaths being 28 days after confirming being tested positive for covid. Angry that there are no figures to even show how many people have died after the covid vaccine. Sick of all of it.
