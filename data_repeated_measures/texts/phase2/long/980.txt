I'm feeling quite positive about the situation, especially in the UK. Personally, my parents and brother have had their first vaccination, which was my own main concern. The weather is getting better, which means that it is easier to get outside, and I think the messages are clearer from the government - stick to the rules but we're on the way out of lockdown. I feel encouraged. I and my partner are still being very cautious; not seeing family or friends, only bubbling together, but it is not as difficult as it was. Having said that, I think lockdown fed my inner hermit a bit anyway. I'm a reader, he's a gamer, so between us we feel it could have been a lot worse.
