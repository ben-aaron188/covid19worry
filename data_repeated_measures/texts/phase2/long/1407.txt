i feel like the situation is coming to an end in the UK with a good roll out of vaccines etc. so hopefully by the summer everything will be  back to normal and we can start seeing family and going away again. i have been working through the pandemic the and i feel like a need a break, the sooner everything retuens  to normal the quicker the country can move forward. the biggest fear now is how long it will be untill the uk economy goes down and the stock market crashes and nobady is lending money again
