I have found this lockdown much harder than 2020, even though this time I go to work during the week, not being able to do anything in the evenings and weekends has been much harder for me and makes me feel slightly anxious and sad.    I just didn’t think it would still be happening this long.  I am very much looking forward to being able to see friends again, go shopping and get my hair done and go on holiday.  Making arrangements to go out makes me excited but I do feel a little anxious that they won’t happen.
