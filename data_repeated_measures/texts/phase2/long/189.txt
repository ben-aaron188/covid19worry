Very stressed and tense, working from home I have no boundaries or switch off. I am struggling to parent, school and work effectively, I am overly offended and upset. The slightest trigger keeps me awake worrying. I don’t go out, I don’t go for walks, I have no privacy or peace. I just repeat the same day over and over until I can’t sleep at night. I am under exercises and overeating. I need a break, a change of scenery and a change of pace. My son has lost a year of developing with kids his own age and learning, he misses his friends and is stuck with adults all the time.
