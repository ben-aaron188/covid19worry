I feel bored and frustrated - I am at a time in my life where I am free to travel and this virus is making life very difficult. I realise it has had an impact on people in many different ways but I also believe that when it has been conquered everyone will soon forget it and go back to doing what they want to do in whatever way. My frustration lies with my enforced lockdown.
I have little else to say as I am a single person living alone and sticking by the recommended guidelines which require me to stay at home only leaving for exercise and essential shopping. I am very fortunate that I am able to use my computer and the internet but this is nothing like being able to do what I want with my life.
