I am pleased with how the vaccine rollout is going. The conservatives have finally done something right. However, I feel the public are becoming lazy and complacent while we are still in danger and this is very worrying and concerning. The British public canâ€™t be trusted to come together and this makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed to be British. I am also very worried about my family contracting the virus as vaccines are not 100% effective. My daughter is back at school next week and this fills me with anxiety.
