I am sad and Frustrated that a whole year has passed and we’re still very much in the grip of this pandemic. I personally know families that have lost their loved ones. I’m sad that I’ve not seen my brothers and sisters properly in all this time. My parents have stayed well and so have my family for which I am extremely grateful. I hope that slowly we can start to come out of lockdown and be able to be with our families again. People want to be able to travel a whole year of staying at home takes it toll on people’s mental well being
