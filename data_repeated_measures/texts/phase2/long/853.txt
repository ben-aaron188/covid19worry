It has gone on so much longer than I ever would have imagined. It is making me worry that we will never go back to normal, and the threat of getting the virus will always be there. I miss being able to move freely around my town, and miss being able to drive elsewhere. Although social distancing is becoming automatic, it's still a hard reality to face - if I see characters on a TV show not social distancing, it's shocking (even if that show aired years ago). I am also a researcher, and my research has been disrupted by not being able to collect data in-person.
