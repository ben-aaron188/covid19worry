There is a light a the end of the tunnel which is reassuring and I feel less concerned about contracting covid 19 as I have had my first vaccine as have many of my friends and family. I still worry about going back out into the world after working from home for nearly a year. I don't like the idea of a crowded commute and I think I am more productive working at home. I worry about the impact on my childrens lives and careers as well as their future prospects. My eldest son is buying a new house and has little job security
