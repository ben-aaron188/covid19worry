I personally feel as though it has gone on too long. If everyone actually listened to the rules we had back in March 2020 instead of ignoring them and if the government acted a bit like Australia's government with the pandemic, then we wouldn't be still in this position a year on. Yes, the vaccine roll-out is working but there's still a massive cluster of people who either can't or won't get it. 

I also think this pandemic has been hard hitting on the already hard hitting mental health situation. It has made lots of people sadder especially this Winter lockdown. In the Summer lockdown, we had the sunshine and people were gardening and we had that to keep us at home along with enjoyable walks. But now, this Winter lockdown is a complete 360 as we had dark days, rainy weather and we didn't have the sunshine until 9-10pm. In my opinion, it's brought on a lot of extra un-needed depression too.
