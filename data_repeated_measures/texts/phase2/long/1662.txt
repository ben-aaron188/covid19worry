Hopeful for the future because of the roll out of the vaccines. We need some sort of semblance of normality by Sep 21. 2020 and 2021 so far have been utterly dreadful and wasted years. Hopefully when the nice weather comes people won't be silly and ignore SD rules, fines should be far tougher with more stopping of cars and motorbikes who are quite clearly flouting the rules. Passports should also definitely be mandatory for those who choose to be vaccinated, this is a civic duty that should be mandatory for everyone.
