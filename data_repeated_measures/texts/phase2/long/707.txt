I feel like we're more than halfway through, or at least we're past the worse part so that makes me feel hopeful. I still think we're not sure how long the repercussions will go on for though so I'm quite anxious about that. I'm quite scared by how many conspiracy theories there are and how many people I know who don't want to take the vaccine (although none are in the UK). I feel numb because I've lost several family members and we weren't able to have a proper funeral so it feels like the grieving process isn't happening properly.
