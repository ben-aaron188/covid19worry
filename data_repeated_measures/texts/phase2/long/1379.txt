I am happy that the vaccination programme is progressing really well and that we are on the right road to recovery. I am still very very busy at work and it is very stressful. I am glad my children are going back to school and I hope that we can have a holiday this summer. I have had 2 Covid vaccines so I feel a lot safer. 

I wonder what the future looks like and how safe we will be going to pubs and on holiday. I think our children will remember this for the rest of their lives. 

This is history in the making. I used to feel special when I travelled to work throughout the first lockdown, it felt very different with empty trains, stations and streets. I was able to go to work much earlier because my children were at home and not at school. Now it is slightly busier but not by much really
