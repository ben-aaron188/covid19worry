Angry at government for not acting correctly during this whole situation. Many deaths avoidable due to their incompetence. Many people have died during this which is unacceptable. Also, many are now out of work. The government incompetence is going to be felt in this country for a very long time. I am also angry that many people would vote the Tories in again because ""who else could have done better?"" Shameful.

If the NHS was funded correctly they would be able to manage during times like this and 10 years of a government constantly tightening the NHS was never going to end well in a situation like this.

I think it is amazing how together some communities have came during this period and it shows that there is hope for humanity.
