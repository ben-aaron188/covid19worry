Feeling very anxious for when shops and pubs open. Worried about my financial state as I lost my job because of corona. Worried with how my online exams are going to take place and how I will afford rent. Bored with walking and online workouts and want to get back to the gym. Sad that I cant see family and friends and am wasting time at home when I could be travelling the world. Can't wait to get back to face to face teaching rather than online lectures and workshops. Still looking for jobs to help pay rent but struggling as nothing is open and so there are no jobs avaliable.
