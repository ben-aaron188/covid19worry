I am pleased to see the numbers are coming down quite significantly although the death rate is still high but am anxious as to how the changes that have been made recently re opening schools etc will impact on those numbers. Again, the impact of the vaccines have made a difference and I hope that this will continue. I do fear though that vulnerable people are being made to go back to work/normal life far too quickly. I think the economy will get worse too which makes me anxious and I think it will have an impact for years to come.
