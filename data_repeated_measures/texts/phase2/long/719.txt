I feel lost as I haven’t been able to go to work due to having to shield and I just feel a little low because it has seemed such a long time that I haven’t worked .I have shielded twice now and I worry about my job and a letdown to my staff members who are working through this And I feel I have down nothing to help support our work bubble .I feel relief that I have not caught it and feel safe at home and not worried as much but lonely as all my family work so I am at home all day on my own  .I understand that it had to be done but concerned it will come back again as I feel people don’t take it seafoods as when I go for a drive in the car the amount of people walking about in Greenwich it is worrying that so many are not taking this searioisly
