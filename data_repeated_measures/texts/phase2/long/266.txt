I feel like it’s coming to an end and we will be back to normal soon. Sometimes I feel a little anxious and sad about the situation for all those that have died, however for my individual situation I’ve found a lot more appreciation for my own life and situation and the first time in my life I’ve relaxed for such a long period of time as I’ve been on Furlough for the majority of the time. I’ve also been trying for years to have a baby and the last lockdown right at the end I found out I was pregnant. I am due to give birth this month to a little boy. So I can only be sort of thankful.
