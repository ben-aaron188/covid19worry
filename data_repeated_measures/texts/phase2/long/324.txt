I think its not a problem for younger and non vulnerable people but I am concerned for the elderly and vulnerable people. I've already had the virus and it wasn't that bad because I'm quite healthy. Although I am worried about my parents and other vulnerable people. The vaccine rollout has improved my worries and I think soon coronavirus will be a no bigger problem than the flu by this time next year. Unfortunately viruses will mutate and make it harder to guard against but hopefully the fantastic job the scientists are doing will safeguard us.
