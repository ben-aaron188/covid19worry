It feels never ending.  I am concerned about relaxing rules too early and we end back in lockdown again which would be awful. I want to be able to go out and meet friends and get food.  I want the schools back to normal and my daughters can see their friends.  It feels like we are moving at a political spped, rules are being changed because of our upcoming elections.  previously I haven't felt that, it has always felt like a clear strategy but now we are out for an election and school changes which alter depending on press reports
