I feel like i have been let down by the government, and that they have dealt with the situation badly. I feel annoyed by those who have continuously bent the rules for the own sakes, and have endangered other members of the public. I feel down because of the amount of time i have had to spend away from people, and the lack of social interaction i have had this year. I wish i had taken time to go out when i could and interact with the people that i could after the first major lockdown as i feel this would have been beneficial for me. The government has let everyone down by not taking action sooner, and by not looking at the data and realising that what they were doing wasn't working, or wasn't going to work.0
