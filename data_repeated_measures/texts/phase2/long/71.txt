I'm fearful as kids have gone back to school today so it's a bit daunting as we don't know what to expect. It does seem the virus isn't spreading as much but deaths are still being recorded which is scary. I am not optimistic that we will be back to normal life by June as the PM hopes. I guess we just need to wait and see but it leaves me feeling very anxious especially as I'm expecting a baby later on this year. That alone makes me very nervous, as well as worrying about my child who has just gone back in to school. I worry that the teachers who haven't had vaccines put our kids at risk as well as those travelling in on public transport.
