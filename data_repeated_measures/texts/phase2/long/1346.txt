I feel sad for all of the time that has been lost due to the situation, and I feel pretty anxious most of the time due to multiple close family members being high-risk. Seeing people in my life and online dismiss the severity of the virus makes me feel hopeless and angry, as it feels like no matter how careful me and others in my family are, we are still at risk due to other's behaviours. Things are looking to get better however, as some of my family members have already received the first dose of the vaccine, and are close to getting the second dose.
