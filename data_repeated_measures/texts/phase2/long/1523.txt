very bored of my current situtation and ready to resume normal life
anxious to go back to my current job, also dreading it.
angry that there are no opportunities at the moment
frustrated with myself for having wasted so much time
yearning to have a purpose and something to wake up and get dressed for.
anxious about the future and what may happen, its been so long since things have been normal. what does that even mean anymore
sad and lonely as I cannot see my friends properly 
happy that things may be getting better and retuning to normal soon
grateful that my family and friends are ok and have not really been affect
numb to all of the loss that has occurred at this point as it has not directly affect me.
