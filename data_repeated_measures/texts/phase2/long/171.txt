I don't feel to bad I feel like we are in a better place. I just hope people will stick to what we are suppost to do so we can be in a better place. All I want to do is to see my family and have a big get together and maybe a nice family holiday but only in the uk as I don't think I would risk going abroad at the moment as you just don't know what the situation is in other countries. I just feel like if we all stick to the rules and get our jabs that we will be in a much better place to relax and get back to a normal way ou life where we can go watch a music gig or go watch a game of football or enjoy a nice meal out.
