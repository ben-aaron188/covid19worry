I am hopeful that we are getting to a situation where Corona will be controlled. I donâ€™t think that we will ever be rid of it but am hoping we will be able to live with it. I will be having my first vaccination next week  which has cheered me immensely. I think that the better weather and the vaccine has improved my mental well being. I feel I have reason to be optimistic for the first time in ages. I cannot wait to see my friends and family again even if it has to be outside, I have missed social contact so much more than I thought I would. I am saddened that so many lives have been lost or changed for ever and am not happy with the way the government has handled the corona situation apart from the vaccine roll out. In summary I feel less anxious and more optimistic.
