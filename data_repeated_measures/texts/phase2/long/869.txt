I am sad about the lost year that I have experienced, the people who have lost their lives, the children who have lost a year of education, the businesses that have closed.  I feel angry that this global pandemic has robbed many of the opportunities to share time with loved ones and friends.  I feel angry that my freedom has been curtailed and like a trapped social animal caged up.  I don't see an end to this even though we have a vaccination programme.  This will not just go away and am sad that life will never get back to normal but will be a ""new"" normal.  One which I don't like.
