I feel very relaxed at this very moment and very grateful and blessed for my situation and surroundings. I do not worry about COVID, even though I believe that it is dangerous, because the present is all that matters and I choose to spend my time relaxed and focused on the present moment. Moreover, the present moment determines the future and consequently, I do not need to worry about the future. Additionally, I am overall happy in my life and hence, I do not want to cloud my thoughts with anything else. Furthermore, it is important to note that my desire about life is also high.
