I feel okay about it personally since it isn't really affecting me. I work from home and I work in the healthcare industry, so luckily my job hasn't been at risk.

I'm looking forward to getting a vaccine but I'm young so I understand it may be a while until I get one. However, I do work in the healthcare industry and some colleagues have managed to get a vaccine because of that, so I may try doing the same thing.

I do expect long-term effects of the pandemic however which will probably cause economic problems for many years to come.
