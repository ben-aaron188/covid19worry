I was worried about the virus from the start, I always took it seriously, but after a year of being extremely
cautious I got a covid diagnosis yesterday. I see people acting in silly and irresponsible ways, people not wearing masks, gathering in crowds etc. and even though I followed the rules I still caught the virus. I’m afraid of passing it on to other household members. I’m angry I caught it despite taking preventative measures. Now I just hope I will recover well and that my mild symptoms will not worsen any time soon.
