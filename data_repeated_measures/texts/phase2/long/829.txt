Completely fed up. Angry with our corrupt, incompetent government. Appalled at how they’ve handled the contracts, made poor and late decisions. They have blood on their hands. 
Pissed off that our media has been allowed to spin so much rubbish to make the general public believe certain things. Completely confused as to why the profession I work in has been allowed to be vilified in the press despite us working throughout the pandemic with zero ppe or adequate ventilation. Also, why am I allowed to mix in a room with 30 children, where there is no social distancing, yet I’m not allowed to see my parents?
