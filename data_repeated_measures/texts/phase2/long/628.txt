I feel like time has gone past quickly and I consider myself in a luckier situation than some in that I've been able to get by okay financially (though I do not work) and I also had a lot of free time (which other people don't have) but didn't accomplish much, which makes me feel kind of guilty and disappointed in myself (though I have been unwell the whole time so that's one of the major reasons for that). Though the situation feels to have died down and people are no longer in as much panic, I still feel that things could've gone better if people took it more seriously and were more caring towards others. I feel annoyance/anger towards those that still refuse to do things like wear masks and not go to gatherings etc. as this is very selfish putting others at risk and ends up prolonging the situation. My family have been shielding for pretty much the whole time and I feel drained and low-spirited from being at home for so long and feeling like every day is the same. I worry for my vulnerable parents and my own poor health when we do have to venture out for things like doctors appointments. The fact that there are vaccines now makes me somewhat more hopeful for the future though.
