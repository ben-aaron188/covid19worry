At the moment I feel positive about the vaccination programme and feel like I can worry less about my family. I think that in the summer things may start to return to normal which makes me excited. However, I am worried about the economy coming out of lockdown as well as the long term effects on peopleâ€™s mental health. I am also concerned about jobs in the long run and pay. Overall, I feel positive about the coronavirus situation however I still have increased anxiety because of it than I would have had normally.
