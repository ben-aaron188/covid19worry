Now that the government have released a road map oout of lockdown this has made me feel slightly better about the situation as I know that hopefully things will be getting back to normal soon. I just hope it sticks to that and everything opens when it should do and there are no local lockdowns. But I understand these lockdowns are essential to keep covid down! I am excited to socialise again properly as I havent seen a group of my friends in a long time and it would be lovely to see them all again together instead of only having to meet a few at a time.
