Scared angry worried and anxious about corona virus I feel helpless and that it is out of control. Feels like there's no hope left and full of despair and anxiousness about the future and what is going to happen. Feel sorry for all lives lost and worried about more deaths. Feeling optimistic about the vaccine and that it will save many lives and hopefully bring back a bit of normality to everyday living. Feel like the government have not done enough to save lives and that there is much more that could have been done.
