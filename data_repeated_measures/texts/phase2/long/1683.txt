I had been using the gym when the first lockdown was lifted, which improved my mental health and physical health greatly. However my country has been locked down twice since I started using the gym and my mental health has suffered greatly and I have not even left the house for like 3 months. The only good thing is that I am employed, compared to when I was not during the first lockdown. I am a teacher and teaching online has been a blessing as I get to use my voice everyday, something which I was not doing during the first lockdown.
