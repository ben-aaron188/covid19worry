I have started to feel optimistic at the plans moving forwards. Frustrated of how long it’s taking but understand it’s for the right reasons. I have been working from home for 6 weeks and it has been a long 6 weeks with minimal interaction. I am however grateful I haven’t been someone at home for the last year and was lucky enough as a nurse to still go out to work. We are due to have a little baby boy at the start of April and I am hoping we will be able to meet with family and friends whilst he is still little. I don’t want to lose out on those precious memories.
