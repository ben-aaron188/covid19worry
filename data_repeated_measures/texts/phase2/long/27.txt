I feel relieved and yet disappointed that schools are going back as I shall miss my children during the day and yet I know that school classrooms are a better learning environment.  I feel pleased for the roll out of the vaccine.  I also feel hopeful that the vaccine rollout might be the beginning of the return to a more normal l life.  I am also feel a little bit of excitement for this reason is also kicking in as well. On occasions I feel some annoyance at those people who are not following rules that are set out for the general public and making the situation harder for everyone and feel that they are being quite selfish.
