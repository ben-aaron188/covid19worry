I feel a lot happier knowing my immediate family have been vaccinated and that I'll be vaccinated in the summer. Covid has made this year go by so quickly, quicker than usual I think because most days feel so monotonous. I also feel better knowing I can get tested easier now in comparison to early last year. I still worry about how the government is treating the situation though and whether they are doing the correct thing or not. Overall, I'm happier than I was this time last year and I feel that the situation is only going to improve, but only if we all do our part to stay safe.
