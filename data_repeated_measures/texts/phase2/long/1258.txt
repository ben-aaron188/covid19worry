At the moment I feel apprehensive, the government have introduced the road map out of lockdown but I don’t think it is realistic. I’m still very worried about the virus due to the new strains being found in the country. Although the r rate is below 1 I don’t think it is low enough to start easing restrictions. Not all in need groups have been vaccinated, and this could lead to some major issues. I’m still worried about the virus. However I suppose it would be nice to be able to get back some form or normality, the virus has really effected my university education
