I am really annoyed by it. I am a full time student. I lost 6 months of college and it messed up my grades. I have barely seen my friends and have had to deal with depression as well as underlying chronic fatigue syndrome which as meant that I have lost some emotions and I have changed so much with a real lack of support. I am worried about going to university in September. The government half assed whether to go into lockdown, I have had family members die to covid but we are still expected that the almighty boris will fix everything and bring us all back together.
