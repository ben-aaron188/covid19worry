Very relaxed and comfortable in the restrictions currently posed. No anger but disgust at the recent budget and pay freezing of public sector workers yet again. Also disgust that millions have been wasted during the pandemic and not a single person has been held accountable. I'm lucky that I'm not directly impacted by the virus but feel disgusted by public response. As a family who have followed guidelines and worked throughout the last 12 months very little has changed or been enforced in any way. Self protection has been key in staying healthy.
