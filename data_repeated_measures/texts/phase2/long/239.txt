I am extremely exhausted. Seeing different parts of the world open up and resume life is so upsetting. Our government has failed us big time. I just want life to return to normal. Light is ahead, but I am apprehensive but optimistic. There's slight happiness seeing a way out now, but frustration comes into play because people still aren't following the rules (like a lot of people haven't been since the beginning). It makes me extremely angry as the West is so self-absorbed and all about themselves, that we can't get out of this mess.
