I feel rather lonely, and im looking forward to when the situation calms down enough to the point where social interaction will be relatively normal. I greatly desire being able to see family and froends but i am also anxious as the situation could still worsen and therefore lead to even longer periods of lonelyness and lack of physical interaction with people. It is still very hard to cope with the situation as a whole and its getting more and more lonely as time goes on. I am slowly becoming less and less motivated to comlete work or even to get up early in the morning.
