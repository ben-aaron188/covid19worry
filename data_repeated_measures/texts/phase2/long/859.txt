I feel fed up of corona as I haven't been able to do anything I would like to and I am feeling restless and sick of being inside. I have not keep up with the corona news recently so I do not know how bad it is/isn't therefore I don't feel that worried. I have made new friends during lockdown which I feel thankful for however I just want things to go back to normal so I can go to new places and see my friends and experience my youth. I feel as if I am wasting my best years stuck inside and have lost significant relationships due to this
