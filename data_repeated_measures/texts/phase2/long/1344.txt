Bored, if this had been an option I’d have picked bored! I am angry and disgusted at how the U.K. government handled it ands to handle it. I desperately desire the vaccine 
I am not dearly if covid as much right now but I am quite scared of the wider implications, for example Non emergency medical care that was pushed back, the effect on children being out of school. Whilst I desire greatly to be able to go out eat/drink/hang out with my specific friends, I feel really anxious socially, i don’t think I will enjoy big crowds and people I don’t know
