I am fed up being in lockdown. I want to go on holiday this year abroad. I know that we have to be in lockdown to keep infection levels low and stop people dying and wait for vaccine to be rolled out. I’ve had covid 19 last year and I have had first vaccine. My daughter who I was worried about didn’t get covid and has now had her vaccine. At same time I’m used to working from home and the simple life and not sure how much I will get back to rushing around everywhere. Hopefully all will progress although I guess there is the unknown of new strains so that will probably disrupt things. I live in Scotland so on the one hand it has been handled much better and on the other we live with a stricter regime and it makes me frustrated and angry at times.
