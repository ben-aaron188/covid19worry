I feel very positive about the corona situation seeing as how 2 in 5 adults have had their vaccine already and soon we should be able to go out again. I feel like the worst is definately over.  Hopefully the new variants will stay isolated and soon with the population vaccinated life will be able to go back to normal. I do think things like people working from home will continue though as it is probably saving companies money having no office space to maintain. 
Thanks
