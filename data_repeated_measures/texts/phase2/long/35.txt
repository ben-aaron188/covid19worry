It is dragging on for ages. I want things to be back to normal again. I can’t believe it has been a year since this all started. It has been too long since I’ve seen my family. I want to go out for a meal. I want to go out without having to wear a mask. I want to meet with people I’ve not seen all year without worrying about germs. I want my children to be able to play out in parks without being scared of catching the virus they keep hearing all about. I want to go on an airplane on a holiday and chill on a beach somewhere sunny again. I’m sick of going for walks for fun, that is all we ever seem to do at the moment. Home schooling is a nightmare. Thank goodness schools are opening again next week. Pass the gin.
