Until I am vaccinated, I will still feel very worried about the current situation. I have a constant fear of catching the virus, especially now that schools are back open and we have no control over the fact that our children might bring the virus home from school, We do everything we can to protect ourselves, but I still feel helpless in this situation. I know that even if we catch the virus, our chances are good of not becoming too ill with it, but if we can avoid getting it, than this is what we will most certainly do.
