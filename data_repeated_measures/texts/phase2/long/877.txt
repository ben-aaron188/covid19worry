I am in a lot better place mentally than I was a year ago and look forward to the end of restrictions. These draconian lockdowns should not have been put in place in the first place as they have only marginalised the country through the Government's intended plan to make everyone compliant and scared. This has destroyed the country. I am disgusted and worried that the Government is lying about everything they plan to do and intend to force through vaccine passports which would be a breach of our human rights and ethically and morally is inhumane. This would discriminate and force vaccination on those who can't or choose not to, removing their freedoms which this country so proudly stands for. The anger is real, but I am trying to stay level headed.
