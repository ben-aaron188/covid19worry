Whilst it is a point of concern, I'm tired. I have experienced lockdown for pretty much over a year, I have not seen my siblings as they live in a different county to me, I have seen my friends once, and the only time I leave the house is for shopping, a walk, or to go to work if an urgent face to face meeting is needed. I'm tired of the situation and I want it to be over. But not just lockdown over, I want the COVID gone so we can all live without this fear, I'd rather keep wearing the masks though as people are awful with their hygiene most of the time anyway. Tired is the best way to describe how I feel.
