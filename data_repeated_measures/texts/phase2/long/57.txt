Very anxious about having to send my children back to schools where barely any safety measures have been put into place and no measures in primary schools so the transmission rates will increase and chance are lots more people will get seriously ill and/or die, and what makes me most mad is that the government are wilfully allowing this to happen.  Not willing to spend any money on air filters for classrooms, saying secondaries are to use lateral flow tests which are only about 50% accurate if done properly to try and make parents feel schools are safe.  There are no extra measures put in place in primaries and I am just supposed to send my kids into these unsafe schools.
