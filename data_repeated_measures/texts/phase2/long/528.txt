When taking part in this survey last year I did not think that almost a year on we will still be in same position, lockdown, working from home not being able to freely see family and friends. Even though everything is still up in the air at the moment hopefully the next few months will be better and we will all be bale to get back to normal whatever that is. Hoping that the vaccine proves effective especially when lockdown is eased but with the new variants coming up on a daily basis who really knows what is happening and what might happen in the next few months
