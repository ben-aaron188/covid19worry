Initially, there was a real show of unity in the community to get through the pandemic, but I feel that has been waning recently. The winter months and the new variants have caused a sudden spike in hospitalities and deaths, which is disheartening and sad for those affected. Couple that with the shorter days, where I have essentially been stuck inside at work getting no daylight, I believe it has not been very helpful for my mental health. I personally lost two close relatives in the last few months so it has been difficult to be away from my family too, so I have a strong urge to try and get through this situation as quickly as possible.
