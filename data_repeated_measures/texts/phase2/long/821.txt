I feel like we’re going to have to learn to live with this virus and things are never going to be the same again. I’m actually nervous about coming out of lockdown and scared that if life went back to “normal” tomorrow, I’d find it incredibly overwhelming. I don’t like that I can’t socialise or go anywhere but at the same time, I feel like I’m never going to feel safe enough to do the things I did before. My anxiety is constant at the moment and I’m not sure what the future holds for any of us. The vaccine is a positive but the new strains may make it redundant so even that doesn’t feel so positive right now.
