I am anxious that when things start lifting that  cases will go up again,  already people are breaking the lockdown rules which annoys me.  I and my family have obayed the lockdown rules and I have not left my home since christmas apart from getting vaccinated.  I am lucky living in the countryside we have walks around us so easy to stay local for exercise. I don't want to go shopping so have everything delivered at the moment including groceries.  I am proud to be able to say we have stayed safe.
