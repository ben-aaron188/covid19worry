I feel a bit worried as my best friend just died on ITU from this virus. I feel I have not done enough and cannot believe this is still going on. Sorry about that. That is why I am a bit anxious despite being relatively young. In normal situation I would not feel like this. I never really feel anxious and never knew the feeling till now. But I am hoping this virus will stop and we will be able to live our normal lives soon. I hope this is only temporary and now with the vaccine hopefully things will improve and life will go back to normal.
