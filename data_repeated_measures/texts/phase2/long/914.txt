In the past year I got used to the situation. I don't have any strong feelings about it anymore. Given that we have a number of vaccinations available makes me optimistic that this will soon be over. I'm looking forward to pick up my jab as well. My work situation is still the same, I work from home most days, but I spend time at my workplace as well, where I can interact with people in person. Am also a bit worried as I have family in another country where things are not going as well as here in the UK.
