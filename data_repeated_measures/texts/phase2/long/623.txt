I am very worried what my happen if I get the virus.I’m thinking about my family and if I will need hospitalisation .I hope I will be called for a vaccine soon to reduce this anxiety I’m feeling.
I’m also worried about my children if something might happen to me.I’m worried  about their emotional health because they haven’t been able to socialise with their peers.
This whole covid situation has turned my life upside town,I suffer with insomnia worrying about it
I have been working from home and I’m also worried to go back to work and expose myself to the virus
