I am still concerned at the threat of another wave but happy that my most vulnerable family members have been vaccinated. I am looking forward to the easing of restrictions over the summer - having an end in sight helps me feel less frustrated. I am angry at how the government has handled the situation and am concerned that no lessons will be learned from their failings. I am grateful that I haven't lost any loved ones but am saddened at essentially losing a year of my twenties. I have family members who have had much more negative experiences than my own and feel very sad for them.
