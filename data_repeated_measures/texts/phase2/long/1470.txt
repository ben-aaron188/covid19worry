The progress being made in the UK in terms of vaccination is very promising, with 22 million individuals having been vaccinated so far. I will be one of the last to be vaccinated, but I am looking forward to getting it. As we are getting closer to summer, I am feeling hopeful that this year will be a lot more normal than last year. Cases, hospital admissions, and deaths have fallen greatly over the last few months. I am looking forward to this lockdown ending, and being able to see and hug all of my friends and family again!
