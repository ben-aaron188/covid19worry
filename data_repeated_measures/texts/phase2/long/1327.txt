The whole situation has been very draining and traumatising for many people. thousands of lives have been lost due to the governments handling of the situation. as a student who takes fine art i have lost out a lot of my education and the money which we pay a year we are yet too see it due to lack of studio, seminars, workshops. so many issues have been brought to light from the situation and shows the horrors of what the uk govenment is, boris johnson is a pig along with his piglets that follow him, take matt hancock for instance. so many people are suffering along with the nhs, we have been going through this for a year now and still so many people are dying, they havent done enough at all.  not just the govenment to blame when half of england cant even put a mask on over there nose. the whole country is a shambles and im sick of it.
