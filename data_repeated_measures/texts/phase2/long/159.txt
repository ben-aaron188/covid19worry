My children go back to school tomorrow and my anxiety is running high because of this. I feel tired with worrying and fearful for the future if this virus does not go away. I am also looking forward to having my vaccination and will feel less anxious I feel then.  I am feeling a bit cross also that some local people, strangers and people I know are breaking the rules. I don't understand why they are doing this and don't seem to care about the seriousness of the situation. I don't like judging people but I admit that I am and have already decided to end a friendship on the basis of the person's action over this last year.
