I know someone who has had severe health problems from contracting covid and has potential brain and lung damage. I myself am frustrated with lockdown and how my life is on hold but feel guilty for thinking like this as other people have suffered much more. It makes me feel selfish but I am angry that as a healthy individual I am effectively a prisoner in my own home.
I have had my first vaccine but had bad side effects from it and was bed bound for  3 days. I am not looking forward to the second dose and have thought about taking time off work in case I'm ill again.
