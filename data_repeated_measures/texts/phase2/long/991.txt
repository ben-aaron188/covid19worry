I feel hope in terms of the corona situation. I still feel slight anxiety and slight fear but mostly sadness for the loss the situation has caused; loss of lives, memories and time - things that can never be brought back. I feel more powerful towards the situation having had the first dose of the vaccine, I feel the situation is under control (not completely but somewhat). It definitely spikes some anxiety in me in this moment but not large amounts, more sadness than anxiety and frustration. It makes me feel some fear for the future.
