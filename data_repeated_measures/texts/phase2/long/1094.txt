We are very much settled in the way things are right now, and the weekly shop is pretty much the only thing that causes some COVID-19 anxiety. It wasn't long ago that the proposed roadmap for coming out of lockdown was announced, and I think the full lifting of restrictions is too soon. The date is also right before my birthday, so I'm hoping others won't try to pressure me to do something sociable, because I'm not comfortable with going back to normal until I've had both of my vaccine doses. It's still long enough away that I'm not giving it too much thought right now though as things could easily change.
