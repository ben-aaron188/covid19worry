I feel more at ease with the covid19 situation as we are now being vaccinated which in turn should allow us to start moving forward and having as much of a normal lifestyle as we can compared to last year when we didnt know what to expect. I have had my first dose and know i still have to play my part in keeping others safe until everyone has had both doses. Hopefully come July/ Aug we will be able to live on a more normal level than we do at the moment. I am more settled now that I am able to see my parents as I am an unpaid carer, Also due to being allowed to have bubbles i can see my partner at the weekend when i am not working which gives me a purpose where as before the bubble it just felt i was getting up going to work and having nothing to look forward too
