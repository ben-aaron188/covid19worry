i feel positive about the corona situation in my country at the moment as the current infection rate as well as daily death tolls are decreasing and have been so for some time now.

As well as this there is a vaccine roll out which makes me feel even more positive about the situation as a whole.

however this could change as their are many virus variants in my country at the moment but due to the restrictions placed on everyone the daily number of infections has come down and will continue to stay down until they are removed.
