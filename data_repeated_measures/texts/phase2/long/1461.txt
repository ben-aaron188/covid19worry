I really do feel that Covid has exposed how corrupt this government is. It was only the involvement of the NHS that saved the day. 

Weâ€™ve had Billions wasted on a private sector response that failed totally, contracts awarded without merit, and yet no money for health workers.

Lives were lost needlessly. And I think very few lessons will be learned going forward. One way or another we will be paying for this for a very long time to come, not just financially but in the numbers of people who will have to live with the after effects of Covid and a complacent government too inept and unwilling to appreciate the magnitude of their failure.
