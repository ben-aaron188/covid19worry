I am willing to follow the rules and stop the spread etc but i'm tired of the whole situation. I just want it to be done with already. I am hopeful that the vaccine will help us to deliver herd immunity and that life can begin to feel normal again. Children need to be back in school not just for their education but also for the important socialisation which they are missing out on. I also feel slightly conned by this survey as 500 words is not really just a few sentences is it? I have uni assignments that are set at 500 words its more of an essay than a few sentences to be honest.
