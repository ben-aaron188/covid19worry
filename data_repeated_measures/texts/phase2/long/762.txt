Although I'm tired and a bit fed up with lockdown, I'm starting to feel hopeful as restrictions are slowly easing and a few people I know have already had one or both doses of their vaccine. I don't want to get my hopes up too much as there are still many risks and things could change. It's also worth thinking about how on a global scale many people are still suffering - so I am still anxious to some extent. 
There's also the ongoing worry that at some point I could get Covid-19 and transmit it to someone else - most people my age have not had their vaccine so I don't want to cause anyone to be unwell. I hope that overtime these worries will calm down as things (hopefully) improve.
