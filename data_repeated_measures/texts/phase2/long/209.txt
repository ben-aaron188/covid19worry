I feel a bit duped. My children have gone back to school today, and I cannot understand why life cannot resume as normal at this point. Feeling very isolated and lonely as a result of being the only person in the household who is still working from home, alone. 

I also feel confused by the figures and wonder if we've been misled by the data and the science. I completely believe in the pandemic, however do wonder if the figures have been somewhat inflated by recording deaths as covid-related when some aren't.
