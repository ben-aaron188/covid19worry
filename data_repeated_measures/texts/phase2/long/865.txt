I am feeling just fine. I am relaxed, especially because a weekend is coming. I am feeling blessed and happy with all I have. I do not worry about the virus too much. This is perhaps for a number of reasons. First, I am young so even if I catch the virus there is a great chance that it will not affect me too much. In addition, I work from home so my exposure to others is very limited. Because I can work from home, I am feeling quite safe. I have also developed my working-from-home routine which allows me to dedicated time to cooking good food and exercise. Doing those things makes me feel good about myself.
