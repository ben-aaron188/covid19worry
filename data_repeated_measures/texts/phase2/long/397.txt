    I feel like the corona situation is getting better.
    Several people I know have received the vaccine, which is a relief, and in my area we can get the 30 minute test whenever we want.                            
    Also with the road map in place it has become easier to look forward and plan ahead. I’m looking forward to socialising with family and friends that I’ve not seen over this year, as well as camping and festivals.  
    I feel like by the end of the year, things could be back to normal.
