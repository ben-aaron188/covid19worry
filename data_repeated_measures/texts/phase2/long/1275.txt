I just have no hope whatsoever anymore and its led me to not care about anything. 

Im not even looking forward to be able to go out again or see any of my friends because i'm so anxious i wont fit in any more and am no longer attractive due to every other girl spending their lockdowns doing makeup and putting up naked pictures for everyone to see. 

I have became silent and numb. I have considered self harm a lot and have a new extreme hatred for myself.

Although i go into work in Tesco every day with a happy face and everyone views me in the way i've always been viewed as this happy bubbly person, but when i come home at night i just sit there staring at the walls feeling extremely sad. I was supposed to be off this week and am now choosing to work instead because i know ill just stare at the walls and cry.
