The current  situation of coronavirus makes me feel very anxious and worried. I feel that life has stucked up and there is no social life at the moment and infact everyone is in the same situation. I feel that we need to play our part in order to make a safe environment for everyone, atleast that's what we can. I don't see life coming back to normal soon. Despite feeling isolated, everyone needs to be responsible in the current pandemic and follow the rules of social distancing and wearing face masks for the sake of safety for everyone and to come out of this situation in the near future.
