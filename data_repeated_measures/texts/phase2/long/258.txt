Having had my vaccine I am starting to feel more secure. I am high risk but the figures recently released are looking positive.  I spoke to my elderly parents face to face this week for the first time in several months. They have also had the vaccine so I was less fearful of both catching and spreading COVID to them. Depression is getting much worse and I really need to get out. I am struggling to sleep and am having nightmares. A few signs of hope are there, though it may be down to better weather.
