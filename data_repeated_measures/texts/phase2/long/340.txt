I am feeling very scared about the Corona situation.  It is making me very fearful and anxious and I am feeling very worried about it all right now.  I feel very tense and stressed about the future living with Corona.  It is hard for me to see the future because of the situation.  This in turn is making me feel very out of control about my personal circumstances and this is hard for me to cope with.  It feels like life will never go back to how we knew it and that scares me.  I also wonder if I will ever feel safe to interact with people again, or even if I will know how to after so long living like this.  I am also worried about the efficacy of the vaccines and whether they will be effective in the long term.
