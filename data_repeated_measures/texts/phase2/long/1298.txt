I feel exhausted from the whole situation. I am no longer fearful or anxious about Covid-19. I have already contracted covid and I have had the vaccine. I just want the whole situation  to be over as I feel that my youth is being wasted. Seeing how poorly the government has handled the situation compared to other countries makes me annoyed. I have achieved so many milestones and have been unable to enjoy them because of the pandemic. But I am slightly anxious about life returning to normal, I feel socially anxious. However, i would rather life returns back to normal than for this pandemic to continue.
