I still feel very anxious about the Covid situation.  I am worried for myself, my friends and family.  I am worried for the lives we had before which may never be the same again.  I am upset for our children and the experiences and life they have missed out on. I think a year on we know what happened in the past and did not have the fear of the unknown.  I am also starting to feel a bit of hope that the warmer weather may bring an end to the situation.  I have conflicted feelings and want hope to overcome the fear and anxiety.
