I'm trying to be relaxed and accept the situation were currently in. I'm fortunate that I've always worked from home, so at least my work life hasn't been disrupted. The lockdown measures appears to be working, I'm cautiously optimistic that life will gradually start to get back to normal again in the next few months, I'm looking forward to that. We do have to be aware that things can change with the virus in the future and more lockdowns may be needed, but hopefully that wont be the case, we will have to see how that plays out.
