Glad the vaccine rollout is working well. Relieved the deaths and infection rates are falling in my country. Looking forward to getting my vaccine as I hope it will allow me to go on a honeymoon later this year. Glad the economy will soon start seeing an improvement with services and businesses able to start opening up. I hope we will soon be able to get back to some sort of normality as I miss my old hobbies of socialising with friends and supporting my football team at the stadium. Hopefully I am able to keep working from home as I am enjoying not having to commute and prefer the work life balance that working from home provides
