I am beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel now and it is very reassuring to see the positive effects of the vaccine. Life is still not easy and I am missing being able to socialise with my friends and family. I am more relaxed about the virus in my workplace (primary school) as we have found ways to keep us all socially distanced, where possible and safe. Wearing masks, distancing and washing our hands excessively has become the normal! I am testing myself twice a week which reassures myself, my family and my colleagues that I am ok and not putting myself or anyone else at risk to the virus.
