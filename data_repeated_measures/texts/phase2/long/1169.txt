I still feel there is a long way to go before we can feel like it gets sort of normal.
I am glad lots have had the vaccines but I feel we still need to ease into opening everywhere at once as this can cause the number of cases to go up.
I do feel when it is the holidays and summer time then that will be the true test of how we are coping.
I do feel they need to start pushing for more vaccines and ensuring people who have had their first one have had the second booked as lots still havent even got a date for it.
