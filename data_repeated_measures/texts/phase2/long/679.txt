As a business owner, I feel tense and nervous for the economical times ahead. I feel frustrated at not being able to see my family and friends in a social environment and am starting to feel distanced from them. As an avid league netball player; I feel lost at not being able to play for such a long time and seeing my fellow team players, as well as the physical impacts of playing, is having on my health. Social isolation is starting to creep in and I just want the world to get back to a certain amount of normality.
