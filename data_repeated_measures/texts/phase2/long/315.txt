Tired of the whole situation. Wondering what will happen to the economy and peoples future. Think the economic outlook is grim and we will have to live with the effects of the virus for decades. Hoping that my workplace will change and I will be able to work from home more. Bit more hopeful that the vaccine will allow shops and pubs to open and we will get back to some sense of normality. But overall just fed up of everything and wondered what the long term impact will be on the whole country and everyoneâ€™s future
