At the moment I just feel fed up of the current conditions, I just think it has gone on for too long and things are only slightly getting better. It’s frustrating also missing out on crucial experiences in uni and also being unable to work. Life is feeling very mundane and it is hard to see anything improving in the future. It’s hard to feel positive without having anything to definitely look forward to in the near future, a feeling that has been felt for a long time by many people. It’s also a worry when the government are also so incompetent and deaths are disgusting ly high, something that could of 100% been prevented
