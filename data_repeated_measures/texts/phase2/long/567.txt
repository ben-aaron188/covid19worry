At this precise moment I do not and never have feared coronavirus. Predicted deaths were wrong. Very wrong so why the world is locked down I have no idea. People die every year except the figures are not usually plastered all over the news. I hope people wake up because businesses are failing and people are fed up in general.
There are no flu figures anymore (50,000 deaths in UK a few years ago) and we have a test that even the creator of said it should not be used for viruses. Go figure!
I was angry about this at one point but not anymore. One can t really blame the general population when media is controlled and is nothing more than propaganda.
