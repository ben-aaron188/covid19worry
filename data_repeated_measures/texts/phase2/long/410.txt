I think overall I feel sad at the actions of people. It's been a really awful time for everyone, and I think it's really shown people's true colours which makes me sad. I'm also quite fed up of the whole situation. I want to travel to see family and have a glimpse of normality back, but it feels like it's never going to happen, sometimes due to irresponsible people ruining it and not following the rules. However, I'm feeling optimistic too with the vaccine situation. Very mixed feelings overall.
