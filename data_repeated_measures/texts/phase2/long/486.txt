I feel quite anxious still, as I am pregnant and I am a teacher so I still feel quite vulnerable to the virus. I feel sad that I haven't been able to see so many friends and family for a long time. However, I am grateful for some of them starting to get their vaccines and I feel like there is some hope for the next few months. I am definitely not booking holidays or rushing to plan things, as I want to be cautious for my own safety and the safety of others, but I am hopeful to have a positive summer with minimal anxiety around the virus.
