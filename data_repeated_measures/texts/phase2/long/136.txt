I feel weary but at the same time hopeful. I am 52 so my vaccine is only weeks if not days away so I feel that once I have that I will relax a little knowing I will be less likely to be seriously ill if I catch the virus. I feel fortunate as I do not know anyone personally who has died due to the virus but I am horrified when I see the number of people who have lost their lives to it. I feel bored most days yet resigned to abiding by the rules to hopefully keep everyone safe. I feel that by this time next year we should be through the worst and life will be back to normal.
