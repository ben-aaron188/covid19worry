I feel tired of it all, although the effect on me is minimal, so many people's lives have been affected. I hate wearing a mask but I  wear it. I feel lucky that I live in Wales as the Welsh governments handling has been better than that shower in England.
I am on a vaccine trial and have now been offered the NHS vaccine so am waiting for an unblinding appointment so I am curious about that, but not anxious.
I worry about the effect it is having on my loved ones, my mother is elderly and in poor health and I have not been able to visit since the summer, my Grandsons miss their friends and the routine of school.
