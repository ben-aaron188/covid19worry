I feel very anxious about Corona. I am scared when I think about being around people. I wear a mask everywhere I go, even if I'm just walking on the road and I wash my hands constantly. My anxiety is hard to control and I feel sadness at not being able to enjoy things I used to due to being scared of corona. Thinking about doing things in the future scares me but I am trying to be less anxious. Thinking about going to a restaurant worries me as I wouldn't be in control of what was happening. My anxiety is hard to deal with but I have a great support network and talking helps me.
