I'm excited that things are slowly getting better. I'm happy that I've had the vaccine and things are looking more hopeful. I'm really excited for things to get back to normal and for life to get so much better. I'm scared that it's never going to go away and sad at how much valuable time with friends and family has been taken away from me because of the virus. Plans for the future, because of the vaccine, are starting to appear and that gives me so much motivation and positivity to keep pushing through.
