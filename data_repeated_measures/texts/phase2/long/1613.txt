I feel tired of constant restrictions and lockdowns, especially since they feel never ending as they keep being extended. It's made me feel nervous and anxious at the thought of being closer to people like in pre-pandemic times because this has gone on for so long. I am annoyed about the way the situation was dealt with and frustrated that those responsible are not being held accountable. Trying to focus on positives include perhaps more freedom in terms of working from home in the future, as it's evident a lot of office jobs can be done remotely so this allows for more flexibility in your life. However, I'm not sure how I feel about the government's roadmap to re-opening things, as I don't think it will happen, there will be a rise in cases and another lockdown if the vaccine doesn't improve things.
