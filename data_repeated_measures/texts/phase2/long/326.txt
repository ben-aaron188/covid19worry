I feel trapped with the lockdown and although I understand why it is necessary it feels very depressing and lonely as I am a single parent. I find it hard to get any enthusiasm to do anything constructive most days. As there isnâ€™t any urgency because the next day is going to be exactly the same as the one before and the one after. I miss socialising with friends and family. Or having the option to do so. I feel no reason to take particular care of my personal appearance at the moment because no one is going to see me
