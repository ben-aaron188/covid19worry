I am the most sanguine regarding the Corona virus situation that I have ever been. I welcome the success of the vaccination programme and I anticipate the proximate return of a more or less normal life. However, I remain anxious about the long-term effects on the country's health and economy .I especially fear that primary and secondary schoolchildren have been affected in ways which may even now not yet be countenanced. There also is a fear that we may fall victim to yet another pathogen or virus which might lead to another pandemic, another national health crisis, another economic lockdown, followed by yet another depression.
