I am always scared that a vulnerable family member will catch Corona Virus as I have family and friends who have had it. I feel as though I have been less cautious than I was at the beginning of this as I have struggled not being able to see family or socialise with friends and it is only until recently that it has taken a toll on my mental health. Although it is a scary situation I am thankful that I have been able to spend more time with my daughter and partner as he normally works a lot. Corona Virus has also made me look at things so much differently and fully appreciate how much my family and friends mean to me.
