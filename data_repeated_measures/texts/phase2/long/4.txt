I am quite tired of it by now, it has been over a year and still we aren't back to normal. I just want things back to how they were, with being able to go where you wanted, when you wanted and without having to wear or see masks everywhere I go. I am no longer feeling tolerant about it. I am also quite sceptical that the vaccine will enable us to get back to normal, I think the government will be too slow and I am not a fan of vaccine passports either as I think this will limit a lot of people in doing the things that they want to do, or travelling where they want.
