Its very stressful as i already had a germ phobia before covid so now i'm ten times worse with regards to catching covid so its quite a miserable life and then you see a lot of your neighbours flouting the rules it makes me very sad.tonight for instance 1 neighbour has gone out in a taxi with 2 others all dressed up like they are going to a party.my partner and i argue all the time as i nag him about germs and he has to get washed and changed as soon as he gets in from work as i feel he is contaminated
