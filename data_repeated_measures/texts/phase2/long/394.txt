I feel very frustrated with the situation surrounding coronavirus. the response of our folks in charge has been very erratic at best. As a self employed person I feel left out of the financial packages and its like the serf or a captive on a slave ship. There is no real end in sight; the frustration of impeding real life is aggravating. The lockdown provided a bit of an earthing but its prolongation is far from logical. I appreciate what has been done, compared to other countries, but these measures at best are favourable to only some special friends and segments of society whilst 5 million plus like myself self employed have been left on the cess pit pile. This is a really crude practical joke by the folks who are running the response. It is now a new shambles with vaccinations - are we going to all get a yellow book next - no book, no access to daily life ? I belived the herd immunity but where is it - what was that all about - if one is immune why the requirement for vaccine - what spectrum are the vaccines - will we need another one in september again? When can I get on with daily life and like a normal person ? The fact a vape shop is considered essential but a clothes shop is considered non-essential ; I met an old pensioner struggling for shoes in town centre - he had the money cant use the internet and needs a new pair of shoes in the winter rain. that sums it up for me - absolute chaos and illogical. I accept the science and still the explanations contradict science. I accept the coronavirus is real and its potential harm, but what i do not understand is how certain people are getting better deal from the folks in charge - feels like we are in a medieval time. feel frustrated and my patriotic side is totally embarrassed my country (uk) is now an international laughing stock now, like a Mr Bean film. its really frustrating 1 year in what was supposed to be 6 weeks maximum and gone by the summer.
