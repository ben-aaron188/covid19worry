I am incredibly frustrated at the numerous bad decisions taken by the UK government, especially in comparison to other countries like New Zealand who took more precautions and are now in a much better position than us. The government have continually prioritised themselves and their money above people's lives, and have spent an insane amount of money on bad decisions (i.e. billions to their friends for track and trace which didn't even work, not closing borders or enforcing measures, eat out to help out)
