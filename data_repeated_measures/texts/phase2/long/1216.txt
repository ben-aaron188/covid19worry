I am now back at work in a new job and it has been hard, however i am quite relaxed about it. No one in my family has had it. and one both my daughters and husband have had their first jab. I m not sure when its me but I'm not really at risk where as the others were. The vaccination program has been a success but way too many people have died. Cant wait till we get back to normal and we can see everyone again and I can hug my daughters. I'm glad that my mother and partner have now had their jabs and financially we have been ok as I was on the sick but my husband continued working from home the whole time.
