I do not feel as anxious as I did in the past but I still feel highly anxious about the current situation and whether things are going to improve. The last year has been relentless and I feel very tired and worn out by it. I do feel more optimistic than I previously did now we have the vaccines that things will improve, but it also feels one step forward two steps back with new variants so I feel very nervous about it. I feel incredibly sad at some of the losses that we have had over the last few months because of coronavirus.
