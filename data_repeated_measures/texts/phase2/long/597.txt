I feel that at the moment people are in a better situation now than we were a year ago now that a vaccine has been developed that works and that scientists and people of the medical world know more about it.  Although the long term effects of the vaccine are not 100% sure of, if it helps to get us out of this isolating period that would be a good thing.  I still think there is a lot to Learn about the virus as there appear to be so many new strains appearing that I do get anxious that any vaccine that has been developed will not help against the newer strains.
So many people have been affected in one way or another whether it be a death of a loved one or the loss of their job or business I do fear about if we will ever return to as normal as we can. I think things will change because of this and feel very apprehensive about what the future will unfold
