I'm still very worried about the situation, but also glad the so many people have had the Vaccine. My mum and dad have both had their first vaccine, this makes me so happy and I can wait to be offered mine. My grandma on the other hand is 84 and is refusing to have it. This makes me very scared. I have had very mixed emotions.  I just dont see an end to any of it. My sons has missed a whole year of his life and watching him go from an confident little boy to a very anxious little boy is heartbreaking and there is nothing I can do about it.
