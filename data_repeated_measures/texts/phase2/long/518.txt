I have no fear of the actual virus, I am now used to being in the lockdown setting and environment so don't have any feelings towards that now, I am though greatly anticipating an exciting end to the year with things to look forward to leaving me optimistic. Everyrady does feel repetitive but as its gone on for so long and being isolated my mindset has become used to it and it has begun to feel like the new normal. I don't fear the virus as the statistics tell me there is nothing to fear for people of my demographic and purpose.
