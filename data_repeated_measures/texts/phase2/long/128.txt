I don't think the Covid-19 disease is serious enough to merit the draconian measures that go against civil liberties and threaten livelihoods.  I am against compulsory vaccinations but there are those who are in favour.
This situation is or, at least, could be exploited politically and economically by the elite.
There are those who push the idea of ""The Great Reset"" and I believe the World Economic Forum has said that ""You will own nothing and be happy"".
Is the Corona-Virus situation being cynically manipulated to fulfill a dystopian agenda?
