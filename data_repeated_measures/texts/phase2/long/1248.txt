I'm honestly really rather bored of this all now. I really want to get on the back end of the whole situation and get back to normal life. I've gone through the spectrum of being sad and annoyed about it and am now at the point of looking forward for doing normal things again. 

With the rising number of people being vaccinated I'm feeling hopeful that we won't be dealing with this for too much longer. I'm far less concerned about the safety of my family now which is also a lot better for my mental health. My nan got covid around November time and the stress of it all was horrible. But now knowing she's safe and vaccinated I feel a whole lot better. My mum should be vaccinated soon too so I'm feeling really hopeful.
