I’m glad infection rates are dropping but the easing of restrictions makes me uneasy - this is probably because I lost a family member to COVID and therefore have been unable to grieve properly. I also can’t book my vaccination as there are no available appointments so I find that a bit concerning. I am looking forward to other shops opening as well as hairdressers and barbers. Also might feel a little more reassured if lateral flow tests had a better rate of an accurate result - however I have had no issue getting a rapid appointment for this type of test
