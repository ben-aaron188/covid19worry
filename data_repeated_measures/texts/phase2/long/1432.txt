Despite the lowering of cases, I am weary to become optimistic about the situation as we have been here many times before yet another peak in the cases. This optimism usually results in people ignoring the rules more facilitating the disease spread, which makes me anxious as it increases the likelihood that people I know will be affected by the disease. This time round I feel like the government have tried to ease restrictions over an appropriate length of time however there are still massive jumps between what is and what isn't allowed I am feel like the cases will not be low enough for these restrictions to be lifted - but they will be lifted anyway due to pressure from the public on government officials, which annoys me
