I am not very bothered by it currently. I don't like that others are suffering but I am dealing ok as I'm introverted.
I don't go out that much so restrictions aren't affecting me too badly.
I am still working and not much has changed in my life.
What more can I say?
I'm not entirely sure what more I can say about it to be honest.
I feel okay and my situation is ok.
My feelings are fine and not much changed.
I literally have nothing else to say I'm afraid.
