I feel it has been a very hard for those throughout this pandemic whether still working or not, I have been in retail throughout and have seen the public change, some good some really bad, I feel the long term restrictions that were put in place have done a lot of damage. I am eager to make plans for the future again. I miss social interaction and luxuries like going to the hair dresser, it has now been a year and a half since my last visit! My nephew was born at the start of the pandemic so unfortunately this lack of outside the household connection is a normality for him at the moment.
