I just feel so drained by it all, I miss my old life so much and I don't know when it's going to change. I'm asthmatic with uncontrolled asthma but not on the vulnerable list so I'm worried about catching it because I can't breathe well at the best of times. 

Everyone else is thinking of things starting to get back to normal but I can't because I'll still be vulnerable until July/August which is when they're saying everyone will have been offered the vaccine. 

I'm just so tired, lonely and depressed.
