I’m hopeful we are near the end but fearful that people will go out too much so will send us into another lockdown before it ends. I don’t think we’ll have the summer we think we’re going to have as people still don’t realise how bad a pandemic we are living in .
I’m also worried about my children’s education and how much work they have missed in the last year. The government and teachers need to work together and very hard, to help our children be where they need to be with their education. I hope that by the end of this year , life will be relatively back to as normal as we will get.
