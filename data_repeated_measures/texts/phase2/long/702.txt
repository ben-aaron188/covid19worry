I feel very sad that the Pandemic has aged my parents. They are in their 80's and have become very dependent due to health conditions compounded by CORONA. Because of the need to shield, limited physical activity and comfort eating has worsened their diabetes and they have lost their physical stamina. 
We are saddened to have all missed so much of our young grandchildren's development and worry they may have forgotten how to hug.
Working remotely finds me exhausted when I do have to leave the house for shopping etc.
Suffer a great deal from anxiety about weight gain and appearance.
Personal relationships have been troublesome at times due to lockdown. 
Fear for things returning to 'normal' - how will i cope?
