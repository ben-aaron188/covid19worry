If feel like it's been going on for far too long. I am eager to take my children to see something other that the four walls we have been confined to. I feel the need to breath fresh air. I am saddened that my family have missed out on seeing my baby grow. I am scared that I could lose those who are dear to me. I look forward to this being a part of history we look back in and learn from. I am dreading the state of the economy after its all over. I am also so very grateful for the garden we have as I know many don't have that luxury. I am grateful I have been able to have the vaccine. I am nervous for the next few months and what progress we may or may not make.
