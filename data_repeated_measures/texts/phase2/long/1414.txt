I feel very fed up with it all and demotivated and like I have wasted a year of my life. I feel i have missed out on so many travel opportunities, time with family (especially seeing my niece grow up), and making memories with friends which is sad. I am feeling hopeful though that there is a way out of it this time though with the vaccine. But I am also nervous and anxious and worried in case it all fails and we end up in a never-ending lockdown. That would be really hard to deal with so i really really hope this is the final lockdown. I am also worried and stressed as i am supposed to go to a friends wedding abroad and i dont know whether it will happen or not. the stress of not knowing is worse than just knowing it wont happen
