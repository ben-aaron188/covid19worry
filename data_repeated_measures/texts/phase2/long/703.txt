Despite the UK vaccinating over 22 million of the population, Coronavirus is still a very real thing as we're still having thousands of people infected and hundreds dying every day. I was fortunate enough to receive my first dose of the shot 2 weeks ago (I was not expecting it at all). I took the opportunity of course. That doesn't mean that I'm relaxing or being less careful. We have had a number of cases within my place of work so it's still very much present and closer than ever. I suffer from chronic asthma so have to be very attentive.
