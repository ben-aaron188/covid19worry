Iâ€™m angry a the govt in China for not doing more to stop the virus from spreading. Angry about our govt response. Anxious about how long it will take to recover from this. Sad about all the people that died and what the past year as been like. Frustrated with all the restrictions and spreading most of the past year inside my house. Really sad and missing social interaction. Feeling like life now will be defined as pre covid and post Covid and not back to normal life. I have been in lockdown for 3.5 months so far except for a two week gap when we were free.
