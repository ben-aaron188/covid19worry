I want it to be over so I can go back to work, kids can go back to school and just want to go back to something that feels normal. I'm very happy about the vaccine rollout and hope it is the way out of the pandemic. I'm sick and tired of being furloughed and worrying if my job is safe, cant wait to go back and know my job is safe. I have vulnerable parents who have been shielding and I know they really miss seeing family and getting out and about, family zoom calls have been a weekly thing but it just isnt the same.
