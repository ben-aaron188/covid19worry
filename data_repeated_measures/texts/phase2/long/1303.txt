Fairly relaxed and hopeful about the future. Slight concerns a varient will affect the vaccine but overall just looking forward to restrictions being lifted and moving on with life. Being a fairly young and fit person I've never really worried about what the virus could do to me, my main concern about the virus was the risk it posed to my grandparents and parents. Now they have all had the first dose of the vaccine it has helped me relax. Obviously it's still very sad to see the numbers of people dying, not just in this country but world wide and I worry about the effects it has had on peoples mental health especially as I have a partner who works in that part of the health service.
