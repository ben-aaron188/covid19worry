I feel that it is still not be controlled well by the government, as they would rather end lockdown quickly than slowly open things up to the public. I also feel that working at home is quick hard to do due to being easily distracted as well as not having a suitable learning environment to study and work in. I am relieved to hear that vaccines are being created and used to counter covid, and hope that the pandemic ends by the end of this year. I found that the lockdown did not impact my mental health but has made me very unproductive and lazy.
