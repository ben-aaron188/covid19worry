I feel a bit upset as I’ve lost a lot of money since last year and no work has been bad for mental health not just for me but for me and my friends also which is sad.
I hope it will improve this year so that I can continue with my career and my future goals, however I’m not sure it will this year maybe next year,
My family have been very important to me and thanks god I live with them or I don’t know what I would do, 
I wish to know what the future would hold so things can go back to reality but I’m not so optimistic as we have seen what is capable of this virus
