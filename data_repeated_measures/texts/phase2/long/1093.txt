I am feeling Fed up of the current COVID-19 situation  wanting to be able to do things again in the future feel like we’re wasting life. The constant uncertainty is draining mentally.I doubt we will ever fully go back to a pre Covid life this is the new normal I fear will stay now. Human beings need to socialise and work!I fear for my children paying for the loss of education and the tax costs that’s will come to them later in life due to this situation. There will be a massive divide in the rich and poor homes.
