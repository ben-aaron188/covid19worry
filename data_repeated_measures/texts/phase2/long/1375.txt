I am still scared and worried me or my family could get it and get very ill but if this plan to get out works then I’ll be happy and I feel slight hope right now.
I’m staying very optimistic as I’m still 50/50 whether we will be able to actually have a summer where we can do stuff and have fun! I still get annoyed when people break the lock down rules a lot as it’s not fair on the all us other that stick to them and haven’t been able to see family. I wish they got / get caught as it’s not fair when lots of us haven’t been able to see our family and friends and comfort them when they have been ill or lonely. I feel like wearing face masks is a good law but a lot of people don’t care which angers me ! Some people don’t bother wearing them, some will wear them wrong with their nose out or them wonky and not properly covering the mouth and nose which is frustrating as all the nhs key workers have to wear them constantly all day! I wear one all day nearly every day and it’s not nice to wear at all it gets hot and horrible but we do it to save ourselves and other people and when I see someone not caring and only wearing a bit of it and not properly it does anger me as it’s such a simple thing to do and people can’t even do that!
