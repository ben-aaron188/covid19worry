I feel confident the situation is going to improve now that we have a vaccine and a roadmap to get things back to normal.
I feel more optimistic and can start planning things and that makes me happy.
Overall I feel like we are on a good track and I am very impatient to be able to socialise and have wonderful memories again.
I look forward to kids going back to school too, they have been resilient but they also miss the social interactions and being taught in person.
They have had moments of boredom and lethargy.
Overall I think things are on a good path to get better and we can resume our lives as we knew them before
