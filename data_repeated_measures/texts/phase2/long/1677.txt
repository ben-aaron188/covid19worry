I feel like we were just starting to be hopeful about a genuine beginning of the end of the pandemic but all the talk of a third wave and it being harder to control than the previously ones has really added to my anxiety and leaving me feeling a bit hopeless and sad. Iâ€™m also sad about all the things that have been lost as a consequence of trying to survive the pandemic. Im lucky to have not lost anyone close to me so far but I do know people who have been ill and a lot of people who have lost livelihoods and possible futures. 

The thought of how things might struggle to get back to normal and the fallout from the pandemic that will probably last for years to come also add to the sadness and hopelessness.
