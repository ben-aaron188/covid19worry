At the moment I feel quite hopeful. With the vaccines coming out, I feel there is hope in the world that things will go back to normal soon. I feel that people are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and if people just stick to the rules, we will be there in no time. It has been a sad time for many people and quite a hard time as well however I believe that we are heading towards the last fight and am hopeful we will get there soon enough. For now we need to work together to keep everybody safe and stick to the rules that have been set out for the country to follow.
