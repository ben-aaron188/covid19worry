I am worried and want to know/ be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but I can’t see where it will end. It’s an uneasy time, and I just spend most of the time hoping for the best. I am willing to get the vaccine as soon as it becomes available to me. It feels like the whole year has been wasted since corona came around a lot of life has been put on hold. Hopefully a year from today everything will be back to some kind of normal , but probably not the normal we knew before. Life will forever be different now
