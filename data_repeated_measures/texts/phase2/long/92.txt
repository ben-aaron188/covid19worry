I feel that although within the uk there are glimmers of hope with the vaccine i still feel very sad. Whilst my family and i have been very lucky the repetition and monotony of the situation are grinding me down and sometimes it feels unbearable. When sad/down previously i have always been able to reassure myself that it was a temporary situation and that things would change, now i don't feel that and i am sad and afraid for my children's future. The covid pandemic seems to be intersecting with a lot of other things that i am worrying about, climate change, problems at work etc, and everything feels hopeless. Not every day is miserable, we can still have fun together but i still repeatedly. return to this state of sadness.
