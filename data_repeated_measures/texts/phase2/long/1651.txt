I'm angry at the UK government for how they've 'handled' the whole Corona situation. I do not believe the new 'roadmap' should have dates attached to it because nobody knows what is to come and it creates a false sense of safety and things will be 'normal' imminently. It makes me frustrated and sad there wasn't more of a global effort to combat this virus but the UK Tory government are severely responsible for the amount of Corona-linked deaths and I fear they will never be held properly accountable. I'd rather continue being cautious and support the rhetoric of ""these particular restrictions will ease once there are 'x' amount of cases"". Alas, that isn't the case, and I fear what's to come in the future.
