I feel slightly more positive than I have previously. The vaccine roll out is going well and cases are improving. I feel optimistic for the summer ahead and I feel that we are at the beginning of the end. I feel frustrated that I've not been able to see family or friends for such a long time, but excited for all the plans I've made to make up for it. I also feel quite angry towards the government that they made such a mess out of the Christmas regulations. Finally, I feel quite anxious about what the new world will look like post-covid including working from home and what the long lasting impact will be on the economy.
