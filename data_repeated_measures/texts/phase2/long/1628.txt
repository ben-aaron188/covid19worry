I think it's a dangerous thing but we shouldn't ruin the economy and lives because of that. We should protect those who are the most in the danger and keep the world going. There are anxieties and many other mental issues which are coming from being in lockdown. Also, I feel that many people who should give us the example break the rules while they tell people to stick to them. It makes people thinking about strange theories and not follow rules at all. 
I can't wait to come back to normal life. I don't think coronavirus it's a hoax but now I think that we just overreact.
