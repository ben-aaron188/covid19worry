I had a notification from a new provider earlier today to advise the R rate has increased which has left me feeling concerned - especially as I have young family members returning to school on Monday and I am worried for their health, and for the new variants to be given more of a chance to circulate. I am worried that the government is opening up too quickly and we will be faced with more issues because of this. I am concerned that people have become too relaxed and have noticed people wearing face masks less where I live, which angers me.
