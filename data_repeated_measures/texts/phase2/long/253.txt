I have had my first vaccination but my husband hasn't. He restarts work on Monday 8th March and I am worried the virus will increase within the community and will put him at risk. This makes me really scared. I am also worried that the EU will withhold the AstraZeneca vaccines from the UK and we will be short of the vaccine. I have seen what they have done to Australia. I am therefore worried that we will suffer and see more deaths. I also have an elderly mother who is suffering mentally with not seeing family.
