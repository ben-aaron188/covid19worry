The situation seems never ending even though there is an end in sight (hopefully). I hardly leave the house as I feel anxious about catching covid. I can't wait untill I can go out to do leisurely things again and missing my family which I am finding difficult. I hope the vacine will ease infections so the world can get back to normal again and I can and everyone else can get their freedom back. I hope this will be the last national lockdown to try and make up for lost time that we have all missed out on and hope that infection rates do not soar again.
