I’m exhausted. Working in the nhs and with kids. I’m exhausted. Slightly anxious about the months ahead in terms of work and just drained. Motivation is dropping and energy levels are low. I need a holiday, something to look forward to. I feel all I’ve done is work and try and manage the house and the kids. Home schooling is hard. Overall we are ok but the length of time working at this level, juggling it all. We all especially the kids miss family, miss friends, miss their connections. There have been silver linings- job security, plenty of overtime and I’ve been able to reduce the debt which will be positive for us in the future.
