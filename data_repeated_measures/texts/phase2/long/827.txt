Having had my first vaccine I feel a lot safer and am looking forward to the easing of restrictions and getting back to some kind of normality both personally and professionally . I have a greatly reduced level anxiety in catching Covid and confidence that if or any of my family do catch it we wonâ€™t die, and I would dearly like to see my parents and hold them especially my father who is battling cancer. I do have a lot of hope for the future and for the rest of this year. The success story of the development and deployment of the vaccine in this country is something we can all be very proud of.
