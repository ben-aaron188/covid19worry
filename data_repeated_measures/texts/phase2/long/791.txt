I no longer feel that anxious about what harm the virus may do. I am now more anxious about what the world will look like going forward and a bit worried that it seems to be dragging on and on. But all in all I'm happy/relieved that the world is not ending like some were saying early last year. 

 I am also relieved as my biggest concern when all this started was for my elderly relatives and thankfully none of them have succumbed to Covid.

I am eager to resume my pre Covid life as soon as possible.
