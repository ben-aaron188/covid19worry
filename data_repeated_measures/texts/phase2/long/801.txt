I work in a hospital, colleagues have to work from home three days a week. Masks worn every day. Full cleaning guidelines. Every day feels like Groundhog Day. I worked right through the initial lockdown as I am unable to work from home. Clinical colleagues seconded on to wards. Relationships with colleagues quite fraught. Guidelines changing from day to day. Clinics had to be cancelled and then rescheduled later last year. Clients cancelling or not turning up to appointments. Colleagues off with covid or stress.
