I feel happy that the end is in sight, in terms of things going back to a new normal. I fear it’ll be an ongoing part of our lives now that will always be around, but am hopeful that science will help lead the way. I’m frustrated it’s taken this long as it’s put everyone’s life on hold and has definitely fed into the pockets of the big pharmaceutical companies, and changed how we see politics (as someone in their 20s). But makes me hopeful for a changed future for the better. It’s be incredibly frustrating to see people break rules, both on a national level and a local one and j wonder if that has actually made much difference.
