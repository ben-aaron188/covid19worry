I am appalled and angry at life after coronavirus. I am trying to stay positive but it is really hard to do so. Life has become worse both financially and mentally for me, and I am unable to achieve my goals as quick as I would like to. I cannot travel as much or see my friends as much I would like to and this has taken a toll on my mental health too. I would like my government to handle the corona situation better than they have before and to stop acting so foolishly and breaking the lockdown rules themselves.
