I am more worried for the safety and welfare of my parents than that of myself, as they are over eighty. For myself, I am just concentrating on not going out and avoiding unnecessary journeys to reduce risk. , until I get my vaccination. I am happy to stay at home, as the risk of catching Covid when out in the community means that it is not worth it. I think that we will not resume 'normal' life until 2022, however, so I don't think that I will holidaying abroad until then. The vaccination take up in this country will hopefully mean that it is safer to stay at home.
