I am relieved the vaccine roll out is going so well and that we're already at vaccinating 55-59 yr olds, but very worried there'll be a rise in cases again as we come out of lockdown and we'll be back in the same position of immense pressure on the Nhs and end up back in lockdown once again.  I'm also worried about the expectations people have once lockdown is lifted and that people will forget there is still a great risk.  I'm also worried about how the economy is going to survive this, with high rates of unemployment
