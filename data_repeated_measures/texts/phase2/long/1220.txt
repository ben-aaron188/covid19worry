I really want to go out with my friends. Sad about missing out on my last year of university. It is hard to work from home. Masks are annoying. We have to wear them at the library so it puts me off going.  Want the gym, want my friends, want my life back. It is so so rubbish. Very hard to maintain your mental wellbeing when you have to stay inside. I have been sleeping a lot more than usual with a lower mood than usual.  I am very excited for corona to go away so I can go on holiday, see my friends and see my family properly.
