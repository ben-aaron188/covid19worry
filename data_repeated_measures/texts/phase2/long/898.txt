I feel very angry about the lack of leadership from the government and how poorly the UK's situation has been mishandled. I feel very isolated from my friends and family and even basic interactions with other people give me anxiety. I feel disconnected from reality as I feel like I am not currently existing in the real world. I have been using drugs almost every day for a year to cope, and have smoked all day every day most days. I have received terrible support and guidance from my university and I am having to consider resitting my third year due to the poor planning and lack of support from the government. I am doing terribly financially and I am struggling to stay out of my overdraft.
