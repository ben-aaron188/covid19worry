Am feeling quite positive as numbers are falling in most areas including mine. Myself, husband and 2 children have happily avoided virus and outlook is nowhere near as bleak. My only apprehension is now ive had my first vaccine will there be ample supplies for 2nd dose and do they really work?
    There has been no hige spike since schools returned, so hopefully when next restrictions are lifted, people will take responsible day to day actions but i fear that ignorance and stupidity will come out tops again and the public will be carefree.
