Although the vaccination rollout is underway, I'm still worried about the coronavirus situation - especially given the new variants of the virus that have emerged recently. I'm also disappointed with the way that the government has handled the pandemic, both in terms of containing the spread of the virus and in making sure British citizens have the economic resources to survive during these trying times - which doesn't fill me with hope as to how the government will likely act post-pandemic. That said, I am very excited to receive the coronavirus vaccination and I am beyond impressed with how the NHS has handled the pandemic.
