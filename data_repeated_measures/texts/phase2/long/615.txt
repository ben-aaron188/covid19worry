I do feel anxious about life returning to 'normal'. It's been a year of living like this and I almost feel like this is my normal now and I'm anxious to go back into work and socialise again. I'm worried how my life might change as I've become used to this way of life. It would be lovely to see friends and family once again and hug relatives but I am anxious to go back to work as my work-life balance and mental health has improved significantly since working from home. I hope employers see this as a good opportunity to allow more remote working to better the well-being of their employees.
