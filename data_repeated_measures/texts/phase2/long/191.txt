My first thought when Corona virus is mentioned is about the mutations that are appearing. I have only a mild concern that they will become a problem but a huge concern that the government won't be able to cope with another wave of, possibly more lethal, disease. Having had my first dose of the vaccine I'm telling myself not to fall into a false sense of security. I also know that come what may the British people will bounce back although at the same time I feel that the effects of the pandemic will be felt for over a decade. 
Having said all of that my feelings are optimistic for the future and looking back I've been lucky in that the virus hasn't affected my immediate family badly at all so far.
