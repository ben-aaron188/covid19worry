I am angry at how obsessed those in power are with corona and this has been fed down to the general public.  Other people are dying.  Other people are suffering.  But their needs are not being met because it's all about corona.  I am angry and bitter.  I hate this 'new normal' rubbish - protecting us from corona but  those with other illnesses are left on the periphery of this new world.  And yet so relatively few people catch corona let alone die from it,  But so many people's lives are being ruined by the measure put in place to protect us from it - leaving the in a worse position than if they'd actually caught the virus.
