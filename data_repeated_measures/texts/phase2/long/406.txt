I feel that the global situation is improving, but that a lot of it could have been better if people were better organised and were more agreeable towards social distancing and suchlike.  I still feel there are concerns for the people who are not vaccinated (myself included) and for the elderly, especially in the light of the Manaus strain being in the UK.  I'm happy in a way that the R number has dropped and the figures locally for cases is very low, but I do feel things should have been done differently in the early stages to slow death figures.
