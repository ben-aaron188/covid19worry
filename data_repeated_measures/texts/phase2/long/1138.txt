Bored of doing the same things, a big desire to see friends and family. Struggling to feel motivated.
Sick of watching tv and walking the same walks. I feel sorry for my children who don't understand why and are missing out on so much time to socialise with friends. 
It has made life much simpler but we are ready as a family to get back to some sort of normality. It is very confusing when out and about to see so many cars on the road, it's almost like the pandemic doesn't exist.
It will be something to talk to the grandchildren about in the future.
