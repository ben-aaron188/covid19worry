i am fed up of the situation but i'm still following the rules. i'm looking forward to being able to see who i like and have days out. life is pretty boring at the moment. i hope people follow the rules so things go to plan and we get back to normal soon. i haven't had my vaccine yet and i'm scared of any injections but i will get through it and have the vaccines when it is my time to so i.m doing my bit to help. i'm grateful that all my family are still alive and haven't had the virus and hope we all get through this
