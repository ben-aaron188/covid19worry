I am bored to tears of the whole situation.  I am pleased, however, that we have a roadmap out of this mess and I am looking forward to when everything opens again.

I fear that if we open too early that we will then end up back in a lockdown situation.  I think that Boris has the right idea of opening things on a staggered basis, so that the virus will hopefully not spread again and there will be less of a chance of a variant. 

I am looking foward to non essential shops opening up as I would very much like to buy another cockatiel as a friend for my current bird Freddie Mercury.  Now we have some dates, I am now able to plan for this event.
