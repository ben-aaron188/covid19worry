I am anxious about the relaxing of restrictions, which were announced by the UK government a few weeks ago, particularly because they seem to be very quick and people are planning large events as if the past year hasn't happened. I'm scared that we will end up back in lockdown over winter because everything is thrown out of the window for the summer. 
Since last taking the survey a number of family members have had coronavirus and been very ill and I am still very cautious when I leave the house, which is having an impact on my mental health.
