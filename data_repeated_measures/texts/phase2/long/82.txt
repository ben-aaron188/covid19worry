I am grateful that school has returned for my daughter, but I am still on furlough with no real end date in sight. A lot of my family members have been vaccinated now which is a relief. I am anxious that school will close again and that there will be another lockdown; I don't think I have it in me to homeschool and juggle childcare with no outside help or outside activities (playground, groups, soft play, etc.) again, I think my mental health would suffer to a dangerous extent. 

I think it's nice to have hope about things reopening and going back to normal in the next few months, but I just feel very apprehensive. I feel anxious about the demands that will be made on me once things do open up (family members wanting to meet up, activities with friends and my daughter's friends and their parents) - I'm not sure how ready I am to travel or to be around large groups of people. It's a weird situation to be in.
