The Corona situation has been going on for a long time. I feel the government hasn't really supported the self employed people to well. I think this is forcing me to rethink my career and opt for something else. I'm also feeling depressed and unmotivated to do things. Everthing seems like a big effort. I'm hoping the vaccines will have enough of an impact to change things for all of us in the long run. I've also been disappointed with people's selfishness during these times as evidenced by the panic shopping over the last year. It makes me trust people less.
