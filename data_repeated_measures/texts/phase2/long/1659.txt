I feel that the restrictions have gone on too long. I am a healthy young adult trying to make my way in my career (and therefore contribute) to society. However, all the restrictions have prevented ,e doing so and have potentially ruined the course of my career. The heavy handed approach seems to have no end. This sacrifice was so that old and fat people are more likely to survive. Absolutely galling that the economy has been crippled for the sake of people who have put themselves in a position where they are more liable to ill effects of the virus or people who can more or less choose to isolate if they wish. The pandemic has really exposed the horrific level of health within our population.
