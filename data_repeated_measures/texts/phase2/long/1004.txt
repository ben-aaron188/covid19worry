I am somewhat worried about getting covid, but I am slightly less worried at the moment because I am not currently living with my parents (I normally worry about passing it on to them). I am hopeful because there seems to be some sort of end in sight due to the vaccination programme. I am annoyed at how the government has handled the whole situation, as I do believe we could have been in a much better place at this point in time if the initial handling of covid was better. I am also sad because my life feels like it has been on pause for a long time. I am a university student so feel like these years of my life are supposed to be the time where I can try new things which I can't currently do very much.
