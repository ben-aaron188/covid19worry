I am not worried at all about the whole situation, I think in due time everything will be back to normal so there is really no point worrying because it won't make things happen faster. I personally don't even like engaging in talking about the coronavirus because some people have very different perspectives and they talk about that the government is not doing anything but once again there is nothing you can do about it so for that reason I'm pretty relaxed. I personally have not checked any news at all regarding the coronavirus for about a year just because it's very depressing and not the best for mental health. I'm sure that many people have been depressed just by watching the news everyday saying how the situation is getting worse.
