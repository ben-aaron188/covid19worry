I am feeling fairly relaxed about it. Unfortunately I caught covid whilst pregnant at the end of 2020 and we also lost my husband’s grandma to covid at the same time so the last few months have been difficult. However, my baby is due soon and the vaccine rollout is going well in the UK. A roadmap out of lockdown has also been announced so I am feeling hopeful for the future and like I can see the ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. My mum and aunt are both particularly vulnerable and have received their first dose of vaccine so I also feel more confident that if they were to catch the virus they would likely not be affected too badly. I am looking forward to getting back to normal and spending time with family and friends again.
