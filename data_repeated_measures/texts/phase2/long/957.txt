Angry with the powers in charge of the country at how bad they have been sorting out the pandemic, the missed cobra meetings, the general disregard for their own rules. How so many people abuse the rules on a daily basis and find it funny or have no feelings towards others and how it could effect them. They care about themselves and that is all, selfish behaviour. Cautious about my own situation in making sure I look out for my family and others with my actions and how I can help people out in what ever way is possible given that some people are in a worse position than i am
