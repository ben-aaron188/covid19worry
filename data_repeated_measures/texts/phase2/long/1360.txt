I am sad about how the past year has gone; at some point I was shocked at how long it was seeming to last but now I have accepted that it was handled poorly and I am even more disappointed in the government than I was to start with. On the other hand, I am hopeful about the NHS's vaccination programme and believe it is the key to ending this situation for all of us. I am glad that my parents have had their first doses of the vaccine, though I will not be truly reassured until they have both received their second doses. I am less anxious about myself getting the vaccine although several of my friends have been affected by covid severely. I am bored and tired of lockdown life but I am anxious to return to ""normal"" life because I have been social distancing for so long. The ""new normal"" is an interesting concept to me because I used to have a very socially active lifestyle and these lockdowns have forced me to slow down and I quite enjoy it so I take that as a sort of silver lining.
