Overall, I feel depressed about everything. The corona situation has robbed me of my dream job in America, and is making everyday life a misery. I currently work in a supermarket, and the company doesn’t seem to care about keeping us safe, and a lot of our customers don’t follow social distancing or mask wearing rules. The government has let all of us down with their dreadful mismanagement of the pandemic and I will never forgive them. I do, however, feel optimistic about the future. We have the vaccines and cases are falling, so it seems things might finally get better.
