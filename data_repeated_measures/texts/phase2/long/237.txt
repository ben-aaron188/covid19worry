I feel we are coming out of a dark 12 months. We can start to think about seeing the light again. The vaccination rollout means families and love ones have the chance to reunite soon which fills me with hope and happiness to be able to see my parents again. I still feel extremely sad over the lives lost and how tragic it has been for so many families.

I must be honest with how annoyed I have been with people breaking the rules, many have continued to see family members throughout the pandemic and feel itâ€™s a little unfair when people have stuck to the rules and missed loved ones so much. I wonder how much of the rule breakers result in more deaths, and tougher lockdowns? 

 I am a positive person and I look forward to the future with much hope and desire to live life a little more freely. Cautiously, but freely.
