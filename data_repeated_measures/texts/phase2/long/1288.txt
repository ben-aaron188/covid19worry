given that i have had the first dose of the COVID vaccine, I don't feel like it will affect me as much as it will others who haven't had the jab. I am making sure not to mix with lots of other people and abide closely to the government laws, so for me personally I am not worried about the virus. i do know people my age at university that are going out every night and partying, probably increasing the risk and spread of the virus but I am making most attempts to minimise the risk for me and for others
