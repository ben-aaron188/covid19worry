I am feeling quite fed up of covid. It seems as though it is never ending. I’m a teacher and have worked throughout. Fed up with hearing that schools are closed when they are clearly not!  I am expected to work within close proximity of 30 children but I can’t see my own family. Annoyed that people are still furloughed knowing that the government are stalling the inevitable.  Then the people who have worked throughout will be penalised. We need to get back to normality. I am so sorry that people have lost their lives but would question how many would have died anyway.
