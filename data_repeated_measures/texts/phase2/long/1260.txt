Annoyance at the way the government has handled everything, frustration at losing a whole year of my life to this, terrified about the future as a third year university student with no clue how to get a job considering everything. Sad I haven't seen a lot of my friends in months/a year at this point, nor my family in over a year and 2 months. Homesick as I am an immigrant and havent been able to go home since it all started. Angry my country is ""red listed"" for no reason. Angry at having to pay full tuition fees for lower quality education.
