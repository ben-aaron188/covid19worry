Worried about my family and my own health from the virus and the effect lock down is having on us both physical but also mentally. Also worried about the long term effect of the virus will have on the country in years ahead. Both on health grounds but the wider economy and job market. The future my kids will have in this much hard job market that will be around for years ahead.
Also having to take yearly virus shots each year as new version come out and spread around the world. The fact many of the things i do to reduce stress are most likely to be either limited and not allowed at all for long periods.
