I feel very sad with regards to the Coronavirus pandemic. My dad died in April 2020 indirectly related to this. Since then we have not been able to grieve properly due to not being able to see friends and family, to go on holiday or to have good times with friends and loved ones. I hope the situation improves and we will get back to normality soon. I want to live life to the full such as to complete a masters degree in Vancouver in Canada, to be in a relationship, to spend time playing poker with friends and spending time with my cousin. I want my life back.
