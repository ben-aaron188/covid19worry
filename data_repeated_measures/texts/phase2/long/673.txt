Some of the older members of my family have had their first vaccine so I am feeling a bit reassured and less worried about the virus itself, although I do sometimes worry as from what I have read it sounds very unpleasant and takes a long time to recover from. I am looking forward to my children being able to have a more normal life. I do have anxieties about the impact on my job - my hours have been reduced from 22 to just 8 due to the virus and I am struggling to find a new job at the moment. I do also have a few anxieties about returning to normal as I have got used to life being like this but I am sure I will quickly adapt back to how things were. I think it is important for my children to have a normal life. They have had very little to look forward to this last year.
