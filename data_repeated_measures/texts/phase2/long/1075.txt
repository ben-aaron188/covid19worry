I feel hopeful that change is on the horizon and a sentiment of normality will come back soon with things like non-essential retail opening. I am saddened by Europe’s political agenda to weaken the UK’s role in pushing out the Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine, but I’m glad that at least those in the UK who are eligible so far have been vaccinated and will hopefully get to see their children and grandchildren again soon. I think we will have a 3rd wave at some point in the next few months, but it’ll effect primarily the younger people who haven’t had the vaccine yet.
