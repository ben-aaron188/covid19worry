I am exhausted with and by it. I wish life would go back to the way it was before, we've been locked away for too long now and eventually we will have to live with it as a risk we're willing to take. I think a lot of serious things have been undermined or covered up under the guise of the pandemic, and think this should come to light. I don't doubt that the virus is very real, and serious, however I think it is being used as a way to bring in harsher and more stringent measures to monitor, control and manipulate society by the government.
