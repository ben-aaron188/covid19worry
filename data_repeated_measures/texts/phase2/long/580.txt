i am very sad for the people who have lost their lives, but i am so sick of it now, i just want to get back to normal and get back into a routine of going to work and having structure to my day, speaking to others popping in a shop without worry and not having to wear a mask, this last lockdown needs to be the end of lockdowns and we need to try and start living again. i want to see my family and spend time doing things that we like. hopefully now the vaccine is getting rolled out we may be able to start living normally.
