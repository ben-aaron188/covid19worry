I fell very sad about the current situation and fear for my family and sad because I have lost some good fiends and even members of my family which made very sad. I really also feel very sad because of the uncertainty surrounding the current economic situation. I also mis going out socialising with friends going to pubs and and clubs and goings to gigs. but the most frustrating thing is that i can not travel abroad to some other countries because of the travel restrictions.. but the most important thing that i  feel is worried about my childrens going back to school
