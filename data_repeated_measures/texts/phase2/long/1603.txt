I have a constant feeling of underlying anxiety and uncertainty. I canâ€™t quite place what the anxiety is but have a feeling of an impending doom the whole time. I feel immense relief in moments when I process that nothing bad is happening but then I slip back. I am definitely anxious about returning to crowds and commuting. I spend more time now analysing and feeling bad about gaps in my life than ever before. I realise I have not felt happy or with joy for a very long time. I feel less anxious about the virus itself and more about the longer term impacts on society and the economy and the impacts on children. I am more aware of the vulnerability of older relatives and this makes me more anxious about time apart or disagreements over issues such as brexit and politics.
