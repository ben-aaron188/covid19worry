I feel frustrated and hopeless. I am happy that things are starting to reopen soon but canâ€™t believe that it will all go to plan and think that coronavirus will spiral out of control again. I feel trapped and like I am wasting my life away. Currently I feel like I am living to work and nothing else. All I want to do is travel and see my friends. Not being able to do the things you would usually is difficult to come to terms with. I am worried that normality will never return. I am however excited to have my second vaccine and hope that the vaccine will make a big difference to the situation.
