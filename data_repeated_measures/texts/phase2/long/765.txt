I feel hopeful about the corona situation - things are looking up but I am still mindful that we are not past the finish line yet. I can get sad when I think of how long we have to wait to see friends and be able to travel again but if I focus on one day at a time it is not something that concerns me or makes me feel anxious. Somedays I enjoy the slower pace of life but others I long for life to resume as 'normal'.

At this moment, I am relaxed and have had a good day of work to distract me. I have also spent some of the day imagining what I will do when restrictions are lifted (I keep a list of my ideas). I am currently content and optimistic for the future.
