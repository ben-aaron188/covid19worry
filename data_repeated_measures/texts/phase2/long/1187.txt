I am less worried about the corona situation at the moment than I was previously. Rates of infection are dropping across the country and there is a detailed road map out of lockdown. I have had my first dose of Covid vaccine and it is quickly being rolled out to all adults. My grandparents have all been vaccinated so I am not worrying about them as much as I was. I am looking forward to the days getting warmer and brighter and being able to meet up outside with my family. I work in a school with children who are medically vulnerable and are not yet eligible for the vaccine so I do feel worried that one of them might catch the virus and be very poorly with it.
