I feel sad that as a country we have lost so much - businesses, livelihoods, mental health etc. I do feel more positive about the future but am anxious in case everything does not go to plan. I would hate the vaccine programme to not work now. Freedom does seem within touching distance and I would hate for it to all go wrong. Iâ€™m angry at the government for not acting sooner and for spending vast amounts of money on track and trace, PPE that was useless and to companies who clearly are their mates with no accountability at all.
