I am frustrated that becouse of the virus I can't see my familly, and I can not enjoy travelling and see new places. I am also frustrated that I can't go on holiday abrod. I am frustrated becouse my mam was in hospital in my country and I couldn't go and visit her. I am frustrated that I can't even go anywhere i UK and enjoy new places. I am also frustrated that I can not spend time with my friends.  The only thing we can do at the moment is going to work. That makes me angry and very tired. Not having a chance to enjoy my free time in a way I want is very frustraiting.
