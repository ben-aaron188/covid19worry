At the moment, I feel as though I am stuck, paralysed and inert. I do not leave my house and, I know this is odd, but I do not want to leave my house when lockdown ends. I am fearful. Fearful of the future. Not only are we dealing with the pandemic, but we are dealing with Brexit and an inept, corrupt Goverment. This is frightening. I am scared and I am anxious. Even though I will be getting the vaccine soon, I don't feel as though I will be safe. I lost my job last year due to redundancy and I cannot imagine how I will get back to work. I have very little money to live on. The future is bleak; I am tired all the time and I have terrible thoughts.
