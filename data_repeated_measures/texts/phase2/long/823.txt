I feel very lonely and isolated. I'm not sure how I'll feel when everything starts to open again. I have anxiety of what the next few months bring. The situation is still very unknown and whether or not we are still in lockdown for longer. I have fear that maybe things we never go back to normal and everyone will have to continue living like this. I take each day as it comes and try to not think about the current situation too much. Although sometimes you can not help it as it is everywhere. My feeling at this very moment are very mixed, sometimes I'm happy that I'm working from home and I'm safe however at the same time, I'm very lonely.
