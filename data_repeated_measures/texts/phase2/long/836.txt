I feel sad that it has been such a long time, and we are still stuck in the pandemic. It is upsetting that the handling of the situation by the government has led to so many deaths, and the requirement of a second lockdown. I wish that we had stuck with a strict lockdown for longer, to be in a better position than we currently are in. I have some hope for the vaccine, but also am used to the hope being squished by new issues, so I am reluctant to believe an end is in sight. Additionally, I am upset about the things coronavirus has cost us, both in lives and in how I have experienced life as a Masters Student
