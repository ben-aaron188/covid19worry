I’m feeling hopeful that it won’t last for that much longer or at least won’t in a way that has a huge impact on our lives. I’m also wishing for lockdown to end so I can meet friends and family again as well as hopefully go to concerts and festivals. I’m slightly anxious about the different variants but I’m hoping that vaccines can be easily modified so another lockdown won’t be needed. I’m happy about how the vaccination program has been going so far and it’s relieving to know the most vulnerable people should now be protected and consequently the death toll will fall.
