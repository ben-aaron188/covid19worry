I’m feeling positive due to many people, including myself, receiving the vaccine. However, some of my family/friends are vulnerable and have not gotten the vaccine. This worries me greatly. I hope for a future where covid isn’t our main worry anymore and we are safe and able to be with friends/family again. I will be back to some kind of normality come Monday, due to working as a teacher, I’m unsure how I feel about this due to my safety and others. My overall feelings about covid are that unless everyone is vaccinated then covid is still at large and will confine to ruin our social lives and wellbeing.
