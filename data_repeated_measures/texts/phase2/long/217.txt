I feel optimistic that the vaccines will make life return to a relatively normal state, with hopefully some improvements for people such as more flexible work hours and work places, such as working from home. I hope the pandemic isn't used to increase state power or erode liberties. I hope it shows some of the flaws of our society and how valuable the working people are to functioning of society. I am not worried about catching COVID, just a little worried about my loved ones if they are at risk.
