I feel hopeful that the situation is going in the right direction, but I also feel very anxious about what will happen once restrictions are lifted. I do not want people to simply throw away what we have achieved thus far. We have come too far to just remove all restrictions and potentially go back to Square 1. I feel a bit sad because I feel as though life is passing me by, but I understand that it is the right thing to do for the good of humanity, and that I have many other things to be thankful for, such as my health.
