I feel a little annoyed about the restrictions and uncertainty with regards to my job security as a result. I am self-employed, and covid has had a massive impact on my earnings. I also really enjoying going to the gym and I feel sad that I can't go at the moment. I am not too worried about catching covid, but I am worried about people I know who may be more vulnerable and likely to face serious health problems if they caught the virus. I am not happy with how long the covid pandemic has lasted, and I hope it will not last much longer.
