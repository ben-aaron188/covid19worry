I feel anxious. There is a promise of relaxing the rules in the summer, this is too soon. We have all been accustomed to social distancing, washing our hands and wearing masks for a year and i feel it is going to take time for me to get back to normal. As we gradually open more and more things to normal I think I’m going to find it really difficult to be in crowds of people. I also am going to anxious about returning to the office, as I work in shared building with multiple companies and I’m not sure if they will have the same safety standards as my company. I think I will have to ease myself back into it, maybe starting off by meeting my family for a walk and eventually reaching a phase where I’m comfortable having friends over to my house for a garden party.
