I feel the same as I have done throughout the pandemic. I am scared, anxious and angry mostly. Seeing so many mistakes by the governments and so many people ignoring advice is extremely frustrating. The fact so many people have died and so many families have suffered avoidable tragedies is a black mark on the human race. I am not hopeful for the future as there are a lot of people who still don't get it, or who are far too eager to return to old ways when we are not ready to do so. I would be in favour of going slow and taking time to ensure people are safe and fully vaccinated.
