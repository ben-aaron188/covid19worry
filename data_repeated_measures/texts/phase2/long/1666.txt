I feel really good I've enjoyed being alone with my family .my only worry or fear is seeing everyone when this all ends.its made me realise a lot more of what I want from my life.i have started to invest money for the future and tentatively made goals for a retirement plan.im not worried about the Corona virus, just maybe how people will react when we come out of it. I hope attitudes change with regards to drinking too much and people start to look more after their mental health and get outdoors more often.
