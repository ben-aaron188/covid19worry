The situation is still bad, but it seems like there is light at the end of the tunnel. I have had my first vaccine dose, and am therefore feeling significantly more positive than the last 12 months. I am still utterly furious at the way that the UK government has handled aspects of this pandemic, and I hope that once this is over, some serious questions are asked, rather than just being swept under the carpet. I am ready for this all to be over and to try and get back to some semblance of normalcy.
