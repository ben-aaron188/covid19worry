anxious about people dying before we get everyone vaccinated and also the ones that will refuse to take it, they should be made to.  the government have also taken decisions that led to the death of thousands and yet still ride high in the polls, i am disgusted by this.  they should resign.  i am upset about the nurses being offered a one percent pay rise, all the empty thanks and clapping meant nothing to a corrupt, heartless money orientated government. 
The vaccinations are going well but every action hasd been too little too late.
