THere is a desire for things to become a bit easier in terms of the dangers that are posed by any kind of activities that involve people due to Corona. This is especially strong now since the birth of my first child as I am more concerned for her health since she suffered from a respiratory issue during birth. It also poses a huge risk to my parents who have underlying conditions. Again getting back to a bit of normality would help with that situation. There is not much anger but a bit of sadness at the loss of life and the tough situation some poeple are facing as a result of loss of life and economics losses.
