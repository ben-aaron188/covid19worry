I am very concerned, although the first jab is currently very successful, which is down to the fact it is run by the NHS and volunteers and not the Conservative party and their mates which are making a profit from our sufferring, i am very worried what will happen over the coming weeks especially with the school returning in full tomorrow. This is making me sick with worry that the numbers will rocket again and once again as with september the high increase in numbers will result in another lockdown.
