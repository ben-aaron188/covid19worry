Overblown and a tool being used by various world governments to control the population and economies.
COVID is a dangerous virus, but unless you have a pre-existing illness or condition or are in the unlucky percentage to be affected by it (like the flu), people recover or don't realize they even had it in the first place.

Life needs to go on, as the current social, business, and government actions are killing not just economies the world over, but the Western way of life.

I say this as someone who may be vulnerable to COVID compared to healthy people due to an undiagnosed, suspected kidney condition: it sucks for us/them, but life needs to go on.
