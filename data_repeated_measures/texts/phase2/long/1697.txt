I am bored of the situation and wanting life to get back to normal. Annoyed at the opportunities missed this year due to covid, for example socialising, going on holidays and missing out on my final year of university. However, looking forward to the time we can do all this again when vaccines are fully rolled out. It is a worry at the back of my mind that a new variant might prevent this with like never getting back to 'pre-covid'. Although before I started writing I wasn't thinking about any of that - I was thinking about the stuff I need to do tomorrow while watching TV.
