i feel anxious about the current corona situationa and scared . I am worried everything will start reopening too soon and the vaccines will fail .
With the vaccines now avaiable it gives me a little hope however i worry about their effectivness on newer strains , that seem to be being found on a daily basis . 
I worry that if they allow more people in the country too soon we could face another pandemeic . 
With my children going back to school i am feeling hopeless scared aand anxious because of what has happned in the past with previous lockdowns and things reopepning
