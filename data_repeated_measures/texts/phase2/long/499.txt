I am very anxious about the corona situation as everything feels uncertain and its getting me down. Every day is the same which makes me feel unmotivated and depressed. I try to stay positive but I am concerned the government are setting dates when we can be free from lockdown but I don't think its going to happen because I personally feel the covid cases and deaths are still too high. I feel sad because I want to see my family and friends but don't know when I will be able to. The lockdown has gone on for too long now and things should have been dealt with properly at the beginning of this pandemic.
