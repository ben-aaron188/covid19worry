I am very happy that lockdown is finally easing as it gives hope for the future as cases remain low as planned. I just hope that we don't have another spike that causes another lockdown as I don't think I can deal with another, but I am scared/anxious about the full return to normal life and being close to strangers knowing COVID is still around. 

I look forward to seeing and doing things with my friends and family. I have a few plans post lockdown at the end of summer so hope those can go ahead but have little hope for trips abroad with the rumoured red listed countries.
