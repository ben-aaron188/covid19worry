I am feeling worried about catching it as I'm immunosuppressed, but less worried than before as I have received my first vaccine.  I feel conflicted as I actually like some aspects of lockdown such as not commuting, being able to work flexibly.  I'm sad that my son hasn't seen his grandparents for over a year but also worried about how tiring life will be when we are 'back to normal'.  I'm looking forward to seeing my friends and familya gain later in the year and am hopeful that we might manage a holiday in the UK.
