I feel fine I’m not worried no one I know is worried the situation is a joke to be honest. I’ve been happy at home and home schooling has on the whole been great teaching my daughter. Closing the world and destroying the economy for something that’s 99.% recoverable it’s a joke the economy needs to open up. 

No one I know has had it or died from it all it is flu just renamed exagurated figures to make covid seem worse than it actually is. I won’t be having the vaccine and no one in my family will either.
