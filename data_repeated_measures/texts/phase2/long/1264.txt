Just bored and frustrated at constant lockdowns. Feels like it’s been forever now. We’ve been sensible the whole time and followed the rules but just feeling a bit of fatigue now and it’s having a massive impact on my mental health. I’m much less scared of the physical risk that coronavirus poses and more worried about my mental health. I’m also a bit frustrated that it seems like there are many other people who haven’t been following the rules and who continue to break them, which makes you wonder why we continue to follow them. The vaccine rollout seems to be going well but again, it’s a bit frustrating that older people will be able to get out and on holiday etc. much earlier than us young people who have sacrificed some of the best years of our lives to keep them safe.
