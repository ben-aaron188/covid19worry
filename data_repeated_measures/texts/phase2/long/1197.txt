At the moment I feel anxious about the future and the risk to myself and family.  I am frustrated at the way it's being handled by the government and by deniers.  I am hopeful the vaccine will get everyone together to be safer and start living normally again.  I worry about the long term repurcussions on finances, relationship's and mental health.  I'm not sure that everyone can make a full recovery or that the government is committed to helping everyone.  It's going to take years to fully recover and I don't know if it's even possible.
