I feel quite anxious about how the Corona situation will affect my professional career being an artist and my personal life with regards to friendships, family relations and the chance of not seeing my loved ones for a prolonged time. However Iâ€™m also just as angry at the fact that the government has wasted so much time and money on this situation, and how there is now a new societal divide between those who are pro-vaccine and those like me who are slightly hesitant due to the lack of data surrounding it. 

However I am also reminding myself that life still continues and we simply have to adapt the best we can
