I feel sad because my best friend's father (who was an amazing physics teacher) died suddenly.  I feel tired of all this ****. I feel sorry for small businesses, people who work at the cafes/restaurants/hotels etc. I feel terribly sorry for key workers who work hard and do not get adequate pay. I feel sorry for kids who are unable to attend school, socialize with their friends, play freely, visit their grandparents/aunts and uncles/cousins/etc. I feel sorry for everyone who suffers from post covid complications, depression, anxiety or insomnia.
