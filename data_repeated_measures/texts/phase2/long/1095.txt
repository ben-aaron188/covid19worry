I feel concerned about the new variants that keep appearing. I’m feeling grateful for the vaccine. I’m worried children are being sent back to school too early. I worry for my family members, especially those with existing conditions. I’m worried about my job and how things will be when the office opens again. I also feel worried that we will never get our old way of living back. I feel that our government have acted too slowly and that’s why things have been so bad here. I think the lockdowns have been too short and not enforced enough.
