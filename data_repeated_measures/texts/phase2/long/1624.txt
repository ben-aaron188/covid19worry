I am tired of corona and isolating. It has take the fun out of everything. I am ready to live and explore and see friends and family. I am ready to leave my house and not have the fear of catching corona. I’m not sure about the vaccine as there are various theories out there. It’s poisonous, it’s not. We need two shots 3 months apart. It causes rashes it doesn’t. People that are skipping the queue to get the vaccine while the rest of us way patiently. I was a fan of home cooked food but when this is all over I will eat out, drink out and spend my time outside.
