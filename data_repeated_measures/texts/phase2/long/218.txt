I have mixed feelings right now. I feel positive that the end appears to be in sight but also anxious about returning to normality. I feel anxious about catching and spreading the disease but also anxious about socialising again. I’ve become comfortable in my little bubble and don’t really want things to change too much. I prefer working from home and I’m not looking forward to returning to a cramped open plan office. I’m looking forward to being able to get away on holiday with my family and friends but still keeping a social distance
