i just feel it is all over the place things changing all the time and not to sure what to do . i live in a small county and when going for walks and stuff have to leave it to find nice places but according to rules that isnt allowed and never nowing what to do rights and wrongs. it all just effects my mental states had alot of problems with depression over the last year and with getting layed off right at the start due to being a temp worker its been a very hard and pressing year. really worryied about the future and wheather i can get a job at the end of this im in a very bad area already for this and feeling more like we are heading towards some Judge Dreadd sort of world
