Really fed up with it dominating every single news story. Feel sorry for the government being dammed for everything they, and are not doing. Wish it was over and within 3 months I am hoping it will be. Been working for the NHS, never stopped had a 20% reduction in salary and my workload has doubled so would really like to tell anyone whos moaning on furlough to shove it where the sun doesn't shine! really hate my job and hoping that after I get my second jab I came move into a job that is rewarding.
