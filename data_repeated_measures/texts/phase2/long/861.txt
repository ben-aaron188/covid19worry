I'm scared of a new covid-19 wave because lockdown will be eased soon. I don't trust other people to behave correctly. I'm anxious because I haven't got my vaccine yet. I'm scared my family will get infected. I hope people will follow the rules our government will give us. It's been one year and i can't wait to feel safe again outside. I feel very angry when I see people not wearing masks or walking in groups. I'm scared my son will get the virus at school because parents don't follow the rules.
