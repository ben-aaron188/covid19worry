I am pretty relaxed about the situation at present as I have had my first jab and with the probability that I will return to work on 12thApril I now see a return to my normality.As I now have a timeframe for when,in all probability things for me are returning to normal for myself I feel I can see a clear path ahead as to what I'm going to be doing in the next few weeks as not having a timeframe has been difficult.However,I am eager to have my second jab and this is something I know I have to wait for but I am eager to get it
