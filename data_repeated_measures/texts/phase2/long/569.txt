coronavirus has had very little impact on my work, I've been able to work from home as normal. Although a bit boring, I have been able to save and invest considerable reserves, which is leaving me in a better position than this time last year. this situation does make me feel a little guilty, as others have had pretty bad years. I look forward to a time when I can go travelling again, this is the biggest thing that I'm missing, although i am concerned just how long this will take to get back to normal, and if their will be be limitations or missed opportuntities from before lockdown.
