With the current vaccination rate I feel we are seeing the light as the end of the tunnel.
I am anxious to see family and friends again.
I do have concerns about the effectiveness or possible long term effects of the vaccination, but it is a gamble I am happy to take if it means we can safely visit loved ones.

The paranoia and fear seen on social media news comments has been enlightening, quite worrying seeing how a minority think!

I was asked to write a few sentences, not an essay, this box is refusing me to continue until I have written enough text, I hope this does it...
