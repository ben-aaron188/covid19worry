At the moment I am just annoyed half of my university experience has been ripped away with no compensation. It angers me borders are still open and that we don't have mass testing to allow for events or even activities like the pub as proved in Barcelona with 5k going to a concert. This is a year of the best 'years of my life gone and I'll never get back for a virus that if I got wouldn't impact me as a healthy adult who exercises and takes vitamin D in my opinion. I appreciate that lockdown is needed though for other generations its just frustrating. This whole experience has come at an age I would put last to have it. Now I'm anxious about entering a job market and in fact in the situation doesn't improve lockdown wise have already looked at relocated to somewhere with less draconipoan measures.
