I feel totally frustrated by the whole thing it has ruined pretty much many aspects of my life but I mostly feel frustrated with myself for not using this time to do more. It makes me very anxious and feel overwhelmed by the whole situation. It has made me appreciated more and I can’t wait to get back to some sort of normal life. I can’t wait to see people, go out and for my children to get some sort of education and socialisation back. My youngest doesn’t understand it all and finds it really hard that she isn’t able to go to school.
