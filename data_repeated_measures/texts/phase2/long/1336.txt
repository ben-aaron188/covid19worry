I felt extremely worried and concerned about the virus and the spread, people dying and about my own family. 
My job has not changed despite the pandemic and I’m much more anxious about going out on visits because of this. 
I’ve had the vaccination so I feel a little more relaxed about the situation, but I’m worried about the spread still and how it can affect others. However I’m feeling a little more positive. It is still concerning the that there are new strains being discovered and this is worrying too.
