Nothingness. Groundhog day. Every day feels exactly the same. Wake up, run work, watch netflix, study, dinner sleep, repeat. It's mundane I want a break get me out.

I don't have anything else to add, that's how I feel at the moment. I don't have any more comments to make, considering how meaningless my life is right now considering I'm completing a study which pays less than 4 pounds per hour, which is an absurdity and quite an insult and frankly, shows what a ridiculous society we live in. and I still haven't reached 500 characters! Wow, it appears I'll have to copy and paste this sentence a few times.
