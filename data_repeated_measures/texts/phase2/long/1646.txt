I am currently feeling hopeful about the situation, as the vaccination is being rolled out. I am excited to start getting back to normal life, hopefully in a few months. I am less worried now as the rate of deaths and cases is decreasing which makes me feel more confident that we will have some more normality back soon enough. I am feeling a little less relaxed than I was though as I am starting to get frustrated with spending so much time at home and not having much to do. At first, I was enjoying the time at home but now I am getting a little fed up as everyday feels the same. I would like to see my family and friends and get outside to do some interesting things.
