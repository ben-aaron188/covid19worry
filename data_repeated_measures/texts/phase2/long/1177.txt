Concerned about the reopening of society with the lifting of lockdown restrictions. Worried that number of cases will rise as a result of this thereby impacting the effectiveness of the vaccine rollout. Uncertain about what a post-pandemic society will look like and how comfortable it will be to return to past behaviours. Hopeful that the vaccines will allow a more normal life to resume. Looking forward to being able to see loved ones again. Concerned that new variants could undermine the work done so far with vaccines
