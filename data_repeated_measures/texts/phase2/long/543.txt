Right now I do feel a bit better about the Coronavirus situation.

After a couple of false dawns, I think we are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel

My parents who are in the vulnerable group as is my partner have all had the first dose of the vaccine which eases my mind a lot
I still am waiting for my dose and every day like today when I have a bit of a fever or couch I start to worry I have gotten the virus again

I hope by Autumn at the earliest that we can have some sort of normality in our lives again
