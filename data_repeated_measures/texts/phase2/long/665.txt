The vaccine rollout has gave me peace of mind about my own health as well as my families. However, as much as I am not as worried about corona affecting my well-being, I do think it has had a negative impact on my mental health. It takes a lot for me to focus doing university work and I lack the energy to get up and exercise that I used to have. I also sleep a lot less than I probably should. However, the announcement Boris Johnson made recently has definitely gave me a lot of hope and I am not feeling as negative as I have been.
