At this moment in time i feel a bit more settled than a year ago i was so so scared then but now not so because i have had my first jab , this makes me feel ever so safer but i know there are no guarantees.
It does worry me if i get ill and there is no room in hospital for me and this worry has blighted my life in the last year , but now there is a little hope i can soon start to see my family again. In the last year and in fact it was on my birthday my husband was diagnosed with cancer and all his hospital stuff carried on as normal but the stress was terrible having to go there so often.We have hope now.
