As a route out of the pandemic looks likely, I feel that the Westminster Government is trying to shift the narrative over their incompetent handling of the pandemic, into one of vaccine saviour. I feel their lack of humility and honesty has adversely affected the public's confidence and uptake of the vaccination program. I am also very anxious over the financial and future life chances of the most disadvantaged in society. As modifications, to existing vaccines, are hopefully effective against new mutations of the covid 19 virus. An annual booster for the most vunerable may eventually be all that is needed to prevent any further national lockdowns. However I do not see the current Westminster Government ""building back better"" on idealogical grounds.
