I have anxiety when around big groups of people due to the Corona virus, such as going food shopping. Although I feel happy that the restriction will be hopefully be lifted soon so we can see our friends and family more, even if it means just meeting outside. Lets hope the weather is nice to be able to do so. I have a fear still that I could catch it and not get any symptoms and give it to a love one who does get the symptoms. Guess we do not know what is going to happen, just hopefully people do not go too crazy and spread it more like last time.
