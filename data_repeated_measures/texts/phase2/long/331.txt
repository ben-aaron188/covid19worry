I am annoyed with the people ignoring the rules, such as breaking lockdown or showing an inability to wear a mask correctly/at all. I am worried about the future of the economy and the thousands of jobs that could be affected. I am bored of being stuck at home and desperate to be able to take my daughter on trips and outings again. Despite all this I am grateful to still have a job and have actually financially benefited in the short term so am aware that my position is actually better than many others.
