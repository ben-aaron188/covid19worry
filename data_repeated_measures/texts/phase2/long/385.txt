I'm feeling a little more positive about things now that the rates are coming down and we're getting closer to getting back to something similar to normal. I'm anxious about the vaccines as I worry that they haven't had long enough to be tested properly and also that people seem to think it's a miracle cure and they can carry on as normal once they've had it, when this simply isn't the case. I'm also a little angry that some people don't seem to treat the situation seriously and don't follow guidelines and are therefore putting other people at risk
