I generally feel quite optimistic, as things seem to be improving in this country and around the world, with a view that the lockdown will slowly come to an end and normality will start to return. As a year has now passed, I also feel like I have grown more comfortable in this situation as mask wearing, social distancing etc now feels so normal. I was also recently vaccinated so I am less anxious about catching the virus. I still miss socialising with friends and going on holiday (and even being in the office, sometimes!) but hope these activities might resume relatively soon.
