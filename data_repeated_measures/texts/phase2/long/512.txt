I'm still concerned that we're opening up too quickly, our government seems to fold every time the business sector even mildly leans on them and it just gets us in a cycle of lockdown, then reopening, then infection rates predictably soaring, then lockdown again. We would probably be in a much better place if restrictions had stayed somewhat strict until vaccines were ready and at least partially rolled out.

Other than that I'm not especially looking forward to finding work again and feel rather down on myself for not making better use of my free time.
