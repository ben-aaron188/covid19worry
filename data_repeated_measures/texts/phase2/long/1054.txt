I feel sad that my children have missed out on so much school. I feel sad that I have lost my business because of the situation. I feel anger that the government have not listened to experts and that perpetrate fear and have made people scared of people. I don't like seeing covered up faces and I worry about the impact on peoples mental health. I do not want an injection and fear that it will be impossible to live again as we once did. I worry my children will not have the school and university life that I had. I wish this had all never happened. I know more people that have dies from mental health issues during this time than covid. I live in a large town and I don't know anyone who has had covid, yet the fear surrounds us everywhere we turn.
