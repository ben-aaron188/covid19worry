I am now so bored of lockdown! I just want it to end and have some normality in my life... I don’t hear of anyone close to me getting ill so I do sometimes question why we are in lockdown still. I cannot wait to see my family and colleagues. I do not want the vaccine but I just want to get on with living my life. A lot of the people I know are feeling the same. I want to be able to go out freely without “breaking the law” although I’m not so bothered by going on holiday as I’m more concerned how inflated the prices are going to be. I’ve been working from home for the last year and I’m so lonely
