I am fatigued by it all.  But I also feel like it has been going on that long we have become desensitised to it.  I feel safe at home and still don't go out unless its necessary.  We do most of our shopping online including grocery shopping.  I am worried about my son going back to school on Monday and my daughter returning to university.  I have felt relaxed at home although I have been worried for the health and safety of friends and family.  I just want everything to be over now and SAFE and get back to normal.
