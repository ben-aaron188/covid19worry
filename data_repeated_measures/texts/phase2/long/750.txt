Missing my family who I have not seen in 16 months as they stay far away. This is affecting my mental health. But also enjoying more time with my 5 year old son. Upset at the things he can't do that he loves such as swimming and soft play but he is enjoying more time outdoors riding his bike going to the park etc. Worried about catching covid even though I have had the vaccine as I am a key worker and could pass it onto vulnerable people I support if I did not have symptoms. Looking forward to doing simple things like meeting friends for lunch. There are pros and cons to the lockdown
