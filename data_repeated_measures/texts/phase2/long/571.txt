I feel calm and relaxed as I don't believe I have been affected directly by Corona. 

I'm feeling thankful because I still have my job, nobody in my family has passed away and my friends are healthy.

I am enjoying working from home as I get my time back, I also get to avoid the busy London trains and streets which I hated.

If I can continue working from home after the lockdown/pandemic, I would be extremely happy.

I don't feel as anxious, fearful or worried like I did this time last year. I'm feeling hopeful and happier.
