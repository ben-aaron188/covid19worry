Sad but slightly hopeful that the worst is over and things can start getting back to normal very soon.  I am still waiting for my vaccine but my brother had his jab yesterday so it feels that things are starting to move in the right direction.  This year has been incredibly difficult but I am starting to think about planning things for the future for myself and my partner.  I am currently working from home on a permanent basis and am looking forward to getting back into the office and interacting with my colleagues and other people again,
