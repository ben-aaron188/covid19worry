I am looking forward to restrictions lifting in April. I am unhappy about having to return to work possibly in the summer and a concert I had tickets for in June probably won't go ahead. Im less worried about catching Covid than I was at Christmas even though the Brazilian strain has been identified in my local area. 
I have enjoyed many aspects of lockdown , mainly being able to work from home full time which has given me more time to spend on my hobbies and doing things I enjoy which has made me happier overall. I miss my family and I still haven't seen them since last summer and I want to give them their Christmas presents
