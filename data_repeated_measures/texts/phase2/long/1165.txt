Wondering how things will work out later this year. I have a lot of questions that can't be answered right now, perhaps similar to other people.  How well will the vaccine work and will the virus mutate so much the vaccine won't work effectively?  How safe will we be? At this pent moment I'm particular concerned as schools are die to open on Monday.  I have children aged I'm in quandary thinking about whether it's the right decision to send them I n or keep the off. I feel it's too early and our household will be exposed. Were happy at home,  although it had its challenging, it's also quality time as a family
