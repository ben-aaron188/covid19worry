I am tired of being stuck at home. I am worried about my elderly and clinically vulnerable parents I have not seen in 14 months. I am pissed off that I still have not had a vaccination even though I am asthmatic. I am angry about the governmental incompetance and corruption they have shown throughout and their disrespect to our NHS heroes. I and angry with the morons who don't wear masks. I am generally depressed or numb all the time I am not crying about TV shows. Though the television shows were amazing.
