I am so very, very fed up with it all. I am so fed up with lockdown. I think they need the lockdowns for highly populated areas, but not for rural places like where I live. They are ridiculous here, pointless. I am So fed up with people we know not abiding by it. They post photos on Facebook and Instagram going for walks in beaches etc which are say 20 miles from where they live. Yet we are still in lockdown and supposed to be staying local ie the town where we live. We have abided by it even though we live in the middle of nowhere and there are hardly any cases. We have just stayed here for 3 months. We are SO bored. And they are doing the vaccinations so slowly. My daughter is a Vaccinator and there are no shifts for her to work. We know of others with shifts cancelled or sent honestly. I had my first vaccination last week at one of the huge hubs. There were 6 pods set up, but only 2 open. I just want life back to normal.
