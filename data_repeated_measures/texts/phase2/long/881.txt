I feel glad to be able to look forward to the plan of coming out of lockdown. I am not anxious about my daughters return to school and welcome the glimpse of normality this brings. At the weekend whilst driving to a park i was amazed at just how many people were out and about in large groups (over 10 in most instances) without any social distancing. It feels very much like the lockdown has ended already. I feel glad to of not been affected by Covid, but do feel it has been largely over dramatised and I am not one to buy in to the panic so feel calm
