I am currently shielding, as I have been for 12 months, waiting for an operation which has been delayed since nov 2019, therefore I don't feel too at risk, but I am lonely, anxious and desperate for the operation. My wife is a key worker and has worked throughout, although recently the  company has been providing weekly covid tests. Not happy about school reopening next week, we feel this is far too soon. The whole previous year has been mishandled by the government, so much more could have been done. Schools closed right away and learning provided via unused freeview channels, one channel per school year, there is ample unused airspace and it would have been available to every child.
