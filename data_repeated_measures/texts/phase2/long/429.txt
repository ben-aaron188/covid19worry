Right now I am not anxious, I know that should I get it I would likely be fine. However, having lost my fit and healthy Dad, who was only in his 60s to it, I do feel very sad. I feel very hopeful about the vaccine and grateful to the scientists who have developed it and the people who have administered it, but I’m so sad that it came too late for my dad. I’m looking forward to happier times to hopefully come soon. I know there are likely to still be bumps in the road but I do think the worst times are now behind us.
