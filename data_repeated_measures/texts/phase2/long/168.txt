I'm still concerned about the virus especially given that some people will refuse the vaccine. I'm soon getting my 1st jab and have no fear of it. It is a beacon to hold onto , in thinking that in 6 months things might be able to begin getting back to some semblance of normality. 
Still not overly happy with the Govt handling of the situation in the beginning, but the vaccine rollout is going well. Can't wait to see my family and friends again. Being stuck indoors so much is tough and frankly boring, which has led to a ""can't be bothered "" kind of attitude to doing mundane chores. Thank god for online friends.
