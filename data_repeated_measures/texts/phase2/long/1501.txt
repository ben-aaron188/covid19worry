I am currently feeling very frustrated at how this situation has been handled and it feels like there is still no clear end in sight. Despite the vaccination roll out there are still huge sacrifices we have to make. I miss my freedom and being able to live my life the way I want to. 
I feel like the government has been so slow to respond to everything that it is now making the situation drag along even longer than necessary. I am frustrated at seeing how my friends in Europe seem to have more form of a life - even though they have curfews they can still see people in small groups and have some form of social life. I also feel like ordinary people are being blamed instead of being empathised with what is a very difficult situation.
Whilst I understand the importance of following the guidelines it has now gotten to a stage where I am more concerned for my mental state that the virus.
