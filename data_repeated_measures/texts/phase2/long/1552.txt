I am feeling like lockdown is a normal way of life. I look forward to the unlocking.
In terms of coronavirus, it is no longer the sole reason for stress. Things such as work pressure and personal circumstances are now the main reasons that effect my mood. I miss my friends and family a lot as I am from Belfast but live in London, a lot of my thought is forward focused on when I can meet up with them rather than what’s happening in the here and now. I’m also a special needs teacher and have worked throughout the pandemic. Travelling to work each day give me a focus, and continues to detract from focusing on covid.
