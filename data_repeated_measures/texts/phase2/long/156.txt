i have just had the jab yesterday but even before the jab with the elderly having the first doses i was beginning to feel less anxious.

Now after having the jab i am a lot less anxious but still realise that i still have to keep to covid rules.

i am still worried for those who will not have the vaccine  and what will happen to those unvaccinated  although every tell me the average death rate is still 80

i am also thinking of the covid mutations and whether we can keep up with the vaccine.i dont like to vaccinate often so i am not wanting this covid vaccine to be an annual vaccination.
