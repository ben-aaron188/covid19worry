The anxiety and fear I felt when this all started has passed. I’m now just sad that the world has been plunged into this situation, that people are dying, that people aren’t taking it seriously. I’m sad that I’ve missed out on important memories and milestones. Sad. That’s the only way to describe how coronavirus has made me feel now. I guess there’s also a glimmer of hope, with the vaccine rollout. But it’s only a small glimmer, I don’t have high hopes for any sort of the previous normal to return any time soon.. and that makes me even more sad.
