I feel  hopeful that things are getting better the covid infection rates are decreasing and there are fewer deaths this week.  lm in a better space mentally compared to before. I'm  hoping life will gradually get back to some sort of normalcy. The situation currently is not as bleak as it was at the beginning of the year and I'm coping with the present Corona situation much better than I was previously. I'm feeling optimistic about the future and look forward to the Summer as this will help lift my spirits and hopefully  I will be able to visit my family and friends, go out a bit more.
