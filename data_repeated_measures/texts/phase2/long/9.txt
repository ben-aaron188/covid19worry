i feel like this country cannot keep people locked down until june when the nhs isnt under as much pressure. it is ruining the economy and people health is at more risk of other problems rather than covid. i feel the unvaccinated people shouldnt also be penalised for the decision they make to not get the vaccine. i think its wrong to be kept locked down now when cases are so low. people need to learn to live with the virus, we wont eradicate it and we cant stay inside waiting for an impossible scenario
