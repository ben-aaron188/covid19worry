I still feel very sad about all the people that have unnecessarily died, and worried that my parents are still somewhat in danger as they’ve not received their dose of the vaccine yet. I am less anxious than I was a few months ago but I am sad to how this year has negatively affected my mental health and potentially my future - I feel my career has been negatively impacted and I will be undergoing treatment for my depression for years to come. 
I am afraid that people are becoming complacent with the rules and I am worried things will get worse once schools go back this week. I am more hopeful than I was about things in the past but it’s still overshadowed by fear and worry.
