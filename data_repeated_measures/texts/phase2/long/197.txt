I mean, if I look at the news, it's all panic panic panic! And it makes me stressed. New variants, locate the source, blah, blah. I haven't had a cold or flu since I was 11 years old so these are things that happen to other people, but the media has held me hostage for an entire year despite the fact that I'm not at risk. It's taken me the best part of a year to finally find someone I know personally who has had it; an elderly couple in my village who have been shielding and are both in an at risk group (the lady got it while having her covid vaccination and passed it to her husband). One year to find someone I know personally who has had it, in an at risk group and they were fine. They said it was a bad flu and nothing more. Sick of all the scaremongering.
