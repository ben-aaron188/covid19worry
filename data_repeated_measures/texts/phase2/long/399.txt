At this very moment i am currently hopeful about the pandemic nearing a point in which life can be allowed to return to somewhat normal. I am excited to see venues and other locations scheduled for reopening. I am also glad to see that the majority of the vulnerable people through the UK are being vaccinated and are much safer to the more dangerous side effects of corona virus. In terms of the virus itself i am no longer worried for my loved ones as they are much more protected from the virus or have already had the strength to pull through having the virus.
