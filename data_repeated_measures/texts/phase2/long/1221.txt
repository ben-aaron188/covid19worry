I'm still really concerned about covid. So much has happened this last year and so much loss.  Covid is terrifying.  I'm not in the first 9 categories and not sure when I will get the first vaccine. Until then I feel exposed. I rarely go out but my son is due back at school next week and I cannot keep him off for his sake.  I think if I catch covid I will get really ill and worry I will leave my children with no mother.  New variants worry me greatly and there have been some found in nearby postcodes to mine.  It feels like we are so close yet so far and have been through so much.
