At this present time I feel relatively optimistic about coming to the end of the coronavirus pandemic. I feel hopeful that we will be able to stick to the timeline for coming out of lockdown and that things will return to normal soon. I feel we are hopefully now over the worst of it and the number of cases will continue to decline, mainly due to the vaccination programme but also the lockdown rules. I am most looking forward to being able to see my family after the pandemic is over, as although I have really appreciated the additional time to work from home and spend with my partner, I have really missed seeing my wider family who live quite far from me.
