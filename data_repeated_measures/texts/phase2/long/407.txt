I gave birth during the first lockdown and I'm worried about how the effects of covid are having on my son and I. He hasn't interacted with any other babies due to restrictions and also my anxiety around covid and has grown a very strong attachment to me. I feel I have lacked the support and socialisation from friends and also professionals that I have needed as a first time mum. I feel anger towards how the government have handled the situation, and also towards the people that have ignored restrictions.
