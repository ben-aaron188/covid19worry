I feel cautiously optimistic. Many people I know are getting the vaccine which I think is good, although obviously I am still a little worried about the situation especially for the rest of the world who maybe aren't getting the vaccine so quick. I am studying and finish for my summer break just before the UK lockdown might be lifted, this is allowing me to feel at peace with the current lockdown and accept it. I do not mind being stuck inside when I have something to focus on. Last year I had nothing to do and that was much harder for me.
