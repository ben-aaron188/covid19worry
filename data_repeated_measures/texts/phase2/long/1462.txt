I am hopeful that we are moving in the right direction with the vaccine rollout, but sad for everything we have missed and the people we have lost. Just wanting to get back to living life rather than just surviving. I am also worried that new variants may affect the vaccine and halt the progress that has been made, so many people have lost lives and livelihoods and those who are still working we seem to be working just to pay the bills, the fun of life seems to have been taken away. I feel bad for my children, my son who is in year 10 and has missed so much school I dont know how it will affect his GCSEs and my 20 year old daughter who has no job and it is affecting her mental health and can't see how things will improve. And the worry of the countrys debt and how we will recover from that.
