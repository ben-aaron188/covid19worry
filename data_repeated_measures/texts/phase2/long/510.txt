There feels like for the first time a light at the end of the tunnel. But the effects that it has had are going to be long lasting from education and peoples money situation from not being able to work to mental health. 
I do hope soon that normal life can be resumed as long as there is no longer a threat to people.
I feel better about the situation as a whole as the vaccinations are ramping up and soon normality will be slowly resumed. I am grateful that I have been able to continue to work through this time and am lucky that my life hasn't been too affected.
