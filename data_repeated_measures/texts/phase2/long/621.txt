I am absolutely fed up. I'm so utterly bored and fed up. I want to eat in a restaurant instead of doing dishes every single night after eating my bog standard crappy cooking. I want to be able to fly home to Belfast and see my loved ones as I moved right before the pandemic and now haven't seen any friends or family in 18 months. I can't make any new friends as there are no social opportunities. Book club is cancelled and you can't make friends over random Zooms. I want to go to the cinema for date night and see a new film instead of watching Netflix on the sofa again. I want to go get a coffee with a colleague during my lunch break instead of shoving a sandwich into me in my spare room because I worry that because no one can see me, work might think I'm slacking. I wish I could have normal conversations witj colleauges rather than worrying about how things come across over email or having stilted phone calls because you don't know what their take on things are. I started the job just as lockdown started and have no idea whether I do tasks the same way as everyone else or take the same length of time. I have ran out of things to talk about and spend my time off half wishing I was at work so I'd have something to do. I understand why the restrictions are in place but am so frustrated that what should be the best time of my life is just being wasted sitting watching tv.
