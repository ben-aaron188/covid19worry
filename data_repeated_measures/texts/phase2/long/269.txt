I am not sure what to believe anymore, I trust none of the stories that are forced on me at such volume that it is overwhelming. I feel apart from everything and am just watching it play out without any strong feeling either way. It seems like if the situation doesn't end soon, it never will. To summarize I feel mostly numb and want to escape from everything and just watch the situation play out from isolation. 
I can't expand on this any more and the character limit is pretty big, or something is wrong because this is much more than 500 characters
