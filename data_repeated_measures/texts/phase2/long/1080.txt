I am feeling more positive now we have a vaccine. I have also managed to lose 6 stone in weight since May 2020 so I am now not as worried for myself if I do catch COVID. I am very happy the children are going back to school on Monday and can't wait for them to be able to start enjoying life again. I feel relieved the home learning is over and hope our normal relationships resume. My Grandparents have had their vaccines and my parents will be next, we cant wait to be able to meet up with everyone again in the future.
