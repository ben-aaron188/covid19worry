I feel anxious moving forward what is going to happen and whether there will be another spike of cases and how people will be once lockdown restrictions are lifted. I am still hesitant to go about normal activities due to me trusting those out there to follow the rule as I do not believe many have. I'm sad a lot of things have happened over the year, it has been an extremely tough year for me and been a struggle at times. There have been few happy periods and I can't wait till things improve so I can feel happy again. Overall I am feeling hopeful for the future but that is in a year or so.
