I’m less worried about covid because the vaccine is rolling out and I’ve already had my first dose. I would really like to get back to living my pre-covid life as soon as I can, because I miss it a lot. There are some friends and family that I’ve not seen in over a year and that makes me incredibly sad. I also study at university and that’s also been really difficult as my course requires in person teaching and studio space. There have been so many missed opportunities and memories due to this pandemic, and it angers and upsets me.
