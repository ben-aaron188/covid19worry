I am slightly worried about the pandemic situation. I think people are starting to get fed up, want things to go back to normal and so it may be being rushed through before we can be completely safe. I am trying to stay as safe as I can and there are certainly some people that are appreciative of the role of healthcare workers, but unfortunately it seems to be the few ruining it for the many!
Things need to be taken at a safe pace to ensure we do not peak again - though this is likely to happen over winter, but if everyone used common sense, the situation wouldn't be as bad as it has been
