I am sad that so many people have suffered and died from Coronavirus. I am proud of the effort so many people have made in the interestes of the public good.  I am also angry that our government handled it so bacly and condemned tens of thousands of people to death.  I am also a bit anxious about how the government is going to deal with the huge debt incurred, and that the poor will take the brunt of it. But I am also now starting to feel a sense of optimism that, with the vaccine programme going well, that we are close to getting back to some kind of normality soon.
