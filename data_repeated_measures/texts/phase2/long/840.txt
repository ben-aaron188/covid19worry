I feel mostly relaxed about the situation, not necessarily happy but just content with getting on with the current situation. I am a bit apprehensive about the future but not anxious or worried about it. The vaccine is a positive step in the right direction which relaxes me a bit. However I also feel that there is no point getting worried over something I can't control, either we will get COVID under control or we won't, I won't be able to change that so I won't worry about it. The only difficult thing I find is not being able to meet up with people in public places like for a drink after work so I am looking forward to coming out of lockdown.
