Lockdown needs to end sooner than the proposed roadmap. It is insane to think that 'normal' life has been on hold for one year. So much damage has been done to our economy. The government has delayed taking important action to try to prevent the spread of disease. The death toll in the UK is terrible and there should be an independent inquiry into government handling of the early stages very soon. Also, the government must be held accountable for giving contracts, without scrutiny, to party donors.
