overall, i am feeling generally relaxed about the whole situation as things are (hopefully) looking up. whatever worries i had last year had also been solved (family matters have changed - literally - overnight and things are getting better). i've started a new work experience which requires me to go to the hospital twice a week. so my employer has decided to support my vaccination and i have taken my first dose, and i'm due my second one in end of april.

i am only anxious about what i should do after graduating, whether i will have a normal post-graduation experience (job-search, settling down in potentially new location, etc.). i am an international student which makes travelling necessary and it worries me that i cannot travel worry-free, and that quarantine is still a necessity. it seems like time is wasted for quarantining, even though i do know its necessary and i will still do it.

i am quite angry at institutions still for not being transparent in where our money is going to. now that everything is online, i understand that funds are allocated for technical support, but i believe we do not need to pay that much tuition still. my university is also one of those who still apply annual increments to tuition fees, so i wonder where those increments are going.
