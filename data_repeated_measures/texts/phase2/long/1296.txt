At this moment I feel that we are almost at the end of the pandemic and it can't come soon enough as I really want to visit some family in France. My mother hasn't had her vaccine yet so I have often worried a bit about her getting the virus. I'm just hoping that the world will start to open up a bit more soon and we can get back to more normality and I hope for a brighter future. It has been a very frustrating time for everyone but thanks to everyone's effort the virus is mostly in decline so there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel.
