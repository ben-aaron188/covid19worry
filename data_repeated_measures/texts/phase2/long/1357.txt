Things seem a lot more positive than they did a year ago but there is still anxiety that things could go wrong again if people let their guard down or break the rules. However, it does feel that we have gone through the worst and the situation will never be as bad as it was before.

I am also looking forward to a more normal summer and catching up on things that I have missed doing previously. This includes seeing friends and family that I have not seen for many months, and going to places that I have not been able to visit for a long period of time, such as restaurants and bars in my local area.
