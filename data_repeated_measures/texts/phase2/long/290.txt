I am just feeling fed up with it all. I just want everyone to be vaccinated and for things to get back to some semblance of normality. I am also angry at the ineptitude of our government for allowing so many to die and for not giving nurses the pay rise they deserve. They have been an utter shambles; it is embarrassing. The only positives in all this are that people discovered it is possible to work from home if they so wish to do so after this; some people have found great ways to relax; we have a much better appreciation of teachers; and that science and vaccines are still things the UK does well.
