I can't wait for the normalcy of society. I'm just waiting till everyone is vaccinated and free from all this trouble. 
Its been a hard year for many of us, losing family members unfortunately but hopefully with get past this and be more hopeful of the future.       
I want to be able to go out again, visit places and see other friends and family. Being able to go to restaurants, cinemas and sightseeing is something I really miss. I just hope that someday we all have a chance to better prepare for something like this in the future
