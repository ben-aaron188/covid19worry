Uncertain. It's going in the right direction and my mum has had her jab without side effects so that is something. However I am unsure and feel uncertain about the children returning to school next week. My friend has been seriously ill with covid so for a while it was all very close to home but it feels like the threat has retreated a bit and I am quietly hopefully that the scientists can solve the problem but I don't trust our government so things feel like they are rather out of my control. To be honest I have bigger immediate worries in my personal life and so I am less focused on the corona situation than I would be and I am not particularly enthusiastic about getting life back to normal. It doesn't feel relevant to me currently and I am more interested in getting the infection rate as low as possible rather than  opening things up
