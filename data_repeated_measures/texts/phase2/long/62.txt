I feel worried about the future but also hopeful that things are improving. I am trying not to believe it will all be over soon in case we have another set back. 
I feel fortunate to be at work and sometimes that means I can forget this is going on. When the children go back to school it will feel a bit more normal. I am worried I have forgotten how to be myself without coronavirus looming over me. 
I am worried about the educational and emotional effects it may have had on my children and I worry that this has taken up such a large portion of their young lives.
