Currently, as a student I feel happy I was able to return to my university accommodation this term, as being at home would garner greater sadness. However, I have nearly finished my first year which has been almost all online, and the student experience has been thoroughly diminished. I was fortunate enough to have a wonderful flat however. I have anxiety about the future of the situation, whether life will return to normal and whether any part of my degree will bear some semblance of normality. I also worry for my parents, although less so now they have had their first dose of the vaccine.
