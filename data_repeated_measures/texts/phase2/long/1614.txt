I'm angry and frustrated that the government's incompetence has cost us our lives and freedoms. We shouldn't have had to give up nearly 2 years of our lives to begin with. I can't wait for the lockdown to end so I can finally get on with my life. The people not following the rules are ruining it for the rest of us. Many of us have given up luxuries and freedoms to keep our loved ones, and the loved ones of others, safe during this horrible time. Why can't the selfish few do the same? I don't expect it to snap back to normal right away, but I want the end of lockdown to come soon. It cannot come soon enough.
