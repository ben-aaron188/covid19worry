I am worried that we are opeining up too soon but at the same time, know that we need to get back to some sort of normality, It still angers me that people are not taking this seriously and that so many people are stull dying and will die. I am worried about my children who are not of an age to be vaccinated, that they will suffer from the talks of the proposed vaccination passports and will miss out. I wish we didn't have the need for them
I'm finding it hard to imagine going back to normal life - will I be anxious about going to a gig, to a football match? Will we forget as soon as things are open that this is how we lived for a year?
