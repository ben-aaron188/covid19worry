I’m feeling more down as time goes on I just hold on to the hope that the vaccines are helping. I think the cold weather makes it worse I miss my parents as they live miles away. I work in hospital near  home and husband outside so feel so stressed.. Kids go back school Monday it’s a nice normality but still a worry. I hope by summer I will feel better, shops will be open and I may be able to see my parents. I worry about the economy and how we will get back on track and I’m worried about tax increases. Exercise helps as does been outside .
