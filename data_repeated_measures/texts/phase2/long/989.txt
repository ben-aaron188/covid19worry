The situation seems to be under control around the world. I feel we have come a long way since the disease started a year ago. Thanks to science, the creation of a few different vaccines have allowed people to come back to somewhat normal living. There is of course a risk still, but it is not as bad as it was a year ago. Overall I feel hopeful and happy that we will be out of this challenging time in the next few months. People will be able to go back to normal lives, seeing family and travelling again.
