I feel slightly anxious about things going back to normal and going back to the real world again as Iv adapted to this change but I’m also fed up of lockdown so i want things to go back to normal and see all of my friends and go out and about and doing the things I used to enjoy like going to the pub. However I’m on maternity leave at the moment and I’m due to go back to work next month so I feel upset I haven’t had a proper maternity leave and anxious about starting work again after such a long time off and in new conditions. I have to put my baby into nursery so also anxious about them catching Covid there
