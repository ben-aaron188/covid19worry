I feel quite institutionalised by it. I'm doing as I'm told, keeping my family safe at home and can't imagine life returning to normal any time soon. I'm just sad at the time that has been lost and the uncertainty of life going forward. 
I don't feel anger, this situation can't be helped, I just feel so resigned to what will be will be. It feels like we're in limbo and I just hope that at some point we'll be able to move forward with our lives, travel and hug those closest to us. 
I'm happy that the children get to go back to school but nervous about them mixing with other people, potentially coming into contact with covid and bringing it home.
