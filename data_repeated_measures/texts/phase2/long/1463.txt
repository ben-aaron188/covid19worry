I am disgusted at the way the pandemic has been handled by our government and PM. The blatant corruption and theft from the public purse while they should have been saving lives, is despicable. I am awaiting a public inquiry, where I hope those guilty will be held to account. Huge mistakes were also made, that have cost thousands of people their lives. These could have been avoided had we been prepared and not being led through it by someone as incompetent and corrupt as Boris Johnson. His complacency and concentration has killed people and I await the day it catches up with him.
