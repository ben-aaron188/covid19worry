I feel as though people are becoming complacent too early. I understand the excitement but I'm a little worried. I am really looking forward to normality...a safe normality. The pandemic has brought some positives but it has also bought lots of negatives and difficult situations for some. I'm hopeful. 
I'm very much looking forward to seeing my mother sisters and brothers again. I'm looking forward to my son seeing family and friends as he is only small so has missed out on so much interaction. I look forward to going into the office at some point and doing normal things. Like going to bars restaurants and cinemas. That will be great when we can do those things. Even going swimming or on holiday will be great too.
