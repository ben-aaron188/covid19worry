I'm glad that vaccination have started to happen And there getting them done quickly, soon hopefully it will be coming to an end. I can't wait to be able to see my family again. I haven't seen them for over a year and I miss them so much, they live over 200 miles away and can't wait to it's all over, I haven't really been a shop for such a long time. It will be nice to get out and about again and my two kids are really worried and they can't wait to go to school and start going on days out again to zoos and parks and lots of different places
