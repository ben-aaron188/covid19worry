I feel sad that the whole situation has taken over a year to be resolved with many lives being lost and people being ill because our government didn't make the decisions it needed to early on. 

I'm desperate to get back to 'normal life' and see my family and friends but I'm still worried about the virus. I'm annoyed that a lot of people are already breaking lockdown rules because they feel it's over when it's not. Working in healthcare shows me that it's still a real threat to people and it's frustrating that others carry on as normal.
