I feel relatively relaxed about the situation but anxious that it will significantly change in the coming weeks and months, I have a desire for this limbo to end. I feel resigned to the present situation, rather numb to be honest and do not have many feelings about it because of the present lockdown and the failure of life to resume as normal as possible. The situation should improve sooner than i expect and will be relatively uncertain for some time to come although i have been wrong before and we could end up in this limbo for months or years to come.
