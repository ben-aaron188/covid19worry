Not as relaxed as I was for the first lockdown. We are not affected as a family but know extended family members been treated and as luck has it survived the experience. Not being able to enjoy the normal festive Christmas was very hard to deal with. Not a great party person but family means a lot to us. So felt frustrated with not knowing till last moment it seemed we would be able to actually meet as a group. We did get to see son which was great. Outside and within the guide lines. At least now can look forward to the summer relaxation. However still worry about what will happen next winter. Can only hope not as bad.
