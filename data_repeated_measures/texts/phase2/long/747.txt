I am not very worried about it. I do not feel personally at much risk, it poses more risk for society. As we go into the summer it should be much less problematic - just like last summer. By the end of the summer it seems like we will be mostly vaccinated, so next winter should be easier too. I am mostly looking forward to for the situation to be over so I can do things that I am currently unable to do as a result of restrictions to control the virus, such as go to pubs, restaurants and music events. I am a bit worried that the situation might be prolonged by new strains of the virus.
