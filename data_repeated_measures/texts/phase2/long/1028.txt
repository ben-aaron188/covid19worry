I think that the government measures on lockdown went too far,and these restrictions need to go.Also mask wearing is not an effective method of preventing the spread,so this also needs to go.
  I am angry that people were told to take an experimental vaccine which has not been thoroughly tested and I am hearing of some cases of people suffering from symptoms after taking the vaccine and in some cases even dying after taking it.
  I feel that the government is hiding information from the public,vaccine manufacturers are benefiting from an indemnity clause of not being responsible if anything does go wrong with the patient taking the vaccine.
