I am tired of the lockdowns and the restrictions that have been imposed on the whole country and think this pandemic' has been blown out of proportion. We seem to have collectively lost our common sense over the last year.

I think the media are partially to blame for this and perhaps those with a financial interest in seeing lockdowns extended and vaccinations rolled out.

I will be relieved when the country as a whole can get back to some sort of normal life and hopefully not the 'new normal'.
