At this very moment I feel a bit bleak. I'm tired of waiting for life to re-start. I feel like I've been trapped for a long time now and that makes me feel despair, although it's relatively mild now because the end is in sight. I have to remind myself I've been doing everything I can to keep my life moving forward while the country has been on hold. Some days it just feels harder than others. Possibly this is attributable to me getting drunk last night and that causing a low mood today. I can see people out in the street and I know I should get some air too but I can't bring myself to leave the flat. I haven't been out for a few days now.
