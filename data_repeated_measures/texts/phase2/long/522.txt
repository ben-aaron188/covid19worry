I’m disappointed in the government - their response has killed so many. They give themselves an 11% pay rise and the aren’t even working. Yet nurses and teachers (who never stopped working) are allowed to die on the front lines. The government still don’t meet in person because “it isn’t safe too”. It makes me sick. As a teacher, we have been vilified for keeping ourselves and students (and therefore their families) safe and campaigning for home learning.

Everything should be locked down until we are at zero cases. Schools are opening and cases are still higher than they were in October 2020.
