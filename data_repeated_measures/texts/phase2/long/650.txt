Exhausted by it all, it is here to stay.  We will all be paying for it forever.  And the media will be spinning it our forever.  Other important issues will be lost or weakened.  He who shouts loudest.
Ordinary people with ordinary views and lives sacrificed on the altar of media spin.
At home tired of the separation.  My children and husband all merchant navy,  all away for months made to stay on ship for months.  
For all my woke first world doom and gloom - things here are OK.  Everybody is working, we are not losing our homes or livelihoods.
