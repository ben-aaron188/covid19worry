Corona makes me feel sad for all the people who have lost their lives.  It makes me angry that not everyone follows the guidelines which results in everybody having to suffer with lockdowns.  I worry about my family and work colleagues getting it and having to suffer.  The anxiety about working with little children is hard not knowing if they are carrying it and I can catch it.  Hopefully with the vaccine better days will come and a light may well be at the end of the tunnel. Corona has ended all the fun and enjoyment out of life and I canâ€™t wait to start getting back to normal.
