I feel concerned but less than I did. I had a rough few months last year feeling really sad and anxious about everything going on, but The concern that I did have is outweighed now by being excited and optimistic for the next few months. I can't wait to see my family and friends again and for things to get back to normal. I've had a good couple of months because I bought my first home and that has kept me very busy, which I'm incredibly grateful for.
I'm also really impressed at how quickly the vaccines are being rolled out and I'm pleased that my parents are having theirs soon.
