I am really past caring right now as i have lost a few friends, who have died from it, so i dont really worry, as i have and am doing everything,that i am supposed to do, so I dont catch it and so far I havent caught it,
I do feel very frustrated, as every day, i see my neighbours, and people, doing everything they arent supposed to be doing, also all mixing, and not wearing any masks.
People are rude and ignorant, and then, they wonder, why they are catching it?
We will never get rid of it, as people can not do as they are told, Look at the weekend, we had a bit of sun, and people, were out and about, mixing, acting like they have never seen the sun!!
I dispair for this generation, and no wonder, i feel angry and upset, for all the poor people, who are doing, what they are supposed to do, and getting sick.
