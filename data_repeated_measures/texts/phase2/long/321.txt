Having lost a friend to covid last year who was a young bubbly nurse in her prime, covid is a scary thought.  People who don't believe it to be more than flu need to open their eyes and see the bigger picture.  The government has not played the best part in this but ultimately it is down to us to follow the rules and stay safe. The vaccine seems to be having a good impact and hopefully life will regain some normality very soon. This is going to have an impact on the economy for months if not years ahead.
