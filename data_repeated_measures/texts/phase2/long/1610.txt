I am anxious for the end of the restrictions because I don't know how to assimilate into the 'new normal'. I feel quite lonely. I am however happy because I get to spend a lot of time with my family and out in the countryside. I have also had my first vaccination so I feel a bit safer than I have done. My anxiety is largely around my mental health, and how to interact with people. I am also really missing my friends, and as I started university in the pandemic, I have had little chance to make new ones.
