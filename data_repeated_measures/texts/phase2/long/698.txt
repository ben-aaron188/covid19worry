Will be more hopeful when had vaccinations. Still too many idiots ignoring rules. Anxiety that new strains may lower effectiveness of vaccine. Concerns about employment in future if the economy does not recover sufficiently from the lockdowns or another lockdown is needed. Think covid will be with us for many years to come. We will probably require annual vaccination, and risks will get higher like the flu as I get older. Not sure the government could afford to bail out the economy again if new strains mean another lockdown.
