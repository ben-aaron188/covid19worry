I am hopeful because the vaccination program in the UK seems to be the one thing that the UK is doing right. I am very grateful that all the people I care about have not caught this virus and that everyone has been careful to stick to the rules and, now, it feels like the end is in sight. My son goes back to school on the 15th of March, and then things slowly start to get back to normal, haircuts, being able to meet up with family and friends that we have not seen this year is something we are really looking forward to. I am just focusing on the future and keeping busy in the present. We are very lucky to have not been effected by the consequences of COVID, and for that, I am very, very grateful.
