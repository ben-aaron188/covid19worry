I am quite anxious about going out anywhere. I wish I could meet up with friends and family, and be able to plan things for myself and my family in the future. I think people are becoming very angry about the whole situation and not being nice in general. It is hard on my children to understand the way things are and readjust their lives, not always for the better. Everyone just wants a bit of normality and something to look forward to in the near future. I think it is putting strain on relationships and it is definitely not making the world a better place at the moment.
