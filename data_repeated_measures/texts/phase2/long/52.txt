i feel like i can see the light at the end of the tunnel, as many people have been vaccinated (including myself).  i can't wait until life gets back to normal.  i feel sad about the large numbers of people who have died or are still very ill due to the virus.  i am concerned about the effects of long covid on the nhs, which is already under strain.  i wish schools were opening after the easter holidays just to give the R rate a bit more time to settle.  i feel the government have done a terrible job of managing the pandemic and are responsible for the unnecessary loss of thousands of lives.
