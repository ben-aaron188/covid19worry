I have recently moved back home, from a huge city to a very small town. Things are less prominent here, I can go outside without meeting another person etc. It is easier to feel safer and to forget about the situation here. When I lived in the city I thought I could feel its entire population tense in fear of the lockdown, the death rates.
I have lost some of that acute fear and anxiety now. I feel guilt to the friends still in the city that are locked down, and struggle to be understood by anyone in my town, since none of them experienced lockdown whatsoever. 
I am worried about the state of the world, of the mental health of so many many people. I worry about the pandemic fatigue creeping in- how people tell themselves it's safe just because they're tired of the situation.
