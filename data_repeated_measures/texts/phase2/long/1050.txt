Covid-19 hasn't really affected me at all. I've been lucky enough to not catch it, and nobody in my family has caught it - but the fact that there are ""Covidiots"" that are ignoring lockdown regulations and rules is annoying. THEY are the people who are putting everyone at risk because they're too short-sighted to adhere to the government's lockdown. People going out in public without masks or ignoring the 2-metre rule, etc. etc.

Lockdown itself hasn't affected me at all because I rarely leave the house anyways (I suffer from anxiety and depression), so in some ways Covid-19 has actually BENEFITTED me - if I were to go to a restaurant it's now much easier to order what I want via an app on my phone than have to talk to someone face-to-face.
