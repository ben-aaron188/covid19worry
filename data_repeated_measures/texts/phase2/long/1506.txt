Um, well it's nearly at the end... right? I dunno. I'm saddened by the loss of life, and the loss of lived-life. By lived-life I mean, not being able to live life as we normally would for about a year. Relationships, friendships, any other -ships have fallen by the wayside. Some have strengthened--true. But, our Arts industries are almost dead. What's even the point of being alive and human without art? I have depression. Have done for years. I take medication. So I fight a daily battle to try and find happiness--hell, I'd take even contentment at this point--or any kind of hope in an increasingly hopeless world. What even is the world, though? What is the point of it? Life just spontaned on this rock? Give over. I miss the cinema. Going to the cinema was my chief coping mechanism. That has been taken away, and it's kind of a miracle I'm still alive. Or some of the people who live in the same house as me--ha. ""Yeah but you can watch movies at home""-- NO. I don't care how good your home set-up is, nothing compares to sitting in a dark room filled with strangers sharing the experience of viewing a new film for the first time. I have my covid vaccine tomorrow morning. Which, if they've gotten to me this quickly, and all I have is a measly, not life-threatening auto-immune disease, maybe there is hope for the rest, and it won't be too long before everyone has had at least the first dose.
