My first reaction is that 'I hate everything about it'. I know I don't hate everything though. I love working from home and not having to commute 3 hours a day. But I miss my friends, my social life, my gym. This has been one of the most challenging periods of my entire life in my 30 years so far. If I wasn't living with a loving and caring partner, I would be clinically depressed by now. I honestly don't understand how it is expected for people to cope for so long in loneliness, in isolation, in the most unstable job market in decades. It is terrifying.
