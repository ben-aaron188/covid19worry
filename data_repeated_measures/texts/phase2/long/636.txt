I am feeling hopeful that the situation is getting better with the vaccine rollout and a dramatic drop in hospital admissions but still anxious that things will not go to plan. I have very little faith in the government and the way they have dealt with the situation, this makes me sad and anxious for the future of our country and for the economy. I am also still concerned about elderly relatives even though most of them have had the vaccine, we do not know whether this will fully protect them from mutations in the future. I am due to get married in July and feeling skeptical as to whether this will happen or not
