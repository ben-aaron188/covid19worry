I feel anxious for how things are going to progress over the next few months, what it will mean to my changing work situation and how that will change, and when I will be able to see my family next. Everyone seems to think in June everything will suddenly go completely back to normal and I don't think that will be the case. I am a little sad as I have so many friends I wish I could see, some who have had babies during lockdown I have been unable to meet so far. I am quite relaxed as I am good at staying at home but I miss seeing friends and family whenever I want. I also wonder when I will be able to get the vaccine.
