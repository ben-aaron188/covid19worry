I am scared that when the schools open the virus starts spreading again, and we end up in a cycle until we are all immune or dead. As soon as spring comes, lots are going to mix regardless of rules, because they spent winter locked up. Its very stressful. I depended on home delivery before covid due to my agoraphobia but now its so difficult to get a slot. My partner goes shopping and social distancing is non existent. I am on legacy benefits so was not included in any covid relief, I have extra costs due to covid too. I live in a bedsit with my partner, I don't go out and now he can't, its definitely causing tension
