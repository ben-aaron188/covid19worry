I dont have any negative emotions about the current situation. Being informed by borris jhonson that we will be able to go back to normal is very reassuring. Have not felt better than how i feel now for months and am honestly happy. Having stats prove that the situation is getting better has also been very informative and helps calm me down. Not being able to go to the gym has had a negative effect on me and will be happy to go to the gym in april. I dont neccercarily have anything more to add.
