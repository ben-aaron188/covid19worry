Desire to get out and experience summer after getting vaccinated because i was frustrated that we were at home for ages - cant wait for restaurants to open back up again
Happy that alot of people have received the first vaccine in England
Sad since i have adopted well to work from home so I dont want to go back into the office anytime soon
Relaxed because the government has given us dates for when we expect everything to open back up again
Annoyed because even though i want the vaccine i cant have it yet because they are going throught the elder generation and the high risk people first but still... if someone wants the vaccine they should be allowed to apply or be put into a waitlist just incase there are some
