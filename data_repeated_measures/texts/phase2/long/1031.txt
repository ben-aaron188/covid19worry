I feel the situation is hopeful and so I have felt a little reassured, with the vaccine roll out and recent figures indicating more of the population are safer. However, the number of people dying and impact on the NHS is still significant  and so I continue to feel anxious. More and more people are also being impacted by the consequences of covid such as their well-being and jobs, which causes me to feel sad. I also worry about the future, whether there will be further spikes due to variants and this causes me to feel some fear and again sadness about what may be around the corner.
