I feel annoyed that people still aren't taking it seriously and are breaking lockdown rules. I am disappointed in friends who aren't taking it seriously enough and don't seem to get why they ought to follow the rules - it makes me reconsider if they are good people to be friends with. I also feel a little hopeful knowing more and more people are getting vaccinated and that maybe there's an end in sight even though it feels still far away. I do feel fearful about the fact I've not been contacted yet for vaccination despite being vulnerable and worried I'll get missed off the list.
