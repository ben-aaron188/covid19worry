Our government has done very badly at handling this, they have lied and swindled the people. They could have done so much better by caring about the people and not their pockets, by acting sooner, like other countries have done (e.g. China, New Zealand). It is extremely frustrating to see people who clearly and genuinely don't care, to be ""leading"" this country, lying the whole time, openly and brazenly to our faces. The track and trace fiasco is a national disgrace, as is the ""pay rise"" for NHS staff. They deserve so much better. Ghana increased their hospital staff wages by 50% over the pandemic - why can the UK, one of the richest countries in the world, not do the same.
