Slightly less concerned personally because of vaccination but worried that we are again coming out of lockdown too early. Government has lacked a strategy throughout and I fear that we will return to lockdown in the Autumn if not before. I feel relaxed because I have excellent support and live in a pleasant area with plenty of space. This is not true of the disadvantaged who may still suffer in the future.
I feel particularly frustrated for NHS staff who have been badly treated throughout the pandemic.
