The appalling nature of this gov has become clear, under Johnson & ten years of Tory rule, UK is butchered, & we have not yet seen a terrible conclusion yet. The money handed over to Tories is disgusting, & yet Starmer's Labour seems unable to land a punch. But hey, there are still worse people in Brazil & South Dakota. The biggest danger is the rapidity of the mutations. There is a long list which can be written of the inadequacies of the Tory approach to Covid, which is franly sociopathic. I don't think decent people understand the sociopathic mind, but what has happened is totally understaandable if we eliminate all the possibilities & look at the possibilities remaining.
