I currently feel worried as the death rate and amount of people testing positive is still really quite high in all age groups. However, there is hope with people getting the vaccine but obviously it takes time to roll out the vaccine because everyone is just as important. I do feel that the government could have prioritised a different selection of people. Worldwide the vaccine is needed not just in the UK as this is a global pandemic, so everyone needs to work together. 

In addition, it’s worrying with the vaccine as we can’t be 100% sure of the effects of it until years later down the line.
