The situation in this country has gone on far too long. People do not follow the rules correctly and as such we keep having periods of lockdown followed by gradual easing then we have to go back into lockdown again. There is a strong argument that herd immunity was probably going to be the best way forward and I strongly feel that the issues we still have may well have now all but been resolved. In the area I live in we have been locked down due to the initial tiering system and then the national lockdown for nearly 5 months now and it starting to really get me down. The things I enjoy doing with my family have gone. Holidays abroad, eating out, taking the kids for something fun to do all have gone for now. Yes there is a small glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel and my wife and me have both received our 1st jabs. 3 things I want to happen. Firstly some sort of immunisation passport so we can be free to move within this county and abroad. Secondly just open everything up again, people do not follow the rules so it is pointless keep locking down then easing repeatedly and thirdly keep pressing on full steam ahead with the vacination program. Anyone who chooses not to have it can stay at home and stew as far as I am concerned.
