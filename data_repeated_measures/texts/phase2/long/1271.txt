I feel frustrated that we have been in this position standing still for a year with the outlook in Scotland and harder line taken by the Scottish government less optimistic for the future. We have nothing on the horizon to look forward to and every day is the same. My children have missed out on a year of experiences such as learning to swim, and I have missed  seeing relatives which sadens me greatly. I have anger at the way in which this situation has been allowed to develop and can only hope that vaccines are our way out.
