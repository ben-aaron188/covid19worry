I am very angry at China, illogical though it may be. I am also angry at international response to China, who I feel should be held to account for their practices and response which allowed the spread of Covid to be so swift at the outset. I don’t know exactly what I’m hoping for here, but possibly some international boycott of Chinese products and companies, unlikely through that is when their tendrils are creeping ever more steadily into African economies, and their commandeering of the South China seas continues unchecked.

I am worried about the new strains of the virus, and our ability to manage them. I am particularly concerned about what long term effects may gradually become apparent, both from Covid and from any vaccines (not that this will stop me having one when I get the invitation!). More a sense of resignation about these most of the time, but trepidation and anxiety if I let myself think too much about the myriad possibilities. Stoicism is still helping, though.

Some occasional feelings of optimism, probably more due to the signs of spring and my approaching sabbatical more than positive developments re Covid though, I think. Maybe it’ll be ok - most pandemics seem to have burned out within 2-3 years, after all. But I certainly feel more insular, happier to stay at home, in the UK, and fed up with tales of those travelling around still. I feel pessimistic about the chances of people/countries changing their practices in the future, and angry at the wasted opportunities to get control over climate change/scale down human expansion across the globe. Traffic on the road outside my bedroom window, London’s south circular, is back to even higher volumes than pre-Covid, I think. People are idiots - in the very literal Classical Greek sense :(
