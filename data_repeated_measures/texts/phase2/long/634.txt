I feel like it's only going to get worse and honestly fed up with all of it. The current government are totally out of touch with people and only seem to make things worse for the average person. They are punishing the lower classes whilst making the rich richer. It's almost possible for people now to work their way up to the things we are taught we have to have like a house or having kids. Honestly this Covid thing has just highlighted how out of touch those in power are and how much things need to change. Hopefully in the next 5 years things will get better and our government will actually be there for its people instead of for their own pockets.
