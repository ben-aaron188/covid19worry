I am really fed up with how the government have handled the pandemic compared to other countries I'm really concerned that even in June when everything is due to reopen there will be another spike and we will go back into lockdown. Also due to the fact we are still letting people into the country there will also be variants that the vaccine cannot overcome. I really can't see an end to it, my mum is poorly and can't get the treatment she requires, and to top it all the government insult the NHS by offering a 1% rise which is absolutely disgusting
