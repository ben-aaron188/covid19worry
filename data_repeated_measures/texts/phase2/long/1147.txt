I feel very worried about the future. Especially what the future holds for my children. Their education and what they are missing out on, simple things like swimming lessons. I worry that there are many lockdowns to come even though they say it will be the end in June I really don’t believe it. I don’t want to believe the conspiracy thearists but the longer this goes on the longer I wonder is this all part of a great reset. I am worried about the economy and how we are ever going to recover from this.
