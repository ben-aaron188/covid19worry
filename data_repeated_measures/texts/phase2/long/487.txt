at this moment i am angry at the damage these lockdowns have had to my kids - their wellbeing, their education, their future. We are being subjected to lockdowns to protect the vulnerable - who are now vaccinated and yet we are being told - at least in Scotland that we are not behaving enough to be allowed to eat out or go to a shop until at least May - thats another 2 full months - which means our lives will have been on hold for 14 months by that point. I am angry at how the goalposts for exiting lockdown are being moved - our tier levels in scotland are being altered so that to move down a tier the infection rate per 100,000 has to be much lower than last years tiers. My LA was sitting at an IR last week that under last years tiers would have us in tier 1 but under her revised tiers keeps us in tier 3 which is almost still lockdown. We had 1 infection in our LA last saturday - 1 !!!!! we have been mostly in single figures for the past 2 weeks.
I have felt recently that whats the point in being alive if i cant live my life and government are dictating to me who i can and cannot see , wher i can and cannot go.
We are heading for an overwhelming mental health crisis in this country and we are not equipped to deal with it. The pandemic itself no longer frightens me - our response to it is more frightening at this point
