We have really go along way regarding this pandemic situation. The health and government officials, as well as the masses, have contributed immensely towards minimising the impact of the pandemic.  I am sure things will return to normal soon. 

According to the statistics from health officials, the rate is decreasing rapidly, and with the production of vaccines, everything will progress very fast.

Personally, I do connect with friends and family as much as I can. Sometimes, I do have to go out to exercise since all gym centres are locked. Sometimes, it seems tough, but we are all in it together and with sacrifice will overcome.
