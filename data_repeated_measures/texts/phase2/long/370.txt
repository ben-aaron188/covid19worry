I have come to terms with what lockdown life means and how I have to go about that life. While my life has not been altered as drastically as others due to being a key worker, how I work and what I am able to do at home has changed, not for the better.
I am comfortable living this way as I have become used to it, but I am ready for 'normal life' to resume! I just want to be able tom go and see family without having to work out if one or all of us being there makes it illegal. I want to be able to meet my best mate to have a brew and a chat about life. I can't do these things at the moment and I miss them.
