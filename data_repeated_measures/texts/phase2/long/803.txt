I am just awaiting my turn for the vaccine, slightly cautious of the possible long term effects.

The new variants are obvious signs that the virus is ever changing, but luckily science seems to be one step ahead In battling the virus and giving the country the boost it needs on the long road to a new normality.

I am hopeful that everything should be back to norma by the end of summer with 2022 being a big year in reinvigorating the economy. 

Once the worst of the virus is over it will be interesting to see how normal practices compare to pre covid.
