I am mainly anxious, partly due to the constant to-ing and fro-ing of guidelines and lockdowns. I feel as though I can never become fully settled in my circumstances as I do not know how they quickly and how drastically they will change. I am also anxious about how far in the future I will continue to be affected by the changes to my life due to the pandemic, as I feel it has come at a very formative time in my early adulthood and it scares me that I will never be able to live such important years to the fullest
