I feel it has drained me and more than anything I feel exhausted by it all. I feel happy that there is a road map and schools have returned today but I am anxious about the impact this will have on the R rate. I am also worried that people will start to flout the rules and regs sooner than allowed which will backfire and I fear that this could send us into another lock down once more which I worry would be utterly devastating for society, the economy and people in general. I am sad that a pandemic has caused such hurt and pain and sadness for the world.
