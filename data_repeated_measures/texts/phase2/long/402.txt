I am frustrated that we are still in this situation. I am fed up working from home and having too much time on my own.  Not seeing my work team can be challenging waiting on people to action things. I am annoyed that people still break the government's restrictions which are in place to protect the NHS and keep people safe. However, I am looking forward to being able to see family and friends both in my local area and further afield. Being restricted for so long allows me to value my freedom a lot more.
