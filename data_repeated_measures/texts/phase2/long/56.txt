I am still very wary of the situation but optimistic of the rollout of the vaccine. We cannot afford to be complacent as new strains are still a serious threat but we are moving in the right direction. Even as restrictions are lifted I will still be very cautious and avoid going to shops or work for the foreseeable future. I think working from home is great for me personally and I think it will become more widespread even once we get through this. I think I will still be shopping online, even for groceries for a long time to come. I think we would need to get to a stage where social distancing is not required before I would consider going into a supermarket.
