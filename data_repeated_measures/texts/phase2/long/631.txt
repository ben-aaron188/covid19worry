Fearful about the easing of lockdown in case cases rise and we have to lockdown again.
Still worried that someone I love will get sick but trying to keep the odds in perspective
Hoping that the government stick to their promise of 'data not dates'
Wondering when it will all be over and we can live normal lives again.
Sick of hearing about the vaccine. Will not be having it but wonder how that will affect my freedom.
Angry about the possibility of 'immunity passports'
Worried that masks will become the norm - hate faceless people
