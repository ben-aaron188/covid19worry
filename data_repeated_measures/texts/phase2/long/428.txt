I feel the risk is over exaggerated, there is no real threat, but they keep coming up with new variants to keep us locked in our homes. The consideration of vaccine passports sickens me, this is a level of authoritarianism not seen since second world war Germany. I will not willingly take the vaccine for an illness which has an almost one hundred per cent survival rate. The way people have just accepted their own enslavement makes me weep for humanity. I will continue to live my life without fear as best I can but they are making it increasingly more difficult to be an independent individual with critical thought. I dread to think of the world that all the babies are coming into, they will suffer the most.
