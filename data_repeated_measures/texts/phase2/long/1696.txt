I feel a lot of disgust and anger towards the government for its gross mishandling of the current situation. I fear that people will become complacent too soon with the children returning to schools despite the data showing that schools cause a massive rise in cases. I also feel slightly optimistic that we may be nearing a point where things can become more normal with the mass introduction of the vaccine, though I fear that if the June date isn't stuck to the country will become complacent on any measures.
