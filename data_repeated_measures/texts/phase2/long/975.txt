I'm feeling positive about the vaccine programme and the plan to ease lockdown.
I'm worried about the new variants that pop up and the effectiveness of the vaccine.
I feel something should have been done sooner with regards to travellers entering and exiting the country.
I hope that we have good systems in place and a better track and trace service so we can return to some semblance of normal life.
I am getting married later this year which brings a lot of anxiety about whether the wedding will go ahead as planned.
I have friends who are also getting married so I worry about if their plans will be affected.
