I am hopeful for the future but concerned that in the UK we might snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. I think we need to continue to be more cautious. I am so pleased to have the schools reopened and to have my children see other children again. I am really looking forward to having the chance to see friends and being back in the office again. This has all taken so long and feels like its changed everything. I'm still anxious and worried about my family so I am hoping that by summer I won't feel so anxious.
