I feel worried and anxious. It’s almost a year and the situation is not getting better. My partner and I have been on furlough almost for whole year, which means our income was significantly decreased through last year and we did struggle sometimes with money for food or bills. I am worried when I’ll be back at work and if I’m not gonna be made redundant. I am also worried as my family doesn’t live in the country I live so I also cannot see them and don’t know when I’ll be able to see them. I just hope that the vaccine will help with everything going back to normal.
