I am really worried for the future I’m scared of losing my job and how I will pay my mortgage I’m worried about my health and the health of my loved ones friends and family I don’t think we will ever fully go back to how we used to live I miss going to the theatre and the cinema and meeting up with my friends I have stayed focus on eating healthy and keeping fit by exercising  to improve my mental health and try to stay as active as I possibly can. I’m trying to support my friends who are struggling with isolation and I am currently working from home and would like to continue to work from home post pandemic as I feel this would help with self motivation
