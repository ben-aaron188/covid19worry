I feel optimistic that life will return to ‘normal’ soon. I think that the worst is over and numbers of cases and deaths will continue to fall so that lockdown can be lifted and things can open back up again. I feel that the vaccine program is going well and making a huge difference, and will continue to do so. I don’t feel worried about going shopping and I can’t wait to be able to go without a mask on. I am looking forward to things and I see the light at the end of the tunnel better now, rather than feeling like this pandemic will never be over. I just hope that it al goes to plan.
