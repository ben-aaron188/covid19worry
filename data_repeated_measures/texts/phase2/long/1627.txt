Quite anxious about financial issues but also looking forward to the world going back to normal. I've missed my friends and family and can't wait to click unpause on life. My anxiety has been awful and I don't know how to deal with it really. I have since signed up to the doctors in order to try and get help with these issues. 
I've dropped out of university due to the fact that the online teaching through zoom was not very useful for a masters degree. Along with this, the funding I was getting wasn't enough to live on so now I'm trying my best to find any job whatsoever.
