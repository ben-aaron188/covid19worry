I am a student nurse, so Covid has made my learning all virtual; I cannot learn properly staring at a screen all day. Being on placements on covid wards will be so scary too, and no support from the government is offered. The whole way this has been dealt with is despicable and so poorly organised. I just want life back to normal - I want to see my friends and family, I want to go out, I want to be a typical student, I feel like I've had my teenage years robbed from me so soon and I am sick of being stuck inside all day, staring at a screen and going to sleep to repeat the same thing tomorrow.
