Quite anxious about returning back to work as a teacher. Hard to social distance in school and in contact with hundreds of students everyday. Disappointed with how the government have handled lockdown and the pandemic. I am also so used to life as it is now that I donâ€™t know how easily it will be to adjust and go back to normal life when restrictions are lifted. I feel sad about the situation but also anxious about the future. I have not yet found a permanent teaching role due to less jobs being advertised possibly due to the covid-19 pandemic
