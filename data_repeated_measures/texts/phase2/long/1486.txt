I feel relatively positive about the fact that the vaccines are being rolled out and that the children are able to go back to school. I feel a mild amount of worry that everyone seems to think the schools will end up closing again and also that this could happen due to variants.  In general I feel happy that things are looking like they will soon be starting to get back to normal.  I'm in no rush to travel abroad but would love to have a normal summer being able to see family and travel within the UK.
