ready for lockdown to be over, but ok with the timeline set out.  vaccine rollout going well. very angry at government for their mishandling of this pandemic beforehand though. happy to work from home forever really, i enjoy having no commute and a better work life balance. nhs pay rise is easily do-able, decrease the mp salary. most people not really following lockdown properly to be honest, lots of non mask wearers, people shopping not alone. this pandemic has lasted a lot longer than necessary because people didn't follow the rules
