I'm anxious but hopeful. I am worried about the situation, I worry we will plough ahead out of lock down even if things get worse again. I am worried we will let people in and out of the country bringing in New variants 

 but I am hopeful the vaccine roll out will change things and keep everyone safe. I am pleased this is being done quickly.

I am angry the self employed grant isn't being paid till the end of April when we need it now. I am angry the Tories have no idea how it is to survive on no money
