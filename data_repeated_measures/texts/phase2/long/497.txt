Hope it don’t spread again because of the new strains and we would have to quarantine again.Hope there is no long term side effects from the vaccines. They also need to stop letting people in the country without doing the proper tests,Because when we get a strain that mutates that the vaccine don’t work we will be back to square one. To many people died because things wasn’t done properly and people made the wrong decision or not quick enough. Families broke up a lot people being left on there own especially the elderly. Also A lot of vulnerable people who need help can’t get the help they need.
