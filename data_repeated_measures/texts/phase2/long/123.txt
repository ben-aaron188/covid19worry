I'm glad that the vaccines are being distributed and cases and deaths seem to be dropping. A little frustrated that I probably won't be offered a vaccine until May or June, depending on uptake. Disappointed that a cruise we had booked for the end of May was finally cancelled, although I knew it was inevitable. Frustrated because I've done nothing for the past year, work-wise, but I finally have a few days of work coming up in a few weeks time. A little anxious because it'll be the first time I've gone into London, and thus on the trains, in over a year and I'm worried about being amongst a lot of people in a small carriage. I've managed to avoid catching Covid so far (or at least, to my knowledge anyway) so I don't want to get it so close to being vaccinated. Just waiting for things to return to a semblance of normalcy. Not entirely normal, but a state where I can go out without worrying about the people around me.
