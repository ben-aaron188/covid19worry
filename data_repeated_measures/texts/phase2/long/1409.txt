I feel very optimistic that things are heading in the right direction. COVID cases are falling every day and with the vaccination roll outs the risk is lowered for the most vulnerable. Life will soon be getting back to normal and that is very exciting to think about. There are no longer high deaths every day and hospitals seem to be able to cope better. We are in a much better place than last year and that has lowered my stress and anxiety around the whole pandemic. It seems like we have an end in sight and will soon be able to reunite with our loved ones and get our lives back to how they once were before the pandemic began.
