5 months ago, my father was diagnosed with stomach cancer and started to take Chemotherapy, which destroys his immune system. So, he has become a vulnerable person for Covid. This dramatically changes my perception of Covid and I try to avoid Covid as possible as I can. My hands are irritated y soap and disinfection. There is a sign on my nose because of masks. In addition to this, young people become very sick due to Covid. Because the virus has a new mutation and this one is more dangerous than the old one. I am also worried about my own health. I don't know how can I explain more about my situation. It is like a nightmare. I hope that Covid will vanish soon.
