I feel positive with the situation as we have a vaccine and the r rate is down, especially within my area. I don’t feel positive about the fact that teachers haven’t been vaccinated though as it seems ridiculous that they are going back to work with children all day without being protected against the virus, myself included in this as I work in the education sector. I wish I would be vaccinated sooner but I still have months to wait as I am group 10 and my area is only working through group six at the moment.
