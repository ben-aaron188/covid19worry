Im angry and frustrated that it has taken so long for things to even be thought of as a possibility of returning ""back to normal"". I'm sad  and anxious for my young daughters who are missing out on valuable time with friends family, and missing out on participating in extra curricular groups and activities like ballet, football, playgyms. My daughters are 19 months and 4 years old.

I'm glad that we finally have some ind of light at the end of the tunnel because of the vaccines.

I'm concerned over how my profession will ever recover fully (the arts)

I'm heartbroken for the 3 million excluded who have received no help financially throughout this whole pandemic.
