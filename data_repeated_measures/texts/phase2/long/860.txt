I am a little concerned we are coming out of lockdown too fast. While the goals may have been set at 5-week stages, I cannot understand why some restrictions are being lifted while a good number of people, (namely the age group which is likely to be the most complacent and the spreaders) have not yet been vaccinated. 

And while the vaccine project is going well, I don't feel enough effort is being made by the government to remind those who have had the vaccine to remain cautious. At least until the entire population has been vaccinated at least once!
