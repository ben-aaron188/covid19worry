 my feelings have changed slightly towards the corona virus.
I still feel it's out there but things have changed for the better, I'm still awaiting my vaccine, but the rest of the family have had theirs.
It takes the worry away slightly.
I think people have become more relaxed this lockdown, and it doesnt even feel like a lockdown. Everyone who I know just goes about there business like nothings changed.
I wish everyone would stick to the rules and we could be out of this quicker.
My fear in the future is if a new pandemic appears people wont take it seriously.
