I feel like we are about to get out of this situation as 20 milions of people in uk have been vaccinated. I just got the bloood test result yesterday saying that I have antibodies for the virus as result of the vaccine I had in January and most of my colleagues in healthcare are in the same siatuation which means that the vaccine is working and once we vacccinate more than 50% of the population we can slowly return to normal. However, the government is wasting/stealing billions of pounds on strange contracts with friends that don't come to fruition and then they offer a 1% 'payrise' for NHS staff, which actually is  paycut as the inflation is higher than 2% in the past year
