Ambivalent. Fed up with the to-ing and fro-ing. I wish the governments would just make up their minds and make a choice. Half of Westminster should be resigning in shame and should be in court in front of a judge and jury. Shameful. Let shops open properly so people can get the things they need, what is essential or needed for one person is not necessarily the same as for another. Friends, family and strangers are turning on each other over things that shouldn't make a difference, if someone isn't wearing a mask, just accept it's because they have a reason. None of these 'questions' over it, or insistence on wearing a lanyard. Medical records are private.
