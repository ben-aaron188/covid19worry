I have now had the vaccine, so I feel slightly more hopeful. Although the whole situation is depressing for me, especially as a single person because it has meant I haven't really been able to try meeting someone. It makes me jealous of those who are living with their partners. I am just trying to stay positive and imagine what it will be like later in the year. I haven't been able to travel for such a long time and this has affected my mood greatly.

I was originally scared for my older parents, but they too have had the vaccine and this has made me feel a lot better too.
