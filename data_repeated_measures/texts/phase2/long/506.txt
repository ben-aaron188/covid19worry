I am concerned about the efficacy of the vaccines given the new strains and the impact of children returning to school and the gradual opening up of shops, hospitality etc. I worry that people think it's all over and I dread another wave developing and us being sent back to square one again. I am trying to be cautiously optimistic about the vaccination roll out but anxiety still is the dominating feeling for me. I worry that people are once again going to prioritise wealth over health and this troubles me. I think there is a lot of anger in the world at the moment with people so divided on their views about what is right and wrong in relation to how proceed and this in itself leaves me feeling very uncomfortable.
