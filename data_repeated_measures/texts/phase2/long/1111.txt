I am feeling very anxious about the corona situation. I am feeling very angry and frustrated at people's selfish behaviour and anxiety about the future. As I am vulnerable and cannot be vaccinated at the moment, I'm really scared about the future as I think people will stop caring at all about social distancing and face coverings as soon as they are vaccinated, not considering those of use who are vulnerable but cannot be vaccinated. It is a very scary time and I don't know what the future holds apart from more shielding and isolation and anxiety.
