I'm feeling tired and anxious about the future - job prospects, the economy, and what I will do. I am sad about not having been able to see my family for about a year and a half now, and I haven't seen most of my friends either. I am glad that there are at least vaccines in the world now, but worried about how the whole situation will play out in terms of international borders opening up and countries having access to all the vaccines and treatments they need. I am also a bit worried due to news about new variants popping up quite frequently, and whether the tests and vaccines will be able to keep up with that.
