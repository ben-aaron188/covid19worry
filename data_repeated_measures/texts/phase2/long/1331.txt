I feel like the Corona situation has been going on for far, far too long and it has gotten to the point where it has entirely exhausted me. I no longer find myself entirely missing things I could no longer do during the pandemic, but instead feeling a strong ache of sadness whenever I am reminded of them, such as when I call my friends. I am anxious that the vaccines are not the miracle fix-all that many seem to think they are (despite the fact that they will help the situation considerably) and that many people no longer take the coronavirus seriously and will cause further problems and outbreaks.
