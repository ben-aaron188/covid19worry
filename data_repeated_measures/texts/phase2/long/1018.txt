I am sick and tired of it all. Not being able to go out with friends to pubs n night club. Most days I feel so sad and upset about it all. I am hoping that we will be getting back to some normality very soon. I feel sorry for the ones who have lost their loved ones. Hopefully one day we will wake up and all of this will be a nightmare. I don't trust the government nor the scientist for what they are telling us. The media are constantly feeding us with so many negativities. My mum has recently been getting the vaccination so will my dad very soon. So at least that's some sort of positivity. I can only hope that it'll get better and better.
