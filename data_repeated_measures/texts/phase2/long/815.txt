I'm in the high-risk group so I am very anxious about the corona situation. I feel some relief that a lot of people are now being vaccinated, myself included as I have already had my first dose, the second is due in May. I worry about children returning to schools and college as my youngest will go back to college and she spends a lot of time with me. I want to be optimistic about the lockdown ending in June though I can't help but feel like this may not happen. There are still so many people who don't take this seriously & they are not wearing masks or adhering to social distancing etc.
