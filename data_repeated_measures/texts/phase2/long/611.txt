I'm feeling largely relieved (but that might more reflect the end of a busy and stressful day); and I'm encouraged by the progress of the vaccination programme. However, I'm still concerned that risks persist, and that cases have risen locally during February, and my community has seen its first cases. That means that there is still legitimate cause for concern, and the need for vigilance continues. But after all the disappointments of the autumn and winter, there is at last grounds for believing that something like pre-Covid normality will be possible before the end of June. This is a reason for hope.
