I am feeling confident about the coronavirus situation at the moment. This time last year caused a lot more anxiety as my wife was out of work but now she is working and we are able to get on with life as usual without the economic impact i am feeling quite good. I look at the covid numbers on an almost daily basis and i am finding it comforting seeing the numbers come down. I  think like many people we have found lockdown extremely difficult and we are very ready for lockdown to be fully lifted and for life to go back to normal. we are desperate to get out of the house and go on holiday because being in one place for so long really takes its toll on people.
