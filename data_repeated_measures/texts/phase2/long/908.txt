I feel that this has been a very hard year and the lockdown that took place over the last few months was the hardest of the three because of lockdown fatigue and the cold weather. But now I feel grateful and hopefully because I've had my Covid-19 vaccine and have been lucky enough not to lose any friends or relatives to the virus. I am looking forward to seeing friends and family again but I still feel scared that I could lose my job if the economy doesn't pick up again and I also feel scared that another virus might come along.
