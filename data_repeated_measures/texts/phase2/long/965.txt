I am worried but hopeful that it will all be over and back to normal soon. I am very bored with the restrictions and looking forward to the future. I am worried about money as our income has decreased and we are not eligible for help, so I am very much looking forward to it going back to normal. I miss my family who I haven't seen in over a year. I worry about my son who is 18 months old and has known very little of normality. I worry of long term effects. I am less worried of catching the virus as I am healthy and low risk. I used to worry about my mum catching it but I now dont as it has decreased a lot
