At the moment I am still quite worried about the coronavirus. The government is only now taking measures that should have been done from the very start when the first cases arose in the UK. On top of this, I am developing worries around the reopening of certain sectors of the country. I understand that the hospitality sector has been hit extremely hard over the past year and needs to reopen before a lot of places reach the point of no return. However, my worry comes from the fact that a lot of people are so excited about being able to go on nights out and doing all of these things as groups again that all of them seem to have forgotten the reason that things were closed in the first place. If everyone throws caution to the wind when everything reopens then there is every chance that new variants will arise that wont be as easily dealt with as the previous variations.
