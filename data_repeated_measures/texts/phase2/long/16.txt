i feel worried about catching coronavirus before i get the vaccine. i worry about getting ill and not being able to look after the kids.
i am also worried about new strains and whether the vaccine will be effective against them.
i am looking forward to the schools going back though and things opening again in the next few months. i really hope there isnt another lockdown as this one has been so difficult. i am worried there might be another lockdown in winter as there migh be another strain or cases rise again. i am hoping things will be better in the summer.
