I am hopeful as there appears to be a light at the end of the very long tunnel we have been travelling through. I am looking forward to returning to work and seeing the children in the class! I have found teaching online strange, time consuming and difficult at times. I feel sorry for the children in my class who have missed so much school and we’re just beginning to make progress. It feels like it’s going to be like climbing up a steep hill to get them settled back into school.

I have found this whole situation difficult with not being able to socialise. I am a very sociable person and I am really looking forward to finally seeing my family and friends! Each day that more people are vaccinated my anxiety is replaced with a feeling of hope. I can’t wait for shops and pubs and restaurants to open up. I am also relieved that I won’t have to spend another birthday in lockdown!
