I am just bored of the whole lockdown situation. I want things to be back to normal as soon as possible. I think it's affecting people's mental health a lot and we just need normality back. I want to be able to see my family without worrying about them getting poorly. It's not fair for the kids either. They've not been able to do anything fun for a whole year now and it's sad to see. I just want the vaccine to be rolled out as soon as possible & lockdown restrictions lifted so we can start getting our lives back on track.
