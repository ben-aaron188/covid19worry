I am starting to feel more confident that we will be coming out of these terrible times in the near future. While I am not sure that everything will be back to normal for some time, I am confident that the vaccine will allow a greater degree of normality. My anxiety is starting to reduce and is being replaced by feelings of excitement and happiness. There are so many things that we have all missed over the last year that it is almost overwhelming when you think about what is to come. I am sure that we can cross the finish line and bring some of the benefits that we have seen over the last year with us. Working at home has been a real benefit for me, and I know many others as well. While it will not be positive for everyone, at least having the choice will be a positive thing.
