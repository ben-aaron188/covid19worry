I am very worried about Corona. I tested positive for the virus in January and thought I had cleared it. The effects have come back and I think I suffering from ‘long Covid,’ which is really getting me down and making me feel quite low. I am tired all the time and generally have a low mood. It makes me worried about other people who have it or have had it who have a weaker immune system than me, as I am fairly confident I will get over it but I am worried others might suffer for a long time. I am worried that lockdown is not going to end soon and I will be unable to get back to doing the things I enjoy, which will not help my low mood to pick up and therefore I won’t feel any happier for quite a long time
