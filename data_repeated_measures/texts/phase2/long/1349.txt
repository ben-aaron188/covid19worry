Coronavirus has been really unsettling and dwindling, fear of the unknown and all the uncertainty has been really difficult. It feels like an endless cycle. The insecurity and added fear mongering has also been difficult. Social distancing has made things really cold and cynical. I hope to see a more secure time soon. A lot of people are consumed by the media and publications which I believe adds to the hysteria. Of course justified because many people have tragically died and lost lives, but I feel the way in which it has been handled is somewhat neo authoritarian.
