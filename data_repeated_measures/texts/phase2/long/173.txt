At this current moment in time, I feel anxious. It is the uncertainty that the coronavirus brings. We don't know when things will be back to normal, our children have lost out on so much learning and socialisation. Adults have struggled with less socialisation and mental health issues have undoubtedly risen. I personally have struggled with my mental health, it's a worrying time and we are constantly needing to be aware of social distance, sanitisation and wearing face masks. I feel that I am just waiting on normality to return but at the same time wondering if it will ever return. My life has personally been changed in many ways and I for one know I get quite anxious going out and about because of the length of time I have had to spend inside.
