After one year of coronavirus we learn a lot. People are tired of situation and miss things they used  to do. What I found is as we have coronavirus now I didn't see any people with cold, sneeze and especially running nose. I am after first jab and I feel more safe. The most important thing is listen government and follow the rules because they know what is good. I really feel for the people who didn't see theirs families for that time I mean one year. Shopping nearly come back to normal except the clothes ones. Kids come back to school then it is another lockdown.
