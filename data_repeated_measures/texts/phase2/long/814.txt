The situation has been badly handled, poorly reported on by the media. Itâ€™s tragic how many people have died and unfortunately used as a political football and fodder for poor journalists. Statistics have been misused and abused, and neither government nor opposition care about real people. The vaccination programme is positive and welcomed but too much attention given to those ill informed individuals who are ant-vaxers. The delay in controlling the borders inexcusable and the disregard for the health of non COVID patients unacceptable
