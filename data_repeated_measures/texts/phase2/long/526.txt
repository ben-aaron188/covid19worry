exhausted and fatigued by it all, however starting to feel as if there is light at the end of the tunnel, just wanting to get back to a life without restrictions that we face at present. Weekends at the minute are just the same as weekdays so it doesnt feel like your working towards a break at the end of the working week. Homeschooling whilst juggling my own work has been tiring and then worrying about my and my families health has been another issue which has meant we have no social life at present compared to how our lives used to be.
