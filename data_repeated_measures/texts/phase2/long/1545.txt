I feel utterly drained by it all, to be honest. The pandemic fatigue has definitely hit by this point and I am both anxious and ready to return back to some semblence of normality.  

I’m pretty tired of hearing about it, hearing about people arguing about it and just so sad that as a nation we still don’t really have a handle on it. Hearing daily death tolls for a year is sad and tiring. But feeling a little more positive with the light at the end of the tunnel that is the seeming success of the vaccination program so far.
