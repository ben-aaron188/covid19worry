I feel as though I am experiencing Deja vu. we have been in this exact position before with everything opening up far too quickly, and the persistence of the new variants run a very real risk of rendering the vaccines at least less effective, if not completely useless. I currently have the virus, and although I have been very lucky to only experience mild symptoms I'm so angry that I contracted it in spite of only leaving the house to shop for groceries or to go for a walk by myself in over 3 months. Watching people continue to flout the rules and not get the disease is infuriating while I 'did everything right' and still wound up getting it.
