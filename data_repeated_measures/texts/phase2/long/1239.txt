It has just gone on soo long, I am bored and anxious all of the time. 

I started a small business during the second lockdown because I didn't know what to do with myself and where to put my energy. Whilst in my full time job, the business kept me distracted in the evenings and weekends. As much as I love it, it just something there, and maybe does not bring me joy anymore. Because it's all i've had. 

My partner and I live in a house that even though it's very full it feels empty and like there is nothing to do. 

Overall, covid is boring us now. I HATE that I haven't seen my family in over a year and we are taking it seriously but others we know are not. They are living life all they want, and we have been careful doing our bit.
