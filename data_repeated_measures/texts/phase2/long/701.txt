I feel like my life is on hold, I’m neither happy or sad, just feel like every day is the same and that life just involves existing at the moment. I think the best way to describe it is being in limbo, I still have things to do however motivation is lacking as things don’t seem as real as they normally would. I am hopeful for what is to come though and looking forward for life to return to normal. I know that when things do return to normal I will be excited and will want to make the best of every moment and so I am using this to motivate me to do work and complete tasks whilst that option is not possible so I have more time to enjoy it when it does happen.
