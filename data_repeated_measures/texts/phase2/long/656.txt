I feel a bit indifferent about the coronavirus situation currently. It’s something I feel pretty much used to with it having gone on for so long, but I’m also trying not to get my hopes up with the plans to slowly lift all the restrictions that are currently in place. I’ve not had any relatives or friends suffer with the virus and so it’s not affected me greatly other than having to adapt to a new way of living; which hasn’t been ideal really. But to protect myself and those close to me it is worth it in the long run to be able to see them once again when we are able to.
