I feel anxious about getting back to a more normal life and I feel deeply saddened for all those that have lost family and friends since the start or the pandemic. I do feel angry that people have used the platform of a pandemic for their own agendas - they have been taking advantage of a horrible situation and I feel things like this need to be investigated. Also feel a little excited today as first day of roadmap out of lockdown. I feel let down by social media companies that have allowed so much fake news and vitriol to be spread across their platforms and something desperately needs to be done about it.
