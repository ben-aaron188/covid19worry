I feel like it will continue and after life still won’t be the same. I feel even with the vaccine there needs to be changes. There also needs to be changes in giving false hope that everything will get back to normal soon. I have worry and fear for my elderly grandmother and others around me that they will get sick. I have become fed up with lockdown and news on different channels and it has been draining this second lockdown. I do not like people are deciding to break rules because they don’t care anymore and actually worry about some of my friends and family and helping there mental health
