Anxiously waiting for my mum to be vaccinated. Once she has been vaccinated I will feel relaxed and hopeful for the easing of restrictions in the coming months where I begin meeting up with friends and going to the pub again. My dad was vaccinated last week so I was happy then as it was the first time it felt like it was coming to an end. I am also anxious about catching myself from one of my six housemates as I am currently living in the house share and they are not following the rules very well
