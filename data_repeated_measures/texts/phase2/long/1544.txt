Anxious about the children going back to school as I really want to get out of lockdown soon. I'm hopeful that restrictions will begin to ease soon but I'm worried that cases of Coronavirus will continue to rise again when the children are back at school. I've had Covid as well as the vaccine so I feel I'm quite safe from the virus. It's exciting that people are beginning to get the first doses of vaccine and I can't wait to be able to do things again like go to the pub, eat out in restaurants, maybe go to a festival or go on holidays abroad.
