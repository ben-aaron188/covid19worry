i feel like i have had something huge taken away from me. i feel robbed of the best years of my life. i feel like none of it was my fault and that there was nothing i could have done to prevent it. i feel betrayed by a government that has consistently prioritised approaches that decimate the life chances of young people. i feel angry at the fawning over nhs workers and the elderly and those who fundraise, and this makes me feel guilty. i feel so sad about the huge number of people that have died, but i am mostly embarrassed that the number ever got that high and that by virtue of my nationality, i am implicated. i feel hopeless at the future situation. i feel critical of the vaccine rollout, and don't feel confident because i have learned to question every approach this government has taken.
