I am tired and anxious in general. I am angry and upset that due to the situation I was unable to see my nan and then she died unexpectedly.
I would like to see people and experience life once more but I understand the reasons for not seeing people at the moment. 
I am generally trying to remain healthy, active and positive that hopefully soon life will become a bit more normal and we will have a bit more freedom again.
I am anxious about all children returning to classrooms in one go on the 8th March, I am a teacher and as much as I am looking forward to seeing my whole class again I do have concerns about what will happen if the infection rate goes up again.
