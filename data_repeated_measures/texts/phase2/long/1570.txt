Saddened that this has been going on for a year and measures were not put into place earlier or reduce the number of cases and deaths. Disappointed in the government for making silly rules that people don’t follow because the government haven’t been clear and concise with their rules. annoyed that young people get the blame when the government issues eat out to help out, and then didn’t think any bad repercussions would happen when everyone was allowed to go outside. Bored by the constant messing around by what we can and can’t do at certain points
