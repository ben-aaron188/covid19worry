I am feeling tentatively optimistic due to the vaccine rollout and improving weather but I am concerned about what will happen over the next few months. I just really want to see my family and friends again desperately. I want to be able to take my children on trips and make memories with them as well as seeing my grandparents and enjoying what time I have left with them. I would also like my job to be able to go back to normal now as well as I miss seeing colleagues, struggle not being able to provide care I could before and just want to be there for people again.
