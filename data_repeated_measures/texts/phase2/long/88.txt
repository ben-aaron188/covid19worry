I feel frustrated because there is a lot of mixed information about the Corona situation in the media and among the public such as about the effectiveness of mask wearing, the effectiveness of vaccines and whether the virus is on the retreat.

I feel that the lockdowns to reduce the spread of the virus are having a negative effect on the economy and people's livelihoods without ample evidence that they are necessary.

I think that it will take a long time for society to recover from the pandemic and there could be long term mental health issues that effect people for years to come.
