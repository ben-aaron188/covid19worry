I'm quite stressed about it all. I want it to be over so life can go back to how it was but I don't want to rush back to that state and put more people in danger. It's a delicate balance and it's hard to know what's best for everyone. I miss my friends and my family but I'd rather keep them safe than have them catch the virus and get seriously ill.
I'm also very sad that my university experience has been so disrupted and that I'm missing all of the practical work that was such a large part of why I wanted to go.
