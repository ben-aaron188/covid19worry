I'm really concerned about the outcome of this. Some news says that this situation could keep going for a couple of years, and that scares the hell out of me. I certainly can't keep living like this. I think they're trying to control us more than they already did. I just want to be free. The theory I like the most and the one I hope that is true is that they're trying to force the economy to become online based. My mental health is the worse it has ever been since this happened but also it was thanks to this lockdown that I could focus on my small business and it thrived so I'm grateful for that.
