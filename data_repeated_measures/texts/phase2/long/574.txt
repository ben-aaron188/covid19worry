I feel sad that I can't see my family and that so many people arnt listening to guidelines. It frustrates me that I am doing my best to stay local and stay at home when others arnt. Im desperate to get my vaccine, mainly as I have asthma. I am worried about those that have worked through the pandemic, such as medics and nurses, as I don't know how they will cope once they are allowed to process what they have gone through. And I feel for the families who have lost others because of covid. But I am grateful that I have not been directed effected by covid itself.
