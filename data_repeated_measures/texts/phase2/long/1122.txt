I feel quite content in my knowledge and understanding of covid and how a virus mutates.
I do not feel confident in the governments dealing of this. Far too many mistakes by them. Big organisations, including supermarkets have a pandemic policy in place. It took far too long for this to be implemented.
I’m happy my children are back at school but not happy if they have to isolate for a period of time. My youngest really struggles with the constant changes and not knowing if he is in school or not. Bearing in mind that we haven’t been around germs for a long time my children will catch something which will mean more time out from school.
