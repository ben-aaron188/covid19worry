Bored of lockdown and sad at how much time my 2 young children have lost with friends and family , appalled that we've been in this situation for a year and now in our 3rd lockdown. Amazed and disgusted by how badly the government has dealt with the pandemic, blatently broken the rules and given millions of pounds to their friends with absolutely no repercussions. Sadness at how many people could have been saved. Annoyed at the ignorance of people who don't bother following rules and make this situation drag out even longer while complaining about it at the same time
