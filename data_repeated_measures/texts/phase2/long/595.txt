Less sanguine than I was, feel a little relieved that have had first vaccine, although personally I feel a little depressed generally.
I do not feel this is only due to pandemic situation but also other personal factors.
Life is ""grey"" at the moment with little relief, I do not believe that th lockdown will properly end for a good few months yet and that activities will continue to be constrained by covid rules such as social distancing, hand washing maybe mask wearing, society will not return to pre pandemic state for most people.
