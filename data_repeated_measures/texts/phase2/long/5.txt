I would probably say immense disbelief.I still cant believe that it happened.I am beyond angry how things have been dealt with by the powers that be.Im a little frightened,but less than last year.I am very apprehensive about the vaccine and my mental health is shot.
I am watching the world fall apart,and yet part of me thinks that its actually not that bad of an illness in the majority of us.I think the worse is yet to come. We will be paying both money and mentally for this for years to come. I cant really see a way out.I have absolutely no faith in this government,and little faith in humanity itself.
