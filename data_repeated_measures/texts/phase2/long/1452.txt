Due to current vaccination process in the Uk I feel more at ease as the numbers of people being affected has now decreased. This has allowed schools to slowly reopen and staff to return back to work. I am most looking forward to normality returning to Uk and being able to visit family. This has been the biggest takeaway from the pandemic how lonely one can feel when they are away from their loved ones. However this is not to say you should not take care when you are out and about. There are still several variants of the disease and still a vast number of the population being affected although not in the thousands like December 2020.
