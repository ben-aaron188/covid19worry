I feel worried, I mean university are making us come back to campus which I don't feel is safe, especially since I have to use public transport in order to get there. I am frustrated that people are not following the rules. I also worry how things will be if the projected dates get pushed back, I feel people will not respond well to that at all. I'm frustrated at the fact that if we had had lockdown over Christmas, things would likely be better. I'm also annoyed at how stupid people act in supermarkets
