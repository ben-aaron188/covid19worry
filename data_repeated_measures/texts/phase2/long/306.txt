The vaccination programme is going well and proving to be effective, so it does feel like there is good reason to be hopeful that it will be much more under control before too long; I'm wary of being too optimistic though as all sorts could happen still, e.g.with the variations, and it's impossible to predict; wouldn't have imagined this time last year that it would still be having such an effect now. And even if/when the spreading of it is controlled, the damage it has caused will be felt for a long time so hard to feel much relief.
