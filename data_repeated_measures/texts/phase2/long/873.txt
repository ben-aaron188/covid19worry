My overriding feeling about the situation currently is one of frustration, partially because I feel as though my 'best years' are slipping away from me, as a 19 year old in university, and partially because of the government's handling of the situation. 

I'm lucky enough to have not lost anyone I know directly because of coronavirus, but I have not seen my grandfather in over a year now, despite the fact that he lives approximately a 5 minute walk from my house and usually I would see him weekly.

I have had coronavirus myself, in around October 2020, and I still cannot smell. I didn't suffer too badly with the virus but some of my friends were quite ill. I personally was not particularly scared to contract it because statistically I thought I would be fine, and although I was right I completely understand people's fears about the disease and I sympathise with those who cannot be so nonchalant about it, either for health reasons or financial ones. 

I also have some anxiety about how this may affect my future prospects in terms of leaving university/my career etc. and I also have some economic concerns, coming from a working class family who cannot afford to help me out if needs be.
