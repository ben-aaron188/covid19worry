I feel anger and disappointment at the way the situation has been handled - measures taken too late and not enough and people not taking it seriously and protecting each other and sadness at the effects it has had on everyone, both directly and indirectly, I am also frustrated at how long this has gone on but I also fully understand that we have to be safe but I am starting to feel some hope now vaccines are being distributed quickly and there may actually be a real chance of getting to see people and do things again before the end of the year.
