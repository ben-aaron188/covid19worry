I recently got vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. I am feeling more comfortable at the moment and at ease from experiencing friends and relatives contracting COVID-19 and them only having minor symptoms at worst. The vaccine is giving me some aches and pains and a fever, but otherwise I am fine. However, other people who have had the vaccine have been a little worse off which is quite disturbing.

I believe that this will likely not be the last lockdown we have. I am frustrated at anti-vaxxers and people who do not take the pandemic seriously.
