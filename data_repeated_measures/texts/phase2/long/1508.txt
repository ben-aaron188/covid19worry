I'm feeling slightly hopeful as people, including some of the people I love, have been vaccinated. I'm feeling anxious as I'm worried people will stop taking the virus seriously as infection rates slow which will cause it to go back up again. I find that older people who have already been vaccinated are now less willing to wear masks. I am also sad for a year of my life I missed my family and all life plans are on hold or are no longer possible. We were supposed to buy a house this year but are now on lower incomes and can no longer afford to borrow the necessary amount.
