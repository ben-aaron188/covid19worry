Very worried about current situation, concerned about the health of my family and the risks to my grandparents.
Unsure about future and what will hapen in the next 6 months.
Very difficult living in lockdown and no being able to see family and friends.  Concerned about mental health and aftermath of covid virus.
Feeling very sad and have no desire or energy.  Have only left apartment for food, do not like being in contact with large groups of people.  Wear a mask everywhere I go and clean my hands constantly, am upset when watching news reports on covid
