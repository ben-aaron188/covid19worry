The Corona situation just seems to keep going on and on.  I felt that once we had said goodbye to 2020 then the situation would improve but we are now a quarter of the way into 2021 and nothing has really changed.  I am hopeful for the rest of the year now that the vaccines seem to be working but there is always the fear of another strain being just around the corner and us all going back to square one which I must admit makes me anxious.  Even if everything does go to plan and we get back to some kind of normality by the summer months I am anxious as to what will happen towards the end of the year when the traditional flu season starts.
