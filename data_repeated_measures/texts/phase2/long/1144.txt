I have no real concerns about catching Corona - I am, however, in need of some different space in which to live and work and am feeling ground down by the lockdown. Recognising that I am lucky to be working and have somewhere to live, but both my wife and I have become a little short-tempered recently and I think it is due to living and working at home in stressful jobs without any route for socialisation or catharsis. Zoom fatigue is also a prominent aspect of my life!

I am trepidatious because people seem to want to ""go back to how it was"" but this was not without its problems and however trying the last year has been, there are positive lessons to learn about work, connectivity and community, and I hope these are taken forward.

I have a small level of anxiety about the Corona vaccination because I am extremely scared of needles, but I will not hesitate to get the jab when the opportunity arises.
