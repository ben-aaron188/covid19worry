I feel optimistic and positive about the progress being made in fighting the pandemic and I believe we can now see ""light at the end of the tunnel"". I do not believe we will fully beat the virus for several years, if ever, but I think both as a nation and on a global basis that we will reach a point where outbreaks will be identified rapidly and controlled. Preventative measures, such as the vaccines will be improved. Treatment measures will reduce the severity of the disease for those infected.
