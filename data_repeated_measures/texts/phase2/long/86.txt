I feel promising, as the vaccine should be working and protecting people and things should be opening up again soon and returning to normal.  I'm looking forward to some normality but worried about the virus spreading rapidly again. 

I hope that we are not opening things up too soon and risk having to lockdown again. I'd rather we did it once and properly, and did not rush into things. I therefore feel fearful that we might be rushing into opening things back up again and perhaps we ought to wait a bit longer to ensure the spread of covid does not engulf us again.
