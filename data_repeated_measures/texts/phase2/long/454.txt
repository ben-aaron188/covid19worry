I am frustrated at the restrictions of lockdown and that this is now the third time we have had lockdown. Annoyed that I have had 3 holidays cancelled and my next two are uncertain as the flights may be cancelled.  Im worried about family members espeically those that are older in age. I feel apprensive about the vaccine and unsure if I will take it when the time comes and have been spending time and effort researching to make an informed decision. Both of my Children's education has been negatively affected, my 7 year old has missed almost a year of school only attending the odd few days when  I have been working (in a school) and my eldest daughter has missed lots of her first year of college resulting in her feeling somewhat negative and despondent about her course.
