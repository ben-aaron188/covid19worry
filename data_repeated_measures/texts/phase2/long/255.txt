I am so fed up now i have been home for a year, i have left my home four times all to go doctors or get vacine, I am worried that we will get different strains and just keep getting vaccines over and over, mental health suffering missing family. Dont want to sound pessamistic so looking forwrd to my daughter visiting in garden soon. I am hoping in summer we can have some sort of normality back even if social distincing is still in place. Its good that children going back to schools as they are suffering and care homes can get visitors. But im worried still lets hope this is the last lockdown.
