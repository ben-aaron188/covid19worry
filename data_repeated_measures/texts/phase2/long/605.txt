Nervous about schools opening up next week as there is no social distancing or protection. Nervous in case either I or my children have to isolate because of close cases in schools. Worried about my husband working on Covid wards. Fearful that numbers will rise and pause the reopening of society and push back the planned openings. Frustrated that I canâ€™t do the things I want to or go to the places I would like to go. Shopping online for everything is difficult and not always practical. It also impacts finances while waiting for refunds.
