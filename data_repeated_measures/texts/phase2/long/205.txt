Hopefully the Corona situation is getting under control in the UK.  I have had my first vaccine, as have lots of people I know.  I am looking forward to meeting up with immediate family when the time is right, and taking a staycation in the UK during the Summer.  I think the end is in sight after a very long year when many people have struggled with finances and their mental health.  I will appreciate things more once we get our freedom back and make the most of every day, and make the most of our wonderful country.
