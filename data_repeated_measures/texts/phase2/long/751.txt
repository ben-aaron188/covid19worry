I have found lockdown 3 more difficult than lockdown 1 and 2. i think it's because of the mutations and the discovery that they are more contagious and deadly. It is because of this that I have chosen to stick rigidly to the rules and stay indoors other than to walk the dog. That combined with the winter and dark nights made me feel differently this time round and while I am usually good at boosting myself and keeping myself going it has been more difficult to stay motivated this time. Note - this isn't a depression it's just a slightly lower mood than usual. That said I can see light at the end of the tunnel and I have my first jab on Monday 8th March. All I want to do is stay well until I get my second jab at the end of May and then hopefully I can start to socialise again and get back to a more active and normal way of living.
