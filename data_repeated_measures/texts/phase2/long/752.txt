I am fearful of the restrictions being lifted too soon, just because the politicians want to be popular. Ideally i would want them to remain in place until everyone has been offered their second vaccine dose. I also cant wait to return to normal. So i guess i feel conflicted as well as anxious. I also miss my extended family. I am anxious that my kids have missed so much school that they will find it hard to cope when they go back. I also like working from home and i dont want to lose that facility.
