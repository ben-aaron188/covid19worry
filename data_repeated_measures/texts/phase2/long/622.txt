I feel a bit impatient about getting the vaccine and a little anxious about catching Covid before I get vaccinated.  I've taken my 90 year-old mother for both doses and the first time I was impressed by the organisation but also almost overcome with emotion thinking this could be our way out - I sincerely hope it is.  Although the end of the tunnel is in sight it looks as though the effects on the economy and non-covid health issues will last for years.  The death toll in the UK doesn't look good compared with other countries and you can't help thinking that some poor decisions have been made by the government.
