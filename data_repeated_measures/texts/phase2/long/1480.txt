I still feel very anxious about the situation. It seems in lockdown things improve but as soon as we are not, the problem gets worse again and it feels like there's no end. It is difficult still being separated from people over a year later. People that you rely on when you struggle, or who rely on you but you can't be there for. As a shop worker who lives with someone extremely vulnerable who almost died from covid, going to work is terrifying, there is a constant fear of carrying the illness back home. It never stops being a scary situation.
