My dad passed away 3 weeks ago, got diagnosed with aggressive lymphoma but then caught covid in hospital and that was it. I feel in shock, numb, worried, anxious, depressed. A lot of my family 50 and above had had the vaccine, which is a big relief as i was concerned about them. Now i am concerned for myself keeping safe. I have M.E , exactly what long covid people are suffering and life is very difficult. I want the vaccine but i'm also scared of triggering relapse. Also scared of catching covid. Life feels in the balance right now.
