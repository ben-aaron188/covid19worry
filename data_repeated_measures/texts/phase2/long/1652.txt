It was to be expected. Surprised it  never came sooner. You'd hope now more funding would be there for the medical and sciences but that wont happen unless there is money to be made. Personally it hasn't effected me much, i did lose alot of work but i found other things. Never been worried about catching it. Im asthmatic so i should be buy ive allready lived through bad lung infections and id hope the next would finish me off. There are too many humans on this planet we deserve well most of us everything thats coming unless we come together  put greed aside and work towards a better future.
