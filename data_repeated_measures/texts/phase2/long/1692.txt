I have been very lucky. I am still working - I am a front-line worker so have mostly still been able to support my clients in person. But I am also an introvert and the lack of social events has not been difficult for me. I have enjoyed much of the time to myself to rethink my life and my values.
I do worry about my loved ones but I know they are taking many precautions and looking after themselves to protect against the virus.
I also feel sad for those who have lost their lives and have suffered. And I miss large gatherings in cities, the travel, the cinema, museums and just the general energy of being anonymous in a large world. 
Although I have personally struggled with the changes, I overall feel happy to have survived and I appreciate the perspective that this situation has afforded me.
