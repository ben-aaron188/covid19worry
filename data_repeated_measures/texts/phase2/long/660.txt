I feel very sad about the Corona situation and the impact this has had on society in general. It’s caused a lot of anxiety and stress to so many. This constant lot of lockdowns is very hard on people and devastating in terms of economic and societal measures. I think the impact on education and health care has been significantly worse this time and much more than others. I feel like we really need to be able to see the end in sight and also that things start going well for us all - spring is on it’s way and I hope that it is the end of the Corona situation.
