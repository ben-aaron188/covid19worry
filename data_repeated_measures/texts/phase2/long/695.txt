I feel angry at the government spunking billions on their tory mates for things like track and trace which still doesn't work properly.  The vaccination programme is going well and run by the NHS, so it just pisses me off that they outsource things to mates and it turns out to be shit.  This government has basically stolen our money and given it to their mates.
I feel like restrictions need to be lifted ASAP as venerable are now vaccinated.  CV19 is basically the new common cold, so lets get on with life now.
