Frustrated and sad about the amount of time we have all lost with our friends and family over the last year.  Sad for the children about the number of experiences that have been missed or altered beyond recognition.  Concern that my business may never recover and that demand won't increase. Worry over the vaccine and what effects it may have on national health. Worry about how life will look in the future - anger at the suggestion of vaccine passports and how trapping that feels. Concern for the economy and housing market in particular.
