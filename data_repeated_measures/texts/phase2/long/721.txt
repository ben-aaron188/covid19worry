 I feel like lock down has made me very anxious person. I get stressed out very easily and itâ€™s showing on my skin. I also miss going to work and seeing my co workers. I feel distant from my friends and family. I do not go out for grocery shopping as often as I used to and I am also not very active. I think I have gained few pounds. I also feel  like I am not very close to my co workers. I tend to work more hours and take very few work breaks. I also find that work is getting more hectic and work load is more than before.
