Whilst I'm relieved that I've had the first vaccine, I'm still very worried that it will be some months or even years before 'normality' returns. I'm wondering if there will be a much worse third wave from some of the virus mutations, given that some who have yet to have the vaccine appear to be suffering from 'lockdown fatigue', and are now selfishly carrying on as if there is no danger. I see many people on a daily basis not wearing face coverings, and the roads seem to be as busy as they were pre-lockdown.
