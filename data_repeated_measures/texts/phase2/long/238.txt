I am in a quandary really. I feel very nervous about things reopening. I think that we have all become so used to being at home, that it is strange to think of the world properly reopening. There are still times when i can't believe that this has happened.I also hope that they vaccines are truly effective. But i am also happy to think that we are getting this thing under control, that life might go back to a certain level of normality and that i can see my friends, my family and do my passions again, without fear.
