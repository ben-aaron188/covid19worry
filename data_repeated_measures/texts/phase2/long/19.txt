I am really fed up with the social isolation and how long this has been going on for. I don't really think we'll all be free in June like Boris says, they always come up with a new agenda to stop people having their freedom. 

This stupid virus has taking over enough peoples lives, it's time for normality to return. After all how long can the Government realistically keep paying peoples wages. The country will be bankrupt soon.

Kids are also being cheated out of a good education as they're never at school anymore.
