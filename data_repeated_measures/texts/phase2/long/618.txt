I am hopefull that we have got through the worst of the crisis and that we will be able to live a more normal life in the coming months. The most vulnerable in society have been or are being vaccinated. Personally whilst I don't know when I will be able to be vaccinated I am fairly comfortable continuing with social distancing until that has happened. So I guess I'm feeling hopeful and relaxed at this stage. Until it is almost completley removed as threat I am going to be slightly anxious about my own health as I know even if it doesn't kill you the health effects can be very bad.
