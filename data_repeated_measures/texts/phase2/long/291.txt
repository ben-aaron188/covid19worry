I'm glad that things are improving. I am a bit anxious that I have not had a vaccine yet, and that something bad could still happen and I could get it before the vaccine comes. I am glad that my children are now able to go back to school though. They will have to take tests twice a week, which is also a bit stressful. I am worried that they may end up having to come home an isolate if a friend tests positive, or if they do. They are so excited to go back to school that it would be a real shame if that had to happen.
