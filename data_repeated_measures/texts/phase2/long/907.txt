I am prepared to live with corona as long as we all get our vaccines. The government has handled this terribly and the blame on young people at university especially is disgusting. I just want to see my friends and family without fear of being reported etc but I also understand the importance of distancing for safety. It’s all very frustrating, I got a partner during this pandemic and although it’s going really well, we haven’t had a sleepover or some normal things couples would do because we literally can’t and that’s weird.
