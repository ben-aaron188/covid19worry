I am currently awaiting being called for my vaccine for which I am very grateful which for my age group should be in the next few weeks.  I miss my family and look forward to being  able to see them again and to be able to hug my son and daughter.  I feel hopeful that this is something I will be able to do this year.  I don't feel as anxious about the situation as I once did but only being able to only go in my local area for walks is getting very monotonous, I can't wait to be able to go on trips away again.  I look forward to happier and more normal times.
