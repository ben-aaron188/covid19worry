I am annoyed at how the government has handled the situation. I am annoyed that they blame the public for not following guidelines despite it being the government's fault that the guidelines keep changing. Sending children back to school before September is too soon; they should have let them stay home until then so the effects of the vaccination can regulate into the population. Hundreds of thousands of people have died at the hands of the government, and I don't understand how the government came to make these decisions only to back track them weeks later because of repercussions. I also do not think it's fair that the NHS staff are only getting a pay rise of 1%, it is absolutely ridiculous, especially after the past year.
