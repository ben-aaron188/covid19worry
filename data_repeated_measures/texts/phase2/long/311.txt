For me, Covid has shown me how not unified people are. It is shocking to see that at least 1/3 of the people I interact with (due to my job) dont believe in Covid and dont do anything to prevent themselves and/or other to catch it or transmit it. This is extremely annoying for me and due to that I very often feel moody and angry throughout my day. At the same time, knowing that my family is in a different country makes me less worried about them and how my job can affect their health; however the fact that I have managed to send a whole year not (knowingly/ tested)tested positive for covid and I have followed all necessary rules in order to do so, makes me extremely angry to see people responding so carelessly about it and being the reason why we are heading back to normality so slowly.
