The corona virus is a frustratingly over manipulated situation used to cover up other situations, assert control and breed fear amongst us all. I do not fear the virus I fear the people that 'created' it and have anger and resentment to all those involved for putting us all into such a dire situation - mentally, emotionally and financially.

We will overcome this and the truth will eventually come out the m ore people realise that MSM, those in power and many others are behind all of this. I don't deny there is an actual virus but I refuse to believe in the plandemic. There are too many inconsistencies and nothing adds up.
