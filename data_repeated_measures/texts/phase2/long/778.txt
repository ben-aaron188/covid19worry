I am feeling happy and positive about my three children going back to school and life returning to more normal and coming out of lockdown. I am also going for my vaccine later this morning. The news seems to be more positive in the last few weeks about cases and deaths falling to lower numbers so that is a good sign. I am a little anxious about my children settling back into school and having to have the lateral flow tests (my two older secondary school children). I have got a new job online tutoring so am happy to work from home for longer now.
