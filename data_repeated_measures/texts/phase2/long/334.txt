sad and weary,all that death and misery that is extra to all the nor
mal death and sadness....
It  seems endless and to have been going on for years ,not just one year...but my life is total lockdown,always has been so when rest get over it I and few others will be left behind as always,noone caring
worried too that there will be less and less help for those that  need it ,particularly if tories continue to reign,which is likely,all humans being selfish...
will there be enough jobs for the young,must have seemed forever this period for youngsters,very sorry for them...
