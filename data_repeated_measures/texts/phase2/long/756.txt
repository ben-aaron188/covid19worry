it is not over yet we all need to continue to stick to the rules. I feel that a lot of people are acting as if lock down is over and this will not help. I am frustrated by the number of people going shopping unnecessarily when we should only be going out for essential shopping. I also feel annoyed at those who are calling for places to open up quicker than planned as we need to re open slowly so there is no sudden surge in cases. We all want to return to normal but we need to do so slowly and carefully.
