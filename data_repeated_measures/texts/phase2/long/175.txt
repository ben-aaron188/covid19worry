I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and deaths seem to be done, so the economic impact and long term social and health impacts that has is becoming more important to me. Travel appears to be opening up earlier for vaccinated people, and in my country that means the elderly and ill, and there are also reports that the elderly are breaking lockdown more once they are vaccinated. This really angers me as the working age population and young people have suffered so much to protect the elderly and now they break the very rules we put in place to protect them. I am very worried about the long term tax burden working age people will face to repay the money the government has borrowed. The older generation already control most of the capital, and the young were already in an increasingly bad situation and it seems like this trend will continue and even accelerate.
