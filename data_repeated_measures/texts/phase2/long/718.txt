As sad as it is and the fact that many people have lost their lives, I am grateful for the extra time I am getting with my family currently. I am grateful for having to be so close to them and learn how to resolve conflicts with them. I am sad about everyone that has lost a loved one to Corona but I am grateful and blessed that my family has not greatly been affected by this disease. I feel blessed that no one in my family has been greatly ill by this disease and that we are all still healthy and we have managed to keep our jobs and have some income coming in.
