I'm feeling like there is so much light at the end of the tunnel and we are coming to the end of the last year being so dark. There has been alot for me to take in and adapt to the changes imposed upon me. I have just been lucky I still have my job and I have been working throughout the pandemic and been able to save some extra money in the process. This time has made me think about what I want out of life and how I want to live it once restrictions are lifted. First thing is first is a new sofa...
