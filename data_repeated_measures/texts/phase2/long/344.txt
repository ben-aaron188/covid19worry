I feel like there is a little hope for the future with the roll out of the vaccine, but the government has mishandled the pandemic at every turn and caused so many people's needless deaths. I feel anger because money has been wasted and given to Tory cronies instead of spent on things that will actually help people. My husband has lost his job so we are worried about making ends meet. It's a very stressful time because there is still a lot of uncertainty. I am also worried about the new virus variants as, although it seems hope is on the horizon, they may ruin things once again. I am tired of not being able to see my family, especially my 1 year old nephew as I feel that I am missing seeing him grow up.
