I have mixed feeling at the moment, all is so uncertain here in the U.K. as well as in the rest of world.
The kids are about to come back to school and I get worried about my husband - who was declared ‘key worker’ since he works for the government at the begin of the pandemic. He’s been going to the office all this time and kept safe especially on public transport. Is that social distancing will be kept? I’m not sure -  people are being shortsighted, they think that cause they took the vaccine is back to normal life in a flick of a switch and they are not respecting social distancing or even wearing masks anymore. People are already breaking rules after rules, and that makes life harder on people that can’t work from home and needs to use public transport.  
At the end of the day,  I just want myself and my family and friends to be kept safe, as selfish as that statement might be.
