I currently believe that the Corona situation is being brought under control. 
The governments roll out of the vaccine has proved to be very successful and is helping to bring down the rate of infection and the number of deaths. I think if this continues we will soon be able to resume a more normal lifestyle.
Provided there are no more outbreaks of new strains, or strains that are not controlled by the vaccine we should be able to return to a more normal way of living with shops, pubs, restaurants etc able to re-open.
