It seems to have become normal now in many ways. I am lucky I have a job that keeps me in a positive routine. I feel tired by it all and I miss my family as I am alone in London. I do also have a deeper sense of gratitude for everything I do have because of the pandemic. I also feel that as an introvert the lockdown has made me feel safer anyway although I wish the reasons for needing it were not so harmful with loss of life. I think it has made everyone slow down and think. I think that a lot about the way we lived before will not easily or ever go back to how it was. In some ways this is relieving to me and in others is something I just can't comprehend.
