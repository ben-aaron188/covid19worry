I currently feel hopeful that we may be coming to the end of corona ruling our everyday lives. However I am anxious that we will once again have another surge and be plunged back into another lockdown. I am concerned that if we are placed into another lockdown the country will not recover economically, mentally or physically. As humans we are not designed to spend almost 12 months in isolation and confinement. I feel the whole population is desperate for interaction with friends and family and some form of normal life. I am trying to remain hopeful that we really are coming out the other end by looking at the falling numbers regularly and reassuring myself that the plan to come out of lockdown is well thought through and thorough.
