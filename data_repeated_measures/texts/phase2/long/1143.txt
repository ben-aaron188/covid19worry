I feel that there is hope for the future now, but I have an underlying condition and still haven’t been vaccinated, so I still have some anxiety at catching COVID. I’m glad that my parents are feeling happier and more positive, but do worry about bee variants reopening the can of worms and the extreme ideologies that are being fuelled by the economic uncertainty this is causing. Coming at the same time as Brexit a lot of people are going to be significantly poorer and in times of strife extremism can breed.
