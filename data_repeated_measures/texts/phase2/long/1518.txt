It's been like living in Groundhog Day, but without there being any sense of personal development and moving forward. Sure, I've been able to develop some new skills, such as copywriting, or doing more on the tech side of the business, but it's been a year of endless loss. And although there are promises of lifting restrictions, I'm deeply cynical about how much will actually be lifted. Three weeks to 'flatten the curve' turned into months, then back into more lockdown; 'the vaccine will turn things around', except that actually, the vaccine hasn't changed anything, and won't change anything. Not when everyone is willing to see business destroyed, livelihoods ruined, and the police moving forward to totalitarianism.
