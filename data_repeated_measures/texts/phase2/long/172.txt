I am massively disappointed in our government, and a certain element of society who have been very selfish in regards to peoples lives and wellbeing. If the government had acted with people interests at heart, and not money, this would have been a very different time, with many lives saved. This has left me feeling sad, and anxious about the who situation right now. However, there has been a large part of society which has amazing and cheered me greatly, showing generosity, heart and kindness in supporting others, and working together to reduce the spread of the virus.
