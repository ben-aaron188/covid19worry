Im feeling more optimistic now as the vaccine is being rolled out. Life will start getting back to normal and that is something Im looking forward. I like the road plan outlined by Boris Johnson few weeks ago
Also the deaths are falling pretty fast and so are case number which is giving me confidence and the people around the country
Every day Im seeing more cars and people out and about and I like that as confidence is building
Also as shops start to open up Im pretty sire I will be the first to go in
