I feel frustration at my current political system here in the UK of the handling of COVID, as I feel our numbers are way too high even now, and with the new variants seeming to come into the UK like it's nothing, I'm angered and anxious about the state of the UK and possible new waves. I don't really go out to try and protect myself as best I can, I feel isolated and longing to start my therapy again to get out and about and travel, but I can't do that with COVID in my area. I live in scotland, and I feel scotland handled COVID better than england, however we're still their doormat, and english people are still allowed into scotland to spread the results of their poor policies everywhere. It's really not fair, and I wish we could just close our borders solidly until it's really gone from england and scotland.
