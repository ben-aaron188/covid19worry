Compared to how I felt last year I feel hopeful that scientists and medical personnel have a better understanding and control over Covid. Vaccinations are going well in this country and I'm certain this year will be better than last year. Things are hopefully on the up now and we can start recovering and, although already a cliche, finding a new normal. I am disheartened, however, by all the bad press and feelings by some about the different vaccinations and hope that soon dies out when the figures prove their effectiveness.
