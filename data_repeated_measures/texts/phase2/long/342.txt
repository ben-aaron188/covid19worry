Not so much worried anymore just a bit fed up. Working from home is okay but I want to see my family and friends again. I also lost my grandad to coronavirus so that hit us all really hard. We’ve had holidays cancelled, some people have lots jobs and can’t afford to live. Everything is just making me feel a bit fed up now. Hopefully things will go back to normal in June and we can start moving forward and getting back to the way it was. Even though it’ll never fully be like it used to. I think wearing masks to go shopping will probably be mandatory forever now
