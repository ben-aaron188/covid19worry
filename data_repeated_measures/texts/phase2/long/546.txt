I feel a little bit more hopeful due to the vaccine but also hopeless because I miss my elderly grandparents and my old life. I also feel guilty sort of a survivor's guilt because so many have lost their lives. I am quite anxious for my vaccine and understand the order of priority but am worried incase I get covid beforehand. This past year has been one I cant wait to forget but I feel I may suffer longterm effects such as anxiety and depression. I am also fearful of going out too much. Realistically I just want things to go back to normal whatever the new normal will look like.
