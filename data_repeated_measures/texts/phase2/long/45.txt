Anxious. More so about lockdown than catching covid. Will things go back to normal following the vaccine or will the rules be relaxed only to see us return back in lockdown in a few months time back to where we are currently? It's very worrying as I don't think many would go for a third lockdown, especially with people's mental health suffering as it is at the minute. My child has just been able to attend nursery and if we were to go back in to another lockdown and he's not able to attend, then their mental health may also end up suffering more with things just getting back to normal finally.
