My dad passed away from covid the other day and I currently have covid too. I feel anger, upset, frustration and anxiety. Covid has robbed me of a father, my mother of a husband, my partner from a future father in law and my family of a brother, uncle and brother in law. I feel anger that people are not taking it seriously and that some people feel that it does not exist. They should feel thankful that they have not been affected by this pandemic. I'm glad that there is now a vaccine. I have been able to have this due to work, therefore my symptoms are currently not too bad.
