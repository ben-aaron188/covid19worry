I'm fed up of it honestly. It's affecting my and my sons mental health (although thankfully he is now back at school which greatly helps). My employer is not handling the situation as well as I would hope and we are considered essential so have to be at our place of work as well, and are unable to work from home. Often it is impossible to fully socially distance there and we've all but been told that they've ""done everything they can"" so if we catch corona it's our own fault which is just ridiculous as the place is a nightmare. I just want some normality back and to be able to live my life without this constant stress, worry and anxiety.
