I feel like the messages are very mixed and I have to teach in a class of 34 children but cannot meet my mum. It is getting a bit ridiculous now and I'm fed up. I think the order of things opening is incorrect. Schools should not be opened before outdoor leisure facilities. I also think we should be able to have one bubble to mix with as I'm very very lonely. My mum is my childcare bubble so I can see her everyday but not go in her house. It just doesn't make sense. I do think that some other outdoor areas should now be opened- everyone is just crowding into the limited parks and playgrounds instead.
