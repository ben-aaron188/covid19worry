At this moment, I am pretty relaxed because it feels like a lot of things are going well (vaccines, lockdown relaxation etc.). I am looking forward to the rest of the year and hopefully eventually being able to go on a holiday once this is all finished. This will probably require me getting a vaccine so slightly nervous about when I will be able to get this and whether there will be a chance to get this before Summer ends due to my age range. Looking forward to returning to the workplace from time to time as well as I haven't had a chance to meet my new colleagues at work
