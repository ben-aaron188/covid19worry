I am feeling positive that the country has turned a corner in the fight against covid. I believe the vaccine programme is a success and will make a huge difference. I do still feel anxious that a third wave might come in winter, but for now I feel hopeful and am looking forward to getting my life back. I very much hope that businesses can bounce back once restrictions are lifted, and I want to believe that the summer will be positive. I am worried though that I might be being too optimistic, and that new variants might mean that we Go back to square one and need more lockdowns. However I donâ€™t think I can dwell on this too much- I need to focus on positives to get through the next few months
