I am sick and tired of it all. I live in fear most of the time and being stuck indoors is really hard and getting harder. I miss my friends and family so much. I miss normal life. It feels like it will never end. I feel like my mental health has suffered greatly and I already had a mental illness. I don't know how I will ever adapt to normal life even when we can have it. I feel like the whole situation has been handled disgustingly by the government and its really shown me people's true colours. It has wrecked so many people's lives in a multitude of ways and it feels like there is little hope for the future
