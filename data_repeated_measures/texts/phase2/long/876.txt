I am less worried about it than I was because I have been vaccinated and so have my elderly parents.  I still get anxious if I am on a bus and someone near me is not wearing a mask.  I also feel anger towards people breaking the rules.  I feel like we are coming to the end of the really bad Corona times but maybe I'm wrong.  I am still lonely and not able to see friends or my boyfriend in lockdown.  I feel fear if I think about other new pandemics happening in the future and anxious about governments not preparing for this now
