I feel very conflicted right now. I am hopeful for the future and about to have my vaccine and can see some things returning to normal. But I am also angry about how the UK handled this as we have some of the worst death rates in the world and the money wasted on things that were meant to help us but went to the friends of politicians. I am also realistic and I follow a lot of scientists on this and know that the vaccine is unlikely to be the end of the pandemic as most 3rd world countries will have to wait years for it and there will be those who refuse it. Plus the virus will mutate and the vaccine gives evolutionary pressure yet we aren't looking at permanent vaccination centres or how we would deal with this. I have been shielding for nearly a year now and want to feel safe but I feel most people my age just want to go back to the pub. I also feel that disabled people have been largely forgotten. I have severe asthma that doesn't count for group 6 with the vaccine but I am too fat and getting it for that reason. I think obese people should have the vaccine as we are at risk but I am sad that thin people who have asthma as bad as mine and are young have to wait
