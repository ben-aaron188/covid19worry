I don't feel that the Government has handled the Corona virus pandemic very well, and this makes me angry. We came out of the first Lockdown (LD) too soon, and the second one, as well. The Government should have had ""the balls"" to be much firmer than they were in handling the situation. The government should have taken more notice of Science than they appeared to. Boris in all of his briefings certainly never seems to understand what he's talking about.
However, now we've started to vaccinate, I do feel optimistic about the future and hopefully there will be no further LDs. We need to make sure that as many people take the vaccine, because vaccination is an important way forward.
