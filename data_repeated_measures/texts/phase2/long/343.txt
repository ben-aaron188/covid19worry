I feel tired and exhausted by the Coronavirus situation. I feel like my life is on hold and has no value right now. I haven't seen friends or family in person for over a year now, as they live several hours away. I can't remember the last time I did anything of interest or felt 'alive' - it must be at least six months ago. I live alone in a small apartment with no garden or green space. I spend most of my life here. I feel like I am merely existing. I am physically and mentally in the worst shape of my life. I need normality back and I need something to look forward to.
