I feel a bit bored, like everybody. I'm lucky to have a job where I know I'm safe to go back. I feel quite relaxed about things generally, although there's bound to be an economic hit down the line for the country. I don't know anyone who has been affected with coronavirus so in that sense it might not have hit home as much for me as it has for others. I have also not had to see how this can affect hospitals etc. I can see why some people feel as if it's exaggerrated, but then I epxect they wouldn't think that if it was affecting them as it has others.
