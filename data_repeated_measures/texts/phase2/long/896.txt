Corona situation fearfully kids are back next week they could bring it home then spreed around the house  and i still have a shielding child at home scary that they could catch it , worried that my other half will catch it for a 3rd time in work at the hospital and worried that they have now found another new strain in the uk that it is going to spread again and the jabs will not work against the new one , hateful  being stuck in all the time bored of it all wish it was over now and hopeful  get back to normal
