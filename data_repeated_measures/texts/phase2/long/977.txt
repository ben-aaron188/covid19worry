During the current Lockdown in England I have felt more isolated than before. Prospects seem bleak at the moment and with such cold weather its not easy to get outside for a walk. I work in the healthcare industry, I feel emotionally battered from all that I have seen over the last year. The government appear to finally have an idea of what to do with vaccines but this seemed for quite a while like they didn't have a sound plan. Many of my personal relationships have soured over the last year as so many people I know are feeling their mental health has been affected by lockdowns, loss of jobs etc.
