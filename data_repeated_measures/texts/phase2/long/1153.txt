I am upset because my children have suffered a lot in the 3rd lockdown. Even though they are back at school it has taken them a lot to settle in. 
My eldest is very sensitive and has started wetting the bed again. 
My youngest is being very naughty and is refusing to go to school and has to be dragged in kicking and screaming. 
This is very upsetting for me because I don't know how to help them. 
I am annoyed that the vaccines were given to the old people first. They should have been given to those of us who are of working age. We are the ones who have to risk ourselves every time we go out to earn money. The old people are still hiding indoors even though they are vaccinated.
