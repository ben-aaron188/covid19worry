In short, I feel overwhelming frustration. The UK government seriously mishandled the situation and sacrificed human lives to ""save"" the economy. However this plan failed and what actually happened is that we have a significant death rate, plummeting economy (with more austerity to come) and insulting claps for the people who kept this country going (and a 1% payrise as the rest of the money was spent lining the pockets of the likes of Dido Harding).
In terms of the actual virus, I feel sadness at the death and sadness at how the entire population's life has stood still in the last year. It all feels out of our control. Even with the vaccinations up and running, the new strains are popping up and I just dno't see an end to this. I suspect that there will reach a point where we start up our lives again, opst-lockdown, and accept coronavirus to be part of our lives in the same way the flu is.
