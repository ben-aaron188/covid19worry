We’re approaching a year - and yet I still feel a range of emotions daily, almost as if I’m still trying to come to terms with the enormity of it all. 
I’m extremely analytical of science, data etc so whilst I can rationalise modelling, mutations etc ifs hard to balance that with how I feel. I feel guilty for still having what I deep down know are guilty individualistic desires when there are so many pressing public health pressures. I feel sadness that I haven’t been able to develop a relationship (especially physical) - yet happy that as a single mother I’ve gained such golden bonus time with my 9yo (albeit under the most strained of circumstances); it felt like the early baby days just us two all over again. 
I feel disgust/contempt for the woefully inept handling by the government, which has cost thousands of lives. 
And yet there’s a weird sense of calm - the pandemic is happening, I can’t change that, what I can do is find moments to reach for breathe from it all. 
I’m just grateful to feel, I glad I’m not numb.
