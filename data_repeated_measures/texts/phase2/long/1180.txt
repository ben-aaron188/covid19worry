I spend too much time worrying so much about life in general, let alone since COVID-19 came to light. 

Sometimes, I worry so much I feel as though I’m going to have a panic attack and it’s terrifying. I am constantly thinking about “what ifs” and they usually involve situations such as me losing a family member or my daughter growing up without me. Even just typing this I feel sick to my stomach. I know there’s not much I can do about the future but it is constantly on my mind; how to prevent things from happening but there’s only so much we can do, I know that but it’s still scary.
