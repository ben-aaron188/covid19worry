had enough of it all now, we need to feel how we did before it all started. Kids doing back to school without anxiety, their work not suffering, Our usual activities need to be resumed and we need to be reunited wit our relatives and friends. When all this returns we can start to adapt back. This will take a while in itself as it has been so long and we have fallen out of our routines. This causes anxiety in itself. At this moment I want to be back to normal but fear how easy or difficult it will be.
