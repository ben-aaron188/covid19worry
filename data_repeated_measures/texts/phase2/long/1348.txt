I’m a final year university student so I have been doing online learning since March 2020, as a result I don’t feel like I’m getting enough support from my supervisors as I would of Coronavirus wasn’t around. 

I do like lockdown because i’ve got more time to do things but at the same time it feels like i’ve got no excuse to do things because I’m at home all the time. I’m currently experiencing major burn out but I don’t have time to rest.

I do feel sad but i can’t imagine life ever going back to normal and i fear that if we come out of lockdown early April like Boris plans in the UK then we’ll just be back in lockdown again for the summer.
