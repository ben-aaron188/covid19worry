I feel a constant low-level anxiety about the situation, and how quickly it can change. Mainly I feel fatigued; missing my family and wanting to normal things (visit friends who have had babies/become engaged during lockdown; go to the pub). I feel great sympathy for people who have lost loved ones, or their jobs. 

The progress of the vaccine roll-out gives me some hope, but it feels like every day there is a new story about variants, or people not wanting to take the vaccine, and it feels that the situation won't end. I worry mainly about my parents' health.
