I am feeling quite optimistic, I feel that some people are still being silly about the situation but with the vaccine I am hopeful of a return to normality soon and to have a map out of lockdown is very hopeful. But I am still anxious As at the moment there is the Brazilian variant which sounds like it might come around soon and I hope the vaccine is effective against that too. Really there will be anxiety for a while as currently there is always a chance of a mutation happening that will be worse.
