I feel much better than I did a few months ago, as most of the at risk population have now been vaccinnated. The outlook is looking much better that things will be able to hopefully return to normal. I'm looking forward to being able to see family and friends as well as hopefully going on holiday again. 
I'm also feeling grateful at how well the vaccine programme has been rolled out within the uk. However I'm still very angry at how the governement has handled the situation and how we come to have so many deaths.
