I feel like the fight is not over, and frustrated that people can’t tow the line. I’m so sad that I’ve been so disconnected from all my family and friends for such a long time. I wish that from the start boris had tied his shoe laces properly and just shut us down.
I think if measures had been stricter in the first place we wouldn’t of all had such a horrific winter. 
However I am very grateful to have had 2 does of the vacation now and that the roll out is going so well.
I think that asking for 500 characters is stressful and hard to think and write when iso poor at English and though after another day of home schooling.
