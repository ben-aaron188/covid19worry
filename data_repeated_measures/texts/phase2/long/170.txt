I feel about Corona situation slightly worried at this very moment. I also feel anxious in regards incomplete information and statistics. I feel at his moment that I very much want to hope for the best and we can back to normal but I do not feel that this is realistic in the near future. Because of that I also feel a bit of sadness that our future life will change permanently and I don't know if this is for the best or worst. I feel upset that I can't have my previous life style right now and  I don't know when it will back. I feel also upset that I can't see my friends and spend time with them.
