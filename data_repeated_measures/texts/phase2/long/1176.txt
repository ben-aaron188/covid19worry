I'm feeling really bored and fed up. I'm glad the vaccination project is going well and the number of infections is going down, but I can't find solace in this, my financial worries and slim chances of travelling abroad soon to see my family make it difficult for me to be happy. I struggle with getting energy to do anything and it wouldn't surprise me if this was an onset of depression. At least the days are getting longer and there is more natural light and less greyness. At least something. | really hope that spring will not see another spike in infections. I don't think I would be able to cope well if there was another lockdown coming.
