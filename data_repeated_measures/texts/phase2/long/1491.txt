Sad about the economy and lives the lock down has effected. Sad about the lives lost. I also feel fortunate to have a job, thankful for my family and a home. Because nurseries are open I have my sanity. I feel sad that as an Australian expat, my family hasn’t meet my 14 month old daughter and no idea when they will. I feel anxious about the vaccine shortage as I’m yet to get one. But I’m thankful my husband, who is a teacher, has had his. Mostly I feel like we’re all just waiting for life to restart. Things are nice and calm and our world is small but we know there’s so much more and we miss it
