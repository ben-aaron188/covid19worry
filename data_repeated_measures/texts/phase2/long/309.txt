I feel very apprehensive, last year I was told to shield, my husband to shield with me. The figures were very low.
This year my husband has to work, the figures are high and him and I worry we are at way more risk. The support for shielding people is not taking into account partners.
Until he is vaccinated we are going to be vulnerable. I have been in a full 13 months next week and it seems that the government are not really protecting people like me who have other people in the house having to work.
I feel sad as I have not seen my children or grandchildren to hug for over a year.
