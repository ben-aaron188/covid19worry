Not convinced this will be our last lockdown restrictions not even lifted and people are making plans  to do things that are currently restricted do feel like it is a gradual lifting of restrictions feels unfair to the younger people who won’t receive vaccinations until nearer the end of roll out. Worried that we will need to lockdown again would rather stay restricted now for longer than do another lockdown later. Think a lot of people will go overboard once restrictions are lifted. Worried about the kids catching up with school work don’t think some of the suggestions will work for a lot of families
