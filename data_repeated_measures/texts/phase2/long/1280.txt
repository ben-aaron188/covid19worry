COVID 19 is clearly a killer but in my opinion, only a certain section of society has life threatened by it and some measures being taken are going overboard.  Vaccinating all adults seems to be a waste of time and money for some. The way government deals with COVID 19 often seems to contradict what was previously said, not enough research has been done into the vaccine to warrant investing millions of pounds into it though. Iâ€™m not a believer in conspiracy theories but there does seem to be some underhand dealings in some areas concerning COVID-19.
