i feel sad that there is a current lockdown and so cannot move around. or go dancing, eating, doing sports with friends and general socialisation is hindered. it is also annoying that university is online and companies aren't hiring as much as before. i am also abit anxious about the covid vaccines and how safe they really are. it is a bit worrisome that is came out under a year when normally putting a new drug into the market takes up to a decade. my finances have been affected by covid and theres not a-lot i can do about it. i also have to study under this conditions which is not ideal. its hard finding motivation to study and do my lectures. exams are fast approaching and i barely know what is going on. i have failed to prioritise and manage my time wisely. not because i don't know how to do that but more to do with lack of motivation. i am also so worried about doing loads of things that i just lie down still and watch a tv show unable to do anything. this isn't new to me but i had a system in place to counteract this which includes going into university to study on campus or at my local library.
