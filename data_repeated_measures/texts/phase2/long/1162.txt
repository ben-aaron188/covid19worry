Although things seem to be getting better when immunisation is concerned, I worry that people will take it as a given that this is a cure all and become lazier with social distancing etc.  My fear is that with this will bring a further wave of illness where more people will die and mutations may occur which the immunisations will not work against. A lot of people seem to think they don’t need the jab or to listen to guidance and this is very concerning even with the decreasing death rate.

Hopefully I’ll be proven wrong!
