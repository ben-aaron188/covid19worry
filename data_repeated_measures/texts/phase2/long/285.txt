I think we are approaching the end of strict lockdowns and as society starts to open up again things will slowly go back to normal. I am reassured that the vaccination roll out is continuing at a good pace and hospital numbers are declining. I feel that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Also having had covid + recently I have been vaccinated, although I maintain the same precautions as before, I do not feel as worried for myself as I did before. At the moment I feel hopeful that things will get better.
