I am tired of the continuing situation but also nervous that the few benefits that have come from it will all be forgotten or abandoned in the rush to get back to normal. I didn't trust or like the government before this situation and nothing they have done has changed my mind, but I'm sad that generally people don't seem to agree. It seems they could do anything and people would still vote for them. I've been very lucky in that I haven't lost anybody to this disease, which probably makes me a bit complacent.
