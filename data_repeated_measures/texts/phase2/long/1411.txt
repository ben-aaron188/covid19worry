I feel fearful for mine and my family’s health and well-being as many people have suffered from COVID and have had long term health implications since. I feel anxious that things are not yet back to normal and not knowing what will happen in the future. It’s difficult not to be able to plan to celebrate important moments with extended family. I feel sadness because I feel over a year has been taken away from us all and we’ve all been trapped in a cycle of lockdowns which improve the situation with regard to protecting our physical health but it has a detrimental effect on our mental health. I feel anger that there is little support for the many experiencing poor mental health and physical health (long COVID or non COVID related) at this time.
