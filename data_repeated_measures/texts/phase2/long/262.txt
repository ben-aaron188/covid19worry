just very tried of the situation now, I want to be able to go out and see my friends and family after being isolated for the last year and I am more than ready to get out and about. And to see something in a different place in a different location within the UK.

I want to be able to go out and do some shopping in the stores without social distancing measures being in place and would be able to take my time browsing the shops without worrying about the potential queue that might be outside the retailer.

I am also ready to interact with othe people that are not people who live in my household
