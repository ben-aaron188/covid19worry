I feel sad about everything that happened up to date, from deniers to politicians who acted too late and the deaths that were the consequence. I feel hopeful about the vaccination. I feel anxious about the consequences of everything like the lockdown - the economy crashing, people not trusting each other, and entire generation not learning social skills for a year in school or with friends. I even feel anxious about ""going back to normal"" now. I feel like I am much more scared about germs in general too.
