Fed up. Been out of work for almost a year, no money, no job, all my prospects have been ruined (was a newly graduated music producer). Getting fat from staying in all day, losing hair from stress about money, not being able to see anyone etc. Knowing how much I've lost whilst also knowing I would be very unlikely to have had any serious complications from the virus is making me less and less supportive of the measures. Need to get back to life now, especially as in the area where I live there is basically no COVID at all now, less than 5 cases a week average for the last month.
