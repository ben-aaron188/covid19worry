It's still a very uncertain time. No work and looks like I'll have to start my business from scratch again in April. This time with no money, big over draft at the moment. Scared for the future, near AND far. Worried about finances but also about relaxing the covid lockdown rules. The vaccine scares me too - the side affects and long term issues, discrimination if you don't have it. Life will never be the same as pre-covid. I feel sorry for the younger people and next few generations. It is going to take a hundred years to pay for 2020.
