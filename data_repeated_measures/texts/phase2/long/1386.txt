I am fed up but hoping that this is the final hurdle and that we will soon be back to normal life in the very near future, fingers crossed. This being said, it does feel never ending and I do feel like this has been the worst lock down yet. For this lockdown it started in the depth of winter and is so cold that I feel that there is less joy around the place. It was easier to stay positive when the weather was nicer. All I can think about is when life returns to normal but I don't know wheh this will be. I am hoping that it will be very  soon but I just don't know. I also miss seeing my family and friends and can't wait to see them again once this is all over.
