I am so sad about lost opportunities, my teen has missed so much in terms of time developing friendships and building bonds, I feel like my world has shrunk and that even my parents are so remote they may as well not be real.

Vaccination is looking hopeful but still so much uncertainty and I can't cope with planning things for them then not be able to go ahead, which then means I don't feel like much to look forward to.

Everything is just on hold.

Locking down I believe was and is right but the price is huge
