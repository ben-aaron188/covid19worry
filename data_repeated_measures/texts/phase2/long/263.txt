I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now and feel things are looking up. Life doesn't feel overly different now the children are back at school and nursery. 

I feel like I'm going to have work very hard and feel very overwhelmed by this to eradicate the difficult financial position that the coronavirus pandemic has put on our family life. 

I don't fear for my family and friends now I know a good proportion have had their first vaccine. I am still anxious on the impact on my children, their mental health and socialisation have been impacted terribly and I worry how this will effect them in the future.
