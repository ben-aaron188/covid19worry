I feel much better about the Corona situation currently. I am still anxious about potentially catching or spreading the virus, but I am comfortable in the knowledge that I am doing a lot of things to avoid this. I feel more positive about the future, but I also feel hesitant to get my hopes up about things improving in case something happens to change current progress. I do sometimes feel sad thinking about life before Covid and how out of reach it is now, but I am now more able to take myself out of that mindset and focus on the present. Ultimately, I feel slightly cautious about how I approach the situation right now, but I feel better.
