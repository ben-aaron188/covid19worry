I am feeling angry because I feel that I have wasted one year of my life.   I retired to travel and spend time with my family in another part of the UK and have been stuck at home.  I am angry because people have made bad decisions at the start of the pandemic and because the public have also not followed the rules last year.  The most prevalent feeling is one of wasted time.

I am angry because I feel that people have died unnecessarily due to those bad decisions at the start of the pandemic.  We should have locked down earlier and we are still making bad decisions with regard to closing borders and letting in people too easily.

I am anxious in case I catch the virus - I don't know how I might react to it even though I am fit.
