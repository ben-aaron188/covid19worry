I am very angry at everyone breaking the rules, meaning we will be in this longer. It's not fair when others are abiding by them! It's so scary too when people don't take it seriously, people need to wear masks and socially distance and wash their hands properly. I am anxious and scared, I just want to see my loved ones and go on holiday and enjoy my time. I want to live as normal, but it's not possible right now... It should be back to normal soon I hope, I fear what will happen to mental health and the economy if it isn't, jobs can't survive
