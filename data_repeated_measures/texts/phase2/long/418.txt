I am frustrated that lockdown continues even though cases have dropped so low. I feel we are risking the lives of younger people who are missing cancer screenings etc, and I know of several people who have committed suicide because of the current situation. 
Somehow government is no longer taking off a trade off between lives, it’s all about saving the elderly and vulnerable. But they have had their vaccines by now!
We should reopen the country and get the economy working again as soon as we can. It’s not a case of money vs. lives, the economy is lives. 
Also our children have missed out on so on much of their youth and their education.
