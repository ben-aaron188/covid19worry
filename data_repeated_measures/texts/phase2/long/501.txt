It concerns me that people are going about their daily lives like nothing is happening. People who’ve had their first vaccine seem to think they’re now immune and can do as they please. Two people I know have died from covid since 1st February, it’s still a very real threat. I’m worried for everyone I know, and concerned that people who’ve stayed safe up to now have become wreckless. Im still shielding almost entirely, and will do so until I’m allowed not to by law AND have had both parts of my vaccinations
