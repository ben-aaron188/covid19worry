I took a job as an essential worker 6 months ago.  When I took it I was a bit more anxious about catching or spreading the virus.  Six months later and that fear and anxiety has dwindled.   I think I have accepted the fact that I might get it, but I am doing everything I can to protect myself and my family.  I wash my hands constantly and expect my children to do the same, especially after coming in from outside.  We use hand sanitizer regularly.  I wear a protective gown, gloves and protective glasses at work, and dispose of my PPE carefully and properly.  I am not going to live in fear, but I am going to live with caution.
