At this moment I'm apprehensive about the virus. I'm worried the relaxation at lockdown will have a similar effect as last time and many people are not yet vaccinate, myself and children included and that makes me anxious. I also struggle with change so going back to some form of normality is unsettling for me. The last minute planning and arranging of these things makes me feel like I'm not in control. Hopefully it will be more positive than how I'm feeling at the moment. My anxiety hasn't taken over yet and instill feel in control to a point so that's good.
