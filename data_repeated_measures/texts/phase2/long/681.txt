I feel that the pandemic is at a lower level now.
Personally I’m m more relaxed but that doesn’t mean that the threat has gone away.
People mustn’t forget the seriousness of keeping clean,sanitizer is readily available at multiple intervals & lots & lots of dispensers are there.
I’m relaxed & happy-comfortable with myself & wife.I’m going to daily work under strict masks & visors with daily temperature controls in place.The workplace has been well organised because the production lines have been separated with staggering of start times/colour coded lanyards,social distancing.
