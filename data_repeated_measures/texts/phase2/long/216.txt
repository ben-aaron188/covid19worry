at the moment i feel frustrated the main reason is the slow pace of lockdown and the continued high death rate i am hopeful that in time the vaccinne will work but it does seem sadly a long way off.my work duties are tied to home working and i find it hard to keep interested in my work at this time luckly i am on full pay so that helps my income and outgoings ,my family are returning to school soon and my partner is arranging childcare for the next phase of the normalilisation of the siduation.the children going back to school should help to make things easier as they are bored and home schooling is a nightmare
