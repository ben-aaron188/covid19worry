I am feeling fed up, tired, lonely, missing my family, feel like life has come to a stand still. Feel like I've been waiting waiting waiting for I dont know what. I feel isolated, bored, winter has been tougher than it usually is with the isolation mixed with the dark, wet and cold. You can't do much to escape it January and February were longggg months. I don't really have much more than that to say. Would be helpful to have a word counter on this box so you know how much you have to write.
