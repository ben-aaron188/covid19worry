I am optimistic that with the Vaccination roll out that is currently being implemented will give us release from lock down and get back to a new normal. We will however still need to be cautious as to distancing and wear masks when in crowded spaces.
The economy will take a very long time to recover and a lot of independent retailers on the high street will take a long time to get back to their financial position pre pandemic with the outlook for some businesses quite poor and may well go out of business. Cash as a mainstay of payment now is not the normal and banking on the high street will be more difficult as banks take the decision to go online and reduce their face to face contact possibilities. Working from home an option for several types of business leading to no need to have a main/head office and use rented conference facilities when the need for large events is required leading to reduced costs.
