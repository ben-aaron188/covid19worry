I am feeling positive that the situation is now ending and that people are starting to live properly again. The vaccine rollout has been very quick and we can now look forward to holidays again. I do feel that some time has been wasted and that things like the Christmas gatherings shouldnâ€™t have happened if the three month lockdown was the result. I would have preferred to have a small Christmas celebration and leas restrictions are this time such as the restaurants and shops being open. I can see that the older age groups are now out and about more, very much not sticking to social distancing and driving slowly on the roads, but I also understand that they may not have been out in a year and the world is quite a different place now.
