I’m feeling fed up of the covid situation, fed up of social distancing, not seeing family and not being able to go shopping. I wish my son and daughter could return to their educational settings as normal. 

I’m also desperate to get my hair cut and visit friends. I just hope the vaccines enable us to live more normally very soon and that people stop getting seriously ill from COVID. 

Hopefully this nightmare will soon be over for the World. I also hope the financial cost of this crisis is not as severe as imagined.
