I am stressed and anxious as I am struggling financially and can't see an end to the whole mess the country is in.  My income dropped due to covid and I have been unable to find a job with more hours. There is no clear guidance so things just seem unsure and unstable.  So may people have been affected by mental health and are spiralling deeper in to a bad place. Financially the country seems in an unstable state.  I am feeling more anxious and irritable on a daily basis.  Other countries seem to have light at the end of the tunnel and we are still in limbo
