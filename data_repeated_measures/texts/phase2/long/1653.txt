I am more concerned that the government still isn't handling the covid situation well than I am about actually catching the virus myself. The idea that we could be put in another lockdown after the current one worries me especially with the amount of vaccines and time that has gone into trying to return life back to normal. Although I understand it is a horrible virus that has affected people all over the world, I haven't personally had it nor anyone else I'm close with, the main way I've been affected is since last March I've only been to my university once for a practical and so my education has been negatively affected.
