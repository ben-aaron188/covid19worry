More frustration than sadness in all honesty. This third lockdown has felt longer than the others, more restrictive because of the season and boring as every task has been done numerous times. Also felt fear as the death toll grew and hospitalised cases grew younger as the variants became more prolific and harder to control. But also hope that the vaccination programme will help reduce a repeat of the awful death toll in January. I also feel like I’ve forgotten how to socialise with people (furloughed from hospitality) meaning I’ll have nothing interesting to talk about when restrictions are lifted.
