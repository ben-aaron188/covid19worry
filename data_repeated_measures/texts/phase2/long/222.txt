I am upset and saddened about it right now. there is no need for the country to have been in lockdown this long, had it had been started quick and strong enough we could have been over it by now. I feel hopeful about the vaccinations. I am slightly angry about how things are as well. I am happy the children are back at school, bit of normality for them, and interaction with other people. I am mostly upset. Other countries have shown excellent displays of leadership and I don't feel like we have had that at all. We finally have a clearer plan but I don't know how much I trust it or the people giving the plan.
