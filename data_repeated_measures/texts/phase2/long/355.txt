There is nothing we can do and just following gov guidance and hoping that soon it will remain in past and we will be back to normal without all this restrictions. The only one thing which really makes me upset is travel restrictions. I miss my family and friends as they all leave far away some in this country but as far that you can’t just come and go back same day. Just living in hopes for normal life that people will be responsible and wear this masks or stay home if they got ill. I stayed in self isolation because of being in contact with person who had COVID and it wasn’t so hard to stay for 10 days to keep people safe.
