I feel bored of it. I understand that it is a huge deal and that we shouldn't be taking this situation lightly but I am bored of being stuck in the house and not being able to do the activities that I want to do - socialising, going out to places etc. I am not worried about myself getting ill, I only worry for older family members but with the vaccine programme I am hopeful for the next few months and the chance of being able to go out and do what I want again. I am also slightly nervous that the UK roadmap out of lockdown will be pushed back because I don't think I can wait too much longer to be able to live my life properly again
