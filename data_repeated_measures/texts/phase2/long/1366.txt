Recently I have been quite relaxed in terms of the covid situation. I have been self-isolating and feel better than ever in my isolation. I don't want to risk anything so I do not go outside unless it is crucial. Every time I have to go out shopping for food and necessities I try to stock up for the next 2 weeks at a minimum so that I can minimize my time spent out in public where the virus could be spread. I also wear my mask and constantly sanitize my hands. I have had multiple tests in the past few months and have tested negative each time.
