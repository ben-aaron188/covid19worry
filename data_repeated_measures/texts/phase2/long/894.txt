Last year, coronavirus was something new. No one knew much about it and it was scary the way it spread throughout the world. 
At present, we have loads of information and loads of research being done which has decreased my fear of it. However, I feel sad when I think of the lives lost and how much the economy has been affected because we were not fast enough to stop it spreading. I feel like the coronavirus is going to be like the flu situation where we would have to get yearly vaccinations to stay healthy.
