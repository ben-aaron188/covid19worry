The UK has received a lot of flak for the vaccine situation before the eu got any but I think the eu has shown to the entire world what type of people they are... insincere and dishonest.  I am feeling very good at this moment in time.  I have now had the 1st part of the vaccine and now await the last one.  The UK has found that we are in a small minority whose deaths are vastly reduced and the lockdown is working very well along with the vaccine programme. I am extremely hopeful that we are doing the correct regime for the numbers to come down and look forward to getting back to a more relaxed and wholesome life soon!
