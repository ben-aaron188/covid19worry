I would still be very worried. While the vaccination process is working well the new variants gives us plenty to think about. Lockdown is becoming quite tedious but it has to be done. I realise that people are of the opinion that they won't get infected, that it will happen to someone else, we still cannot get complacent. We must ensure that we follow any guidance that is given by the medical people and the Government but should not be rushing out of the lockdown as we want to ensure that this lockdown is the last one.
