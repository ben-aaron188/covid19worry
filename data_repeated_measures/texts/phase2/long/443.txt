I still worry for the health and wellbeing of my family and friends, but my level of immediate concern has receeded somewhat with the onset of the vaccination programme and probably just from having lived in this pandemic world for some time now. I'm at the stage where I feel like I can start to begin looking at the future once more. In some ways I'm sure life won't back to the way things were but I'm looking forward to a time in the not too distant future when I can once again spend time in person with those that I love.
