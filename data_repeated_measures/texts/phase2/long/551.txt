just tired. the govt has continually messed up by taking a reactive policy stance, rather than proactive. It's tiring feeling like we're in a never-ending cycle of not learning fro our policy mistakes. 

I don't have the mental capacity to process the sheer amount of death and destruction it has caused, and even less to process how other countries e.g. new zealand, have taken a completely different approach and are living life with no restrictions and 21 (?) deaths vs our 120,000.

Not sure anyone is really paying attention much anymore, I can't bring myself to watch the press conferences because it's just a painful hour of politicians being politicians, not answering questions, and scientists doing their best despite.
