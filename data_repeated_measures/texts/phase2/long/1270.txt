I am feeling very sad and deflated. Finally, we managed to hear some good news. I am looking forward to having my freedom back. I am very tired of being restricted of only going for walks. It's become tiresome. I am excited to do something different. At this moment in time, it's far too repetitive. I miss playing football in my indoor league. It has not restarted since March 2020. I'm looking forward to it finally being allowed to resume. I am agitated and infuriated of staying at home and having the same routine. Life is stale and it is extremely difficult to stare at a computer screen for 12hrs of the day.
