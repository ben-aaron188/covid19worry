I am frustrated about the prolonged lockdown in the UK after Christmas, as I feel outdoor sports should've been allowed to continue. I'm looking forward to some return to normalcy from the 29th March and onwards. I am disappointed by the eased restrictions around Christmas time, as I feel they are responsible for the 3 month lockdown that we are currently in. I am very much looking forward to June 21st (fingers crossed on the date), even though  I am starting a new job that day! It has been a very strange year and am looking forward to things being back to normal
