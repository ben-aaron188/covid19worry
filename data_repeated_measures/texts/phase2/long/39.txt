I am worried about how effective the vaccination programme will be (how long will the protection last, and if other countries don't vaccinate then new strains might appear). I'm concerned about the accuracy of the lateral flow tests as the children go back to school. I am still staying in as much as I can. I am annoyed about the amount of money that has been spent in the name of covid, lining politician's pockets. I am worried about the people falling through the cracks, unable to access any financial support (I live in an affluent area and our local foodbank is incredibly busy). PLus I'm a bit fed up of being stuck inside, not being able to go anywhere.
