I feel unsafe to get out of my home as I can see lots of people are not wearing face covering on the street or outdoor. For indoor, there are still some people are not wearing face coverings. Also, I don't think the covid vaccine will work against new variants. So it is not worth to get the jab now. I prefer to wait for the new oral drugs and medicines in my opinions. I am very opposed to the vaccine passport because it is meaningless as the virus can still transmit after you get the vaccine. Also, it may not protect people from new variants. So I prefer to wear face covering instead as it can prevent the virus getting into the body whichever the variant is.
