I am feeling that things are starting to improve, but will have to see what the effect of easing lockdown does and the impact on cases and hospital admissions. I feel optimistic for the future but worry if things will ever be like normal was before covid. The whole world seems to have changed, I am not sure if it will ever go back to how it was.  Also whether the vaccines will be required every year and how the nhs will cope. Also how we can fight mutations if borders are opened up.
