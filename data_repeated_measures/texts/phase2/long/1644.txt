Frustrated at the government and their clear lack of ability especially when we see other countries being able to move back to normality. A lot of distrust with the Government, not sure whether to get my hopes up with the current road map as I just feel like everything that the Government has said about moving back to normality thus far they have had to go back on. Frustration and anger at the lack of accountability that the Government have towards their actions over the past year. The current debacle about track and trace and contracts just being given to friends of members of the government rather than people and companies with experience in the fields of the contracts.
