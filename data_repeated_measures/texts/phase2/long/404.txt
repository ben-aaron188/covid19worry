I feel we are turning a corner and if people  can just manage not to screw  it up long enough to vaccinate everybody we can get back to normal. The government have handled this abysmally , luckily private companies have boxed off and created vaccines a d the nhs have dealt with the vaccination. The next step should be getting our money back for the failed test and trace and prosecuting those involved in the cronyism and ppe scandal. Something needs to be done and the people responsible for the failure and death rate need holding to account.
