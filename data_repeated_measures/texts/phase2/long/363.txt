I feel quite frustrated at the little choice and variety of things we have to do, but I also feel sad and a bit apprehensive. My closest friend lost her brother to Covid a week ago which is both frightening and tragic. He was otherwise healthy and it just goes to show how vulnerable we could all be to this illness we still know very little about,
I miss spending quality time with the people I love and am sick of speaking to people through screens. I also worry I have forgotten how to socialise well and have become more reclusive.
