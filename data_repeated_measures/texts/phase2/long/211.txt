I am just completely fed up of the situation. It is a year on now, and don't really feel like we have progressed much. I am tired of struggling to work from home whilst home schooling three children, but looking forward to them returning to school next week. I am slightly apprehensive that there will be another lockdown, but thanks to more regular testing and the vaccine I am not as anxious about the virus as I was before.
I look forward to things open up again and being able to go places again, although I am in no rush to go on holiday. I haven't really missed much with regards to pubs and cinema etc. I would like for the kids to be able to have some sort of life though, and worry about their lack of social interaction. I am also worried about the eldest's schooling and what exams will look like for him.
I am not a hugger, but I look forward to hugging people again.
