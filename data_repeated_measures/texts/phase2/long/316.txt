I'm feeling quite anxious about coming out of lockdown and wondering if it's too soon. 
Everyone I know appears to be pleased that there seems to be an end on the horizon but I can't help thinking that we should be being more cautious and taking things a bit slower.
I would like some level of normality to return but I don't expect it will be anything like what it used to be. Restrictions and this way of living make me feel out of control of my own life and the way I like things to be done. 
I fully anticipate that we will be locked down again in the future despite assurances that this will not happen again and we will continue to move forward.
