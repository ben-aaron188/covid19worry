I have good feelings of my local area and country as a whole, due to the high take up of the vaccine.

I am however dismayed by mixed messages given by government rules, such as not allowing travel .locally, but allowing flights to different countries.

On the whole, I have glimmer of hope and start seeing light at the end of the tunnel, as far as lock-down goes.

I have personal hopes increased especially, as I have recently received my vaccination, and was happy to see a high turnout for the vaccination when I went to receive mine.
