I feel optimistic about the coronavirus situation at the moment.   Things are starting to improve and the news coverage about coronavirus recently has been optimistic as well.  I am very hopeful that this is nearing the end of the coronavirus pandemic.  Hopefully things will start to return to normal over the next few months.  It has been a long year dealing with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on day to day life so i will be very grateful when the situation is finally over.  I am looking forward to going about my day to day activities without having to think about coronavirus any more.
