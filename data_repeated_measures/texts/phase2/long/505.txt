I'm pretty bored of it all, the risk does not seem that high, not high enough to just stop doing anything. Should be allowed to go out if you are willing to take the risk. Do not think we are being told the truth, too may things are hidden or censored from us. I don't see why certain business are getting priority over others, the media is not essential, but rich tv and movie stars seem to be able to travel and do what they want whilst we are locked down. Other countries that don't have a lock down like us are doing ok. A lot of the people getting sick are fat and unhealthy so why should everyone else suffer for self inflicted illnesses. We could keep the real sick people safe whilst not having to lock everyone up.
