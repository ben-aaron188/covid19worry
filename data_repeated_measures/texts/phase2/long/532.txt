I currently feel excited by idea of next lot of restrictions being lifted to begin to see friends and family again. I am also looking forward to opening up of services such as restaurants and other hospitality sectors to be able to have more freedom. Particularly with spring and summer on way.
I am concerned about the economy with maybe even a recession looming  and especially the affect the closure of schools has had on children 
 however I worry for the long term particularly if everyone rushes to go on holiday again then we may be back in another lockdown come autumn
