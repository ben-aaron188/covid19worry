I feel there is starting to be more hope at the moment. 
Vaccine rollout, schools returning and the dates for the relaxing of restrictions. 
A part of me is nervous for things to return to normal after what happened at Christmas but I am hopeful that even if large events can't happen that we will be able to see family and friends soon. I have a 7 month old baby who has not met important people in her life but would be expected to start nursery soon, in a room full of strangers when she hasn't even been able to spend time with relatives.
