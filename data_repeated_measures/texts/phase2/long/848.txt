I feel that I am getting quite fed up of lockdown and feeling isolated. I'm trying to look forward to later in the year but even so still can't guarantee we will be allowed to do anything. It is still going to be over 3 months at least before we might be back to normal which is really hard and upsetting. I am glad that the vaccine is getting done so quickly but I will be a bit sad if vaccine passports are a requirement for certain activities as many young people will be last in line for the vaccine even though we are most likely safe enough to go out now..
