I am looking forward to UK reopening of its shops and eventually its bars. I feel confident and have hope that things will get better soon. I am also vaccinate and I am less scare about covid and also feel more confident and content. I look forward to enjoying the things I used to enjoy before covid.

I also look forward to seeing family again. It's been over a year since I seen most of my families.

I look forward to going out and eating out. I also look forward to going on holidays, both in the UK and also to long hual holidays to Asia.
