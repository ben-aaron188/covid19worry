I am Feeling hopeful now. I have not had my vaccine but I see the impact on the daily infection and death rates. I feel the roadmap could work - but I am fearful of variants that have gotten into the country. I look forward to some normal times soon - just some basic daytime socialising would be lovely. I am filled with desire for seeing my friends and having some time in the sun. However I am sad and angry about all the deaths that have happened and how the government has handled this. Many have died and much was avoidable
