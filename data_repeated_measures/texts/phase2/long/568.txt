I am used to working and staying at home, happy that there dates for lifting of restrictions. The vaccination rollout seems to to be going well and waiting for my jab.
Looking forward to being able to meet friends and family and get out a bit more and to make up for some of the things that I have missed. 
Slightly frustrated that we still have to wait but understand the reasons why.
