My feelings towards the corona situation is more about the impacts it will have on the economy and the ability to find work. I worry about my mum and her own business, whether it will survive or not post-covid and the impact this will have on her in years to come. I would therefore say that my feelings towards covid are largely financial worries. But I am also nervous to adapt to a more social way of life again when we are allowed and transitioning from work from home to office working. I have been working from home since august and this was my first job after graduating so I have not known any different; I used to work in a busy pub during university but as far as an office job goes I have conducted my work from the spare room and not an office full of people.
