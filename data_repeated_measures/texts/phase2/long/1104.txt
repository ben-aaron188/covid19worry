I am very anxious as the schools have literally just re opened and my son is back to school, i am anxious for him about how much time he has missed and how much he has missed his routine and his friends. I am sad because I miss everyone so close to me, i havent seen grandparents for months and my youngest child hasn't seen family in nearly a year and that is half her life wasted and gone from meeting everyone. 
I am annoyed and disgusted with the government for taking so long at trying to handle this situation, I am annoyed they are forgetting close friends of mine because they are newly self employed. I am annoyed at managers and business owners whop think the rules do not apply to them. My husband is NOT a key o9r essential worker, so why has he been working this entire time INSIDE peoples houses?! And not having the opportunity to be tested weekly etc.
