I'm not too concerned about the pandemic as I consider myself low risk. Take away the emotive side of it and statistically I have nothing to fear and very little to worry about. I don't personally know anyone who has caught it or died from it and believe that the press reporting of it is atrocious by spreading fear and anxiety into certain age groups which shouldn't have happened. The Government response has been mixed, but the way the UK is dealing with vaccinations proves that leaving the EU was a step forward as the EU have made a complete mess of their vaccination program. Apart from the leisure side of life my life has remained very normal with being out regularly and going to work daily.
