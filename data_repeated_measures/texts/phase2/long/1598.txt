Staying home turned me into an alcoholic. Hopefully, life will stop being so restricted by COVID soon, but I'm not very optimistic about this, seeing that even though we have above 30% of the population vaccinated, restrictions are slow to be lifted.
Also concerned about my ability to see my family which is in another country, and with the restrictions, it's near impossible to do that in the near future.
I also feel like I have completely lost my communication skills because of this long withdrawal from normal human interaction. Talking to people makes me anxious when it didn't happen last year.
