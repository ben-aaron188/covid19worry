I feel happy that I get my second injection next week and that the bulk of the population will soon be safer, this will enable me to see my family and friends, I still will feel that I should continue to take all the current precautions because of the idiots that refuse the injection. I feel sad and upset that so many have not taken this pandemic seriously.it affects everyone and everyone should take the same consideration for others .I cannot wait for a day when I can meet my family and friends again. I and so many others have missed so much and I feel sad for all those who have suffered and lost loved ones through the past year
