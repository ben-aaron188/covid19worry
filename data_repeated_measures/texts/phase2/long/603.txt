I am very worried about the current situation and the long term impact the pandemic has had on everyone.  We all crave some sort of normality but I fear people are becoming impatient and angry.  I am sad and worried about the future.  I am also is complete admiration for the scientists and the research to develop a vaccine so quickly!
I am disgusted with the devolved governments and their handling of the pandemic.  And over the last few days a 1% pay rise for NHS staff is appalling...clapping for them was a romantic notion to say thank you and now this 1% pay rise is shocking...they deserve more than that!
