I am very afraid of catching it as I feel it would be life threatening. I support heavy lockdown and am frustrated at people who donâ€™t take it seriously. I am pleased with the speed of vaccine development and rollout and see that as the only way out. Too many people think it is over or cannot be bothered to work to stay safe, which upsets me. I am frustrated that governments are reopening society too quickly which will lead to increasing death rates again, and have not been impressed with how Britain has handled this.
