I am happy about the fact that the vaccination programme is going well and that i have already been vaccinated. i am happy about the act that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that there is a date to aim towards in regards to going back to normal. It is also great that number of those getting the disease has decreased and that there are less people dying from COVID. It is just frustrating that is has taken this long to start having hope for normalcy. I am also anxious that while in the UK we are getting on top of getting everyone the vaccine, it is worrying that it isn't happening in other counties at the same pace and that we need to support other countries.
