I feel more relaxed about the coronavirus pandemic now that there is a vaccine being rolled out across the UK, although I am not sure about how safe and effective this vaccine is. I would willingly take the vaccine to be able to resume to a more 'normal' life where I can socialise with my friends and family, go back to studying face-to-face at university and generally feel more normal in life. I would also like to assure the safety of my household and loved ones by being able to take the vaccine.
