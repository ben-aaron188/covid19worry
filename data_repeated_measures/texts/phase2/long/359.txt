I am not bothered at the moment about the coronavirus situation as following being made redundant in October I start a new job next week. I believe that the vaccination program is beginning to show results and will allow life to return to some degree of normality in the next couple of months. After I get the vaccination I will feel even better about the situation despite the possibility of other variants not being protected against by the vaccines currently available. The speed and success of the vaccination development program bodes well for the future of vaccine development against other diseases.
