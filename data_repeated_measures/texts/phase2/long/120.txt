I feel anxious about the situation. I know the vaccine roll out is ongoing, but I worry that it might not be enough to contain the spread of the virus and that we might have to go through yet another lockdown. It feels like the whole pandemic situation is dragging on and on without any real end in sight. I wonder how much longer I will be separated from my family and friends. I was hoping to be able to go on holiday at Easter and now this is not possible. I also very much doubt that we'll be allowed to travel abroad for the summer, which makes me sad.
