I feel tired of the situation now I feel anxious about it ending and things returning to normal.I also feel hopeful that the time for things to get better is coming. I feel boredom at not being able to go anywhere. I feel resentment towards masks and I hate wearing them. I feel sad I cannot see my friends and do the things that we would normally do or go places we would normally go. I am tired of the situation and fed up of it all now and just want to return to some kind of normality and be able to go and do what I want and socialize
