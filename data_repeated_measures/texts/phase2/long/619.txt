I feel optimistic now the vaccine programme has worked so well and cases are falling country wide. I am hopeful that schools going back won't start another surge in cases and even if they do, the success of the vaccination programme should mean that cases won't translate to deaths. I think the media need to be more responsible and stop trying to scaremonger with stories about new variants. The science says these variants are of low concern but the media blow it out of proportion to get clicks and sell advertising space.
