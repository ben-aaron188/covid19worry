I think that it has gone on long enough and that there has never been any clear guidance on how we now deal the outcome of it all. 
I think that it had been mismanaged from the start and that things could have been a lot better. 
I think it has shown the best of people but also the selfishness of the vast majority of the country. Having spent time minding my own family and doing everything I could, I see too many others doing what they want. I haven’t seen my family in months and yet others have as they don’t care.
