i think corona is ruining my time and stopping me from enjoying myself and i am never going to be this age again and its getting ruined by corona. i am very anxious about everything now.. i am currently struggling to communicate to others now due to the first few lockdowns. i am scared to go outside however not because of catching the virus however scared i might have to engage in a conversation with another person. i do not know how i am meant to go back to how i use to be before corona started messing up my life.
