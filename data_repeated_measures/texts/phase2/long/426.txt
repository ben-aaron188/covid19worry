At the moment I’m feeling nervous about coming out of lockdown. Like others I have got used to working from home and not going out and need to get used to going out again which makes me anxious.
I also feel relieved that vaccines are being rolled out, family members have been vaccinated. The number of cases and deaths are going down which is promising. Shows that there might be light at the end of the tunnel and the end in sight.
It also makes me nervous if we need to have another lockdown in future. I think like a lot of people each lockdown is harder to do- the current one was the hardest! Especially in January when it’s dark all the time
