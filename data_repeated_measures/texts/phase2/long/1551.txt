I feel a bit anxious about the Covid situation. My wedding in September last year had to be rearranged, so I am nervous this will happen again.
I am also nervous for my family's and friend's health. I have had two family members die during the Covid pandemic and neither from Covid, but one due to mental health issues. It worries me that if this carries on much longer then people will feel more and more under strain
Funnily enough, I have actually benefited from some aspects of the pandemic, I have been able to do overtime and save enough to buy a house
