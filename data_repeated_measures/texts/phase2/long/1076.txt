I am very tired with it all. I feel sad that so much time has passed with so many missed opportunities. I feel sad for people who have lost loved ones. I have missed people and missed events and family birthdays and celebrations. I feel lonely through not being able to see and hug people. I do however also have some hope. I have had a vaccine. I have hope that things are getting better and that soon things will be more normal.
I believe that we will get through it but am anxious of the scars it will leave both physically and mentally.
I worry about the countryâ€™s financial situation and the job prospects for my children and grandchildren.
