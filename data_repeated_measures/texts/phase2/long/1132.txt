I feel anger towards the government for their incompetence in handling the situation and for all the unecessary deaths. I feel disgust at the pitiful pay rise offered to nurses despite their incredible work. I feel worried to be returning to my work place as a teacher as literally nothing has changed in terms of risk to mine and my colleagues health. We have no protection yet are expected to carry on as normal in rooms which are overcrowded and not for for purpose. I feel slight relief because my parents and my wife have been vaccinated and this has had a very positive effect on my mental health as I worry much less now. And i feel gratitude to the people responsible for creating the vaccine.
