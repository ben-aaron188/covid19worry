when covid first started appearing in early 2020 i really thought as supposdley clever and evolved humans, we would have got on top of it quickly. but we didnt. we were unprepared. Countries were reactive instead of proactive. people were selifsh. i feel like the entire last year has been a waste of time. people have died for nothing. But politicions and scientists still have their jobs, and money, and contracts. Numbers across the world were low in the summer but then it went up and we did nothing. then schools in uk opened and numbers went up, deaths went up, but nothing.
