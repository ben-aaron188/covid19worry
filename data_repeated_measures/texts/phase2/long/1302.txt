I feel a lot better compared to a year ago I feel its been around long enough now that we've almost sort of learned to live with it in a sense. Obviously it's still a terrible thing which has taken millions of lives, but I feel because of this vaccine it'll sort of fade out in a sense, for example other viruses and illnesses such as the flu we've just sort of learned to live with and I think the same will happen with COVID, which is why I'm not too worried about it anymore. The only part of this whole situation that still gets on my nerves is how badly local governments and institutions have responded, for example the UK government's lackluster rules on individuals coming from infected countries and not properly scanning them.
