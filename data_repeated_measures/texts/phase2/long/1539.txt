Quite fed up and frustrated of the ongoing lockdowns a year on. Living in an area in UK that has never been out of lockdown, thus have not been home to see my family in well over a year now. The frustration comes from seeing so many people every day not following the rules which undoubtedly lead to the lengthening of lockdowns for everyone else. Anger plays a part too when condsidering those who selfishly (for the most part) break the rules and I see my friends and oartner go to work as doctors in the local hospitals having no choice but to watch covid patient after covid patient come in to hospital. Generally like everyone though I'm just fed uo of it all whilst still anxious as to how lying it will continue and knowing that even once all vaccinated covid won't be going anywhere
