I am currently fed up. I have worked from home the last year and hardly been away from the house. I have been out for exercise but very rarely and have not seen my friends for a year. Christmas was okay as I got to see some of my family. But now I am just fed up and need to get out and see the world and my friends. I have been in regular contact with my son who is also self isolating working from home with his university work Iâ€™m sure it will be nice to catch up with him face-to-face. It what is 18th birthday during lockdown so I can look forward to having a legal beer with him
