I’m feeling optimistic because people are getting vaccinated and the number of cases is going down. We’re getting closer to the normal life we once had. 

Also I’m more happy because it’s getting close to summer time, if restrictions are lifted then most of us can enjoy the weather without being scared. 

I’m also feeling scared because when I finish school I’m uncertain about jobs since everything seems scarce right now and unemployment is very high. Also this pandemic may have had an impact on my learning abilities.
