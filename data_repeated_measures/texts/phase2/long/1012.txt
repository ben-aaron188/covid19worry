I don't feel about it anymore, if that makes sense. I think I am used to things the way they are. The only sad part is that I was not able to go see my family for over a year now, so I wish the travel could resume. The rest, I am not bothered anymore. Well, one more thing maybe - I am tired of online shopping. I wish we could go inside the store and try things as normal. I have lost weight so have no clue what my size is anymore. I want to be able to try things on as before. I got used to not seeing friends as often, and not being able to go out saves a crazy amount of money too.
