I feel hopeful due to the current figures in the UK and the data emerging in relation to the vaccine roll out. I am tentatively looking forward to things getting back to normal in a few months' time, particularly when I am able to get the vaccine myself. I am sad about the past year, those who have died and everything that we have missed. I am apprehensive about the future economic fall out and the ongoing impact on people's mental and physical health once the immediate crisis abates. I am looking forward to meeting up with family and friends more.
