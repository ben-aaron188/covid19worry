Fed up with the situation and the length of time this has gone on for. i feel sad for all that my children have missed out on for the last year. Feel sad for all the businesses affect by this and people who have lost their jobs. I feel like it will take a long time for things to go back to some normality. Hopefully brighter 
times are now soon ahead. The economy has been badly affected but this has hit some people harder than others. I have a greater appreciation for the outdoor now and this is something i have discovered during lockdown
