The pandemic is not an isolated 100yr event. It is evidence of escalating environmental collapse. Species that are endangered or at risk due to human induced habitat loss carry twice as many diseases potentially hazradous to humans. Since the 1970's 60% of animal life has been wiped out in the wild. At current rates this will have reached 100% by 2050. This loss of habit is mainly to make way for food. Everything is connected. This is turning into a bitter struggle for the soul of humanity, as we approach a point where we become the species that wipes out all others. Political leaders must be brought to justice and tried for Ecocide, reminiscent of the Nuremburg trials. The poorest will be at the sharpest end of this interconnected crisis. Our militaries are also drawn from the pooreres communities. A gathering call has already begun for our Military to eventually overthrow the State and bring an Ecocidal political system to justice.
