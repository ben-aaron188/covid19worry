I'm feeling drained about the situation at the moment because I'm tired of being locked up. I understand the need for it but it's hard, especially mentally. The vaccine being given out at such high rates is making me hopeful but the constant changing of when we're coming out of lockdown is annoying now. The majority of people I speak to feel the same and I can even see the effects it is having on children. I think there's going to be many mental health problems to be addressed once we're out of this being a major emergency.
