Just a lot of anxiety. I'm constantly paranoid that anyone I see could be carrying coronavirus so I've ended up just isolating myself from the world which isn't great. I also avoid people in my house as much as physically possible as they all leave the house for various reasons and for all I know they could have coronavirus, or someone they interact with outside could have coronavirus and I find it easier to just essentially hide from everyone I live with. So yeah, in conclusion, I've become a paranoid mess due to coronavirus. Also 500 characters is too much and I ended up having to repeat myself as I didn't want to make stuff up.
