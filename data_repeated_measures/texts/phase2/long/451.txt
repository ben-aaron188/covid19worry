I feel that we are through the worst of it and there’s some light at the of the tunnel. Once the majority of the population have been vaccinated we should be able to get back to normal. Hopefully by the summer we should be able to live our normal lives again, going on holiday and not having to wear masks all the time. As soon as masks aren’t compulsory I never want to wear one ever again. We just have to wait and hope that the vaccine works and we can live with this like we live with the flu. Hopefully the world will return to normal and there won’t be any silly little rules imposed on us.
