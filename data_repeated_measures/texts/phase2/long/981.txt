I am perplexed as to how the government could have done such a monumentally bad job but there be such little opposition to this. I am angry with Labour for their in action. I am angry with the public for continuing to support people who do not act in their interests. I am sad overall as I feel that there is no opportunity to make any positive change. 
My financial position has not changed. 
I am happier now since I have had a vaccine even if this was not delivered within the guidelines as per the people who developed it.
My team at work are experiencing wellbeing issues as they have experienced multiple workplace bereavements and personal losses.
