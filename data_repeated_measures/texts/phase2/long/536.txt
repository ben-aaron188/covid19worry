Having recently received covid vaccine and my country been in lockdown for a number of weeks , the statistics of the virus are on the way down with regards to deaths and infections which makes me feel a little more positive.I do however have concerns on new variants of the virus emerging but overall a little more positive.Once we emerge out of lockdown and the economy opens up more we may see infections increase and possible deaths increase which is a concern.The vaccine is really positive although we donâ€™t know how long for it protects us at this moment in time as it is a new vaccine
