angry and just plain cheesed off with all of it. Although slightly worried I feel we have wasted over a year. I am angry because I followed the rules yet so many lives were still lost. I am upset that my children lost out education, clubs, holidays, birthdays etc.
I am angry I was forced back to work as a key worker and not once received a thank you.  I am fed up and want to experience some sort of life with my children while they are still children.
I am angry/upset that I have to where a mask (pretty sure I am exempt but not worth the arguments).
