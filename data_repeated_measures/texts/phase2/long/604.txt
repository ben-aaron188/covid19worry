I feel very worried about upset about the Covid situation.  I think it has been badly handled by the UK Government and is leading to greater social divisions.  I am worried that it will take years for us to get out of this situation.  I am worried that life has changed forever and the true effects of the pandemic - health, social, educational - will not really be known for at least 10 years.  I think this has also been used as a money and power grab by the UK government while people are distracted.
