Overall I currently feel cautious optimism regarding Covid-19 mainly due to the improvement in deaths and cases combined with new vaccines being introduced. It has been a scary time as the numbers of the second peak were very high and then new variations of the virus created further concerns. Now I’m just looking forward to seeing my family and friends and having some normal life back. It’s been a testing time emotionally as I’ve not see my parents for nearly 3 months, probably the longest time apart in my life.
