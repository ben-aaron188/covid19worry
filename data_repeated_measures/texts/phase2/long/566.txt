I am now tired of all the restrictions placed on our lives. I have home schooled my children for 5 months in the last year whilst still working in essential services. We have had nothing to really look forward to and the whole situation seems dragged out. 


In the last year I have had no symptoms, none of my family have. I have been working out in the public and have been fine. I feel this could have been dealt with sooner. I don't feel like this is over either 

I have cancelled three weddings and have no idea when I can now get married.
