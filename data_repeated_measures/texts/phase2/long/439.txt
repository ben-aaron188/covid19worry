I feel a lot more optimistic about the situation as the vaccine is being offered to family members so I'm feeling more secure. I cant wait for things to be back to normal, I have confidence that things are going in the right direction. The death toll and number of people infected is going down each day which is very promising so there should be some normality very soon, hopefully by the summertime we can all get together again and do the things we used to enjoy doing. I'm happy that the old people in my community are now feeling secure after receiving their jabs
