The Corona situation makes me feel extremely isolated from my friends & family, although I can support 1 support bubble, it makes me sad to think of the time I am missing spending with other members of my family. I suffer from anxiety when I think about having to go out for food shopping from being in contact with people outside of my household. 
I worry about mine & my husbands job prospects if the businesses take a turn for the worst & the stress that his has on paying bills if either one of us loses our job.
