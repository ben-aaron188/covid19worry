I feel very worn out by the ongoing situation but also apprehensive about the dangers of 'getting back to normal'. I often feel as though there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I have frequently been disgusted and angry at the shocking failures in governance that have exacerbated the crisis and the lack of nuance in the discussion, especially in the media, about the costs and benefits of constantly flipping between 'opening up' and full lockdown with nothing in between. I am beginning to feel hopeful that things will improve, especially with widespread vaccination.
