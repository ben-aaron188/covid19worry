I’m feeling a lot more hopeful now. I’m a key worker and have been vaccinated as have several members of my family, which has helped to ease anxiety. I’m still nervous about whether we will come out of this lockdown soon but seeing other countries return to normal has given me hope. I feel calmer and less stressed. My general feeling now is one of boredom. It very much Groundhog Day! I miss having choices at weekends and hate that my son sees so few people. 
I do feel positive about my son returning to school, this will help enormously as I have struggled watching him be lonely and not being able to do what kids should be doing. 
So overall I’m feeling that we have light at the end of this tunnel and that has helped improve my mental health. January and February were extremely tough months.
