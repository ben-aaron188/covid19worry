I currently feel a lot of resentment towards all the individuals who chose to not believe those who were thing to help them through this. All the scientist and health professionals who worked so hard to solve this, who had their progress stunted by people who didn't believe in them. It will be 2 years of my life taken away from me due to the inefficiency of others, meanwhile those people continued to see anyone they wanted to. I lost my grandfather, uncle, and my childhood cat during this time - all while being unable to visit my family abroad during this time. I am anxious because maybe there's a chance others will get over this sooner than I will - I feel stunted by all of this. I do NOT blame quarantining and isolation for this, as things could have been done better.
