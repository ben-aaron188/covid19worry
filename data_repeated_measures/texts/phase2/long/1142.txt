I'm currently feeling hopeful that we are heading in the right direction and that the pandemic will soon be over and normal (or whatever the new normal is going to be)life can be resumed. I'm grateful that no one close has been affected too badly by the virus and I hope this continues. I feel sad for everyone who has lost a loved one. I'll be glad when I have the Covid vaccination and the rest of my family. I do feel worried about the financial implications that will follow this pandemic both for me and my husband and my sons.
