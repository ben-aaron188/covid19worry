On a personal level,  I am still very anxious about contracting Covid. I have a history of respiratory disease (tuberculosis), and the few reports I've found suggest this puts me at a greater risk of being seriously ill with the virus. The vaccine rollout has helped lower my anxiety slightly, and I am hugely relieved that my parents and sister have already had their first vaccinations. On a larger scale, the number of deaths in the UK makes me furious. The government handling has been poor beyond imagining - to the point where I'm finding it hard to talk about the lies, the corruption and the not-giving-a-shit about the public, particularly those who are elderly or disabled. It's difficult to live with both the anxiety and a high level of impotent rage, particularly as neither seem likely to be reduced any time soon.
