I am currently shielding this lockdown and although my husband is now working again (which he didn’t from Feb 20 to Oct 20) and my daughter is now back at nursery, I can’t help but worry. I am very much looking forward to seeing family and friends hopefully soon. End dates are in sight and there is light at the end of the tunnel. This lockdown has been the hardest due to weather and a feeling of de ja vu. I am also now pregnant which adds an extra worry but baby is due in July so I am hoping everything is pretty much normal by the time our family becomes a 4.
