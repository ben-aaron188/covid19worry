Over the past twelve months, there has been little to look forward to with the constant lockdowns and other restrictions. At the moment, I think the current situation is starting to look better than it has for the last twelve months. Now that more and more people are being vaccinated, the infection rates and deaths are starting to fall rapidly. I think that provided that people respect the rules for a few more months then, hopefully, life can start getting back to something like normal later this year.
