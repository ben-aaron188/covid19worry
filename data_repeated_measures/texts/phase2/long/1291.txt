I feel worn out by Coronavirus and the situation it has put us in generally. I'm patiently waiting for a call for me to book in for the vaccine and looking forward to being able to see my family as lockdown lifts over the next few months. I think life has changed a lot for many of us and this is the beginning of a new phase not just in my country but around the globe. I continue to think positively about this and hope that there will be many benefits to our changed ways of living that we haven't yet thought about. I have welcomed the slower pace of life from being at home much more and will continue to enjoy this as we move forward. My concerns remain that we have some way to go with the many variants emerging around the world but there does seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel now and I'm grateful for that.
