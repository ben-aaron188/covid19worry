At this exact moment I feel weary of Corona - I am a community nurse manager and just home from a night shift I had to work at short notice (again) as I could not find cover for staff shielding or off sick with covid. I am tired of nagging my team about PPE and other trust rules, tired of following those rules myself, weary of all the extra time every simple task takes, weary of trying to reassure patients and families and keep myself and my team safe. My community NHS trust has gone above and beyond to keep us as safe as they can - not all covid patients are in hospital - I cannot fault their efforts, but they can’t knit me any nurses to replace those told to shield or who are isolating or ill or who have retired early because they can’t take the pressure of covid anymore. I am angry at people who think the rules don’t apply to them and mix with friends and family because they are ‘OK’ and they are ‘safe’, angry at a small number of colleagues who claim to be such high risk they must not see covid patients under any circumstances yet have refused to be vaccinated, upset for their colleagues, some equally at risk,  who then have to take more than their fair share of the ‘covid team’ to cover for these fools, but overall I am just very very weary and would walk out of this job tomorrow given the chance. And the budget this week was just a slap in the face and another nail in the coffin.
