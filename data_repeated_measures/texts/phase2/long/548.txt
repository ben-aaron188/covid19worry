I'm feeling more hopeful but there is still an underlying negative feeling which could probably be characterised more as anxiety than fear. The disease has been devastating and I've been fortunate enough to not be impacted personally in terms of health, income (a little but devastatingly so) or personal loss. With regard to desire, there are many things I desire right now (restaurant, theatre, visiting a museum or gallery and seeing actual art but most of all of course seeing my family)but that is balanced by my sense of anxiety of the disease.
