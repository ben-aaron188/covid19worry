It has changed the whole dynamic of life giving an uncertainty and unease in everything I do both in my personal and work life. Also having to be strong for my children so they don't worry does create additional anxiety and also having to hide my worry and concern from them is difficult but they should not have to experience this worst of this and how it affects people both medically and mentally. What keeps me going is knowing this is a once in a lifetime event so just need to ride it out and hope everything will get better in the future.
