I am feeling anxious at the moment due to things opening up and not knowing exactly if this is going to work this time. This creates worry and fear. I am also feeling rather lonely as well at the moment which upsets me as I haven't seen my family and friends for a long time and am missing social contact and the happy emotions that that brings. there is also a feeling of hopefullness that this time round the easing of restrictions will work and we won't go back to another lockdown and things will go back to some form of normality over the summer and we can start to enjoy things again.
