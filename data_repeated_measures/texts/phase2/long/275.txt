I feel as though life is becoming far too repetitive. Lock downs seem endless and it feels as though we are existing and not living. Although lockdowns work to an extent they are not a realistic long term solution or one we should default to.I believe the government only uses them as they know people will comply now.

I believe that the world needs to begin to open up for the sake of everyone’s mental health and financial security.

As well, I believe no more future lockdowns should occur as people’s mental health is severely declining. We have to learn to live with the virus.
