I selected desire because I have the most desire to get back to some normality! I want to be able to have a bit of maternity leave where I can take my son to meet his family and my friends. Being locked down with 2 children has most definitely been challenging and I have had a few days where I needed to have time away from everyone. There has been moments of joy during the summer months but being pregnant and having my son all through the pandemic has been challenging, frustrating and a time I wonâ€™t forget in a long time.
