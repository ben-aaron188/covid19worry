I am worried about many things because of covid. my university texans begin in one months time and it has to be all online which worries me because i don’t feel like i have been getting the best quality of education with online school. my parents are now vaccinated but i still am not so i am still very cautious whenever i go to work or go outside. many customer that i interact with at work do not wear masks or follow the sociall distancing guidelines and it really annoys me. i feel like covid has made me a lot more reclusive because i don’t se my friends. i am always tired and bored about being indoors.
