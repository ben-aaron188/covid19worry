I feel quite fatigued by the situation and the lockdown. It feels like the UK response hasn't been good; we have lost lives and livelihoods. I want things to go back to normal but I understand the need for the current restrictions. I think the rollout of the vaccine has been really impressive and will definitely help get us back on track for ""normal"" life. I think COVID-19 will become part of every day life, a bit like flu, in the future. I miss my friends a lot, and with the restrictions I haven't been able to see them, as we can't travel. I think the situation has been going on so long that I'm feeling really tired. I am trying to think of the future and keep cheerful.
