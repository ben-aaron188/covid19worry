I feel hopeful about the current situation and am happy that relatives like my grandparents and parents are receiving the vaccine.  I feel extremely sad for all the lives lost and for the time I have not been able to spend with friends and family due to lockdown - particularly because i have a young daughter who has never seen her great grandparents or some of her grandparents due to lockdown.  I understand this has been a necessary sacrifice though, and hope we will soon be able to see and hold our loved ones.

I am grateful that no close family has suffered or died from the virus and hope that stays the same.
