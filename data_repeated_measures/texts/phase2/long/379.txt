I am still very scared of Corona and what it means for our future. I have now had both my vaccines but I don't think this is a fast ticket out of this. I am less worried about the safety of my family and friends as we have had a lot of doses of vaccine, but have anxiety that Corona could mutate further and there will be a strain that comes along that knocks us all for six. I am happy it is Spring and the sun is out, that gives hope. The winter has been bleak and depressing under lockdown, now we have sunshine everything feels a bit better.
