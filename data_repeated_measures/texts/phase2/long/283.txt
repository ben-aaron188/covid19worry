I'm tired of the Covid situation now. We need to start getting back to normal and reopening shops and businesses. The most vulnerable people have already been vaccinated, and everyone else will be vaccinated soon, so it's time to get life back to normal. I no longer feel worried or anxious about Covid, if I catch it then it shouldn't affect me too badly. We can't lock everyone away just to save the most vulnerable people in society. I think we need to let people have more freedom and be responsible for their own health.
