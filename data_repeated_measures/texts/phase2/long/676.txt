I feel much more resigned and pessimistic. I don't feel excited about things reopening. I feel anxious about readjusting to a more normal life. I feel tired even though I do nothing. I fear we will be back in lockdown by winter again. The government has failed absolutely everyone and has relied on people's goodwill for too long. I worry coronavirus is just the beginning and we will experience many more pandemics and the government will have learned nothing. I worry about the long term effects this will have on everything, how people's personalities and course of their lives has been altered by this.
