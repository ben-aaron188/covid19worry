I now feel optimistic and positive we will be through this by the end of the year - and at least to some sort of normality. I'm hopeful we are through the worst, especially with the vaccines and falling cases/hospitalisations. I'm looking forward to travelling again, seeing my friends and family. The only worry I have is will this happen again, what if we end up in the same place as before and things will never get back to normal. This means I have some anxiety still but less so than before. I'm trying to look forward, not look back and be optimistic.
