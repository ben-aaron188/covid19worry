I feel angry about the current situation as it’s been a year now that we are living with restrictions that are ruining people’s livelihoods and mental health.
On the other hand I feel for those who are sick or lost someone close to them.
It really is a mixture of all kind of feelings.
Me and my family adhered to all regulations and I am furious how much sacrifice we made compared to those who were flouting the rules, having parties and enjoying themselves. I just want this whole thing to stop.
Hopefully it’s our turn soon to get the vaccination, I guess it’s another reason to be grateful that we are at least not in any of the categories that would make us a priority.
