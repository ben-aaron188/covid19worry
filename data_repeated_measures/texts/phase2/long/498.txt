I’m feeling Anxious about the coronavirus because it has greatly impacted upon people livelihoods and the economy. I have missed greatly the freedom in being able to do what I want before Covid and I feel that Covid has put a stop to a lot of that. I also feel that the lockdown has put a huge strain upon peoples mental health. It has cost peoples lives as well as put the national health service under great pressure because of the strict rules that have been put in place. I feel that it has also contributed towards the destruction of peoples businesses and the downfall of many companies as it has put loads of people out of work. Despite Boris Johnson putting in place a roadmap to freedom, I feel that a harsher lockdown should of been implemented as I feel that we would’ve been out of this mess way earlier then we are now as we are doing incredibly bad in terms of having higher death rates then our European counterparts. I am very happy but also hopeful that we will be out of this lockdown by the 21st of June.
