At the moment I feel quite anxious about Corona, I don't really believe the numbers on the tv about the number of people vaccinated as had a nightmare booking my older parents in for a vaccine. It feels like a lot of the older generation has been forgotten about, so makes me think at the moment it's all very disorganized. The schools go back on Monday and I worry that the number of infections might get sky high again. I want to have some sort of life this year but not sure it will be possible with Covid which makes me quite depressed at the moment.
