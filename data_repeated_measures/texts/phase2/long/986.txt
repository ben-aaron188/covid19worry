I am hopeful about vaccinations and believe they will gradually improve the situation. But I am sad about worsened situation in some places, particularly at home. I don't worry about myself but about other vulnerable ones. I am a bit angry about some people not sticking to safety regulations but I understand as I am also frustrated about being in lockdown and not being able to see family. At the same time, I am frustrated to have to keep working as an essential worker while some people earn enough money without working.
