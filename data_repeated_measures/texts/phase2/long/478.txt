feel fine. I'm well protected and follow the rules accordingly. I'm not worried at all by the vivid. We as a family tested positive in August last year. But has followed all protocols as to what we should do. If we keep are self's safe then that is all that matters . We follow the rules then it should bwe more difficult to pass on the symptoms to other people
 Also I'm a key worker so it is a priority to keep others safe in the line of work that I do. Can't think of anything else to write so just trying to get to the 500 chracters
