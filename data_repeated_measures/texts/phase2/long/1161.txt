I feel that my country has the situation managed and under control. I feel at ease after following government guidance that I am protected. I feel relieved that some of my family members have already received the vaccine and I am happy that I will eventually receive it too.
I am not worried about the virus because I know what steps to take to prevent myself from catching it e.g. reducing the amount of unnecessary journeys I take on public transport, only going out for essential shops, washing my hands and disinfecting surfaces.
