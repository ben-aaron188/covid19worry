I feel it could have been handled better - frustrated with the government’s mixed messaging. They continuously praise key workers yet no real reward given for the hard work they have done during the pandemic. Feel that everyone is in limbo. Quite frustrated and not sure if this will be the last time that we have to put our lives on hold. Worried about getting ‘back to normal’ and that it will be a new normal, such as quieter high streets as many shops have gone bust. Also public services being unable to operate in the normal way, such as face-to-face work with service users.
