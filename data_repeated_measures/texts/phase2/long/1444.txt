I feel kind of happy and much more relaxed then at any time since the first lockdown in March 2020 that is appears to be coming to a conclusion with the roll out of vaccines to most age groups and the reopening soon approaching. It is tinged a little though with some sadness over all that have died due to catching covid and missing my family for extended lengths of time in the last 6 months and how my elderly parents hve probably been very lonley during this as they were self isolating much longer then anyone else.
