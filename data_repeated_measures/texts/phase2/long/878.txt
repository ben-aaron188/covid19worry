Very annoyed and exasperated about the handling of this by the government. Sorry for the families that have lost people. Unbelievable how people still don't see the government made maybe mistakes. Thankful for scientists who have developed the vaccine. Hope that we all might get it, query that we aren't sharing with the world. If the world isn't vaccinated then we will get mutations and we will all be in danger. We have prioritized economics instead of human health. If we had prioritised human health we would have taken care of the economics and been in a much much better position now.
