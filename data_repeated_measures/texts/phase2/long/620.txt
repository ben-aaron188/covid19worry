I feel optimistic that the end of the pandemic is near. Cases and death rates are falling daily and hospital admissions are reducing. The vaccination program is going very well. I’m hopeful the risk of covid is finally reducing abc becoming manageable. I expect annual vaccine boosters to control new variants of the virus.
Lockdown has been difficult and hard for everyone but the efforts and definitely paying off and I’m hopeful normality will return shortly.
The difficult part will be keeping to current restrictions and not becoming complacent and relaxing too soon.
