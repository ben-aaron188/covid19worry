The vaccine rollout going well (20 million people have got the first dose) is making me hopeful, however the sheer amount of people still not wearing masks despite the virus still being around is making me a little anxious. 
Hopefully it gets stamped out for good, but i am slightly worried it's just going to stick around forever, what with the new mutations springing up regularly all around the globe.
i am also worried about the relief packages being stopped far too soon, to the detriment of the working class.
