Hopeful but also fed up. Things are looking good with the vaccine role out but lockdown fatigue is dragging. I’m excited for things to start opening up again, but equally frustrated that some nations within the uk haven’t published dates or data for when things will actually open up. I hope this is the last lockdown we will ever have to have and don’t think our country can survive another one, due to the mental and economic impact. I would be fine with mask wearing and social distancing but otherwise would be frustrated with other lockdowns. It’s embarrassing that the UK as an island, has such a poor record with COVID compared to other counties such as Australia and New Zealand. I am also a bit worried these variants could put us back to square one if we allow them spread through the nation and the vaccines don’t protect us from them.
