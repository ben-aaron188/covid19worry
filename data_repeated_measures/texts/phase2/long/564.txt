i worry about mixing with people socially again when lockdowns are over more so than the virus itself, it is like i have forgotten how it works.It will probably be easier than it seems currently. It feels like it is on the way to being resolved but 'normality' is a way off. I have been luckier than many because i am a key worker so have continued to work and actually have progressed in my job, i have learned many new skills that i may not have done otherwise which makes me overall positive about the future.
