Want it to be over now. Longing for normality to return so that I can go things like visit places and go on holiday and go out with my friends. Feel happy that my family have gotten off lightly though, there have been no cases in my family and several members have already been vaccinated. I'm grateful that none of us have gotten the virus. I just hope that the vaccination program works so that things can start to open up again. A lot less fearful than I was last year as the vaccine is bringing down cases.
