I am sick of hearing about it, we need to get on with our lives, corona is here to stay just like the flu so we need to pull up our socks and start living again. If we all get the vaccination then it will near enough stop the spread of the virus and we as a world will start to live normally again. I have stopped watching the news and following on facebook as this just spreads more fear amongst us. I will be much happier when we can go on holiday and see our friends, pop to the shops without having to queue or wear masks.
