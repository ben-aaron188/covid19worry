Its getting better. But I'm worried when things are relaxed it will spike again and we will forever be in a lockdown if the vaccines dont work. Hopefully I'm working but we just dont know but when the summer comes we will have a better idea. It has been a very bad year mentally and financially abs I'm hoping we can all go back to normal at some point soon, that would be very pleasing indeed. That is all I have to say really on this matter at this time, I hope its what you are looking for response wise and hope the researching is going well.
