Sisgisted that my children's school has been closed since dec 2020 with no date.for reopening yet.  I think the schools have been an easy target with no real thought to how this is impacting on the children's educational needs, mental health and socal development.

I think the teachers unions have caused the situation and are using covid as an excuse to not be in school.  Every other profession is continuing even with risks so why not schools.

My job is secure so not too concerned about that, athlough it has been very difficult to home school and work fu time.  I think I am more stressed, mental health issues than I am aware.of  but I am getting the vaccine next week so am hopeful that things are starting to get back to normal. But concerned.there may be another surge
