I am fearful, working in education without being prioritised for a vaccine. 

I am angry that I had my first baby in April 2020 and my experience as a first time mum has been hugely impacted by COVID 19. I had to labour on my own in hospital, I had to stay for three nights without my partner being allowed to visit. Our after care has been impacted by the lack of services available. I have not seen my family due to restrictions as much as I would like. I last saw them in October, they have missed out on my daughter and I have missed out on support. Current restrictions in place mean I can’t even have any celebrations for her first birthday with my family. I appreciate thousands have died, however this is how covid has impacted my life personally. 

I am so angry about this, and have now returned to work. My maternity leave is over and I have to leave my daughter in nursery care. I can’t kiss her when I drop her off as I have to wear a mask. She cannot see the smiles of her nursery workers as they are in full PPE. I cannot step foot inside the nursery to see where my daughter spends her days. 

She is an IVF baby and so longed for. This experience is not what I wanted for her or for my family. We deserve more.
