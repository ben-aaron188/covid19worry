I am pleased my son gets to return to school on Monday. But for my eldest who is at University, I worry for his future job prospects. I don't think all the uK govt decisions have been logical and I am DESPERATE to go and play tennis again. I feel more hopeful than I did a month ago though because of vaccinations. I feel like the end is in sight. But I worry about the economic impact of Covid - we will be paying for some of our government's mistakes for a long time and I think there has been misuse of public finances.
