Frustrated that it’s not over. Angry that we got it so wrong in this country and have put money before lives. Worried that it’s still as contagious and deadly and worried that the vaccine won’t be the solution everyone is banking on. I feel sad that so many are still drying but because the numbers are lower they somehow count for less. Also the overall number is clearly higher but the figures have been swayed by the rules of what does or doesn’t count in the figures. If you die after 28 days of a positive test you aren’t classed as a death from Covid. This is insulting to the memory of loved ones lost.
