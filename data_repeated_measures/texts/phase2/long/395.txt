At the moment, I'm somewhat optimistic about England's situation regarding the pandemic. Millions of people have now been vaccinated against the virus and we're nearing the end of our third lockdown. I'm so pleased my children can now go back to school next week. I'm very hopeful our Covid cases and deaths will continue to decline and we'll soon all be able to carry on our lives as normal. I'm pleased with the way my community has dealt with this pandemic. I'm proud we have all pulled together to help one another out. I'm so excited to finally be able to soon visit family and friends.
