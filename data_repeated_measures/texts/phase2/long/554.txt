I feel positive that we are getting to the point where we are beating the virus but we still have a way to go. It is great that the vaccination program is happening at a great pace and I will take the opportunity to have it as soon as it is available for my age range. In my area the rate of infection is still higher than the national average which is concerning but it is slowly reducing. I feel that with the schools going back next week will be a test to see what will happen with the infection rate. I believe that it may rise and I feel that our children are being used as guinea pigs.
