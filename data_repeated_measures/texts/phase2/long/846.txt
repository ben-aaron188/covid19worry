On the one hand, I am really glad that the vaccination programme is going so well in the UK. But I'm unsure whether even slow re-opening will lead to sufficiently low cases. I am just unsure if I will ever experience a normal time at university again, it all just feels so distant.

I am also worried that my family in Germany will have to wait ages for vaccines, which will not help me feel good about visiting them. I haven't seen them for 7 months now, and I just want to hug them again. The high number of anti-vaccers also really worries me.
