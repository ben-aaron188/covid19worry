I'm feeling hopeful about the Corona situation in the UK right now - much of my immediate family has been vaccinated due to age or underlying health issues and I am less fearful now. I was terrified that something would happen to my parents who are in their sixties, or my eldest brother who is very immunocompromised but I am less stressed at this time. However, I am a recent graduate (during the pandemic) and I am struggling to find optimism at the moment about finding meaningful work I'm passionate about as I have been trying for months to little success. The market is awful and i have been unemployed for several months.
