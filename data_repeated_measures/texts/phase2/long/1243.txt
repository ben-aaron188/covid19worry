I think we are getting close to the moment when we will be back to a normal situation. The vaccine is having positive effects in a lot of countries around the world. I am still concerned about my parents because I donÂ´t want them to catch it before getting the vaccine. I think next year will be normal again. People will go on holidays and return to their places of work. Governments are making great efforts to help the countries economies. However the crisis when the virus is gone will be hard to solve.
