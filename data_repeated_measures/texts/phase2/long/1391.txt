I am worried that if i catch the virus i will pass it on to my husband who is very vulnerable. I worry about catching it at a supermarket or in a shop as you don't know who has touched what. It is uncomfortable being in a public place as a lot of people don't distance or wear their mask properly. We now have our shopping delivered but we have to collect our prescriptions from the pharmacy. I don't like queuing for the above reasons and because of weather conditions.

The good thing is that we have both had our first vaccine, so that does help us feel a bit more at ease. We both had the Astra Zeneca vaccine.
