At the every beginning of the crisis I had fears over whether or not the government was capable of handling the situation effectively, whether the people who were tasked with taking charge of the official response and protecting the population as much as possible would be up to the task. I liked to think that at the very least they would be able to make the most basic efforts of minimising transmission as much as possible
As I sit here almost a full year later having lived through the crisis as it unfolded, the overwhelming emotions I have right now are very much anger and disgust. I believe that the government had the information they needed about the potential issues that Covid could create, but at this point it's clear that they chose to ignore the people who were advising them and pursue a dangerous course of action that has resulted in one of the worst infection and death rates in the world. Inactivity at critical moments, conflicting information, late decisions and bad judgment all contributed to what has turned into what feels like a complete failure of governance.
Not only that, but they have actively used the crisis as a means to award lucrative Covid-related contracts to personal friends and associates, often without any service or materials coming back in exchange.
Now my greatest fear is that the amount of time between the first and second stages of the vaccinations - more time than recommended by the vaccine makers and industry experts - could potentially create the perfect environment for a resistant strain to develop, alongside the mutations we're seeing appear.
As a person who contracted a moderate Covid infection over Christmas I can confirm that this feels different to anything I have ever experienced before, and almost three months later I still have minor issues occasionally as a result. I believe that this could all have been avoided to a large extent, but for the decisions and actions of the very people who we trusted to make competent and wise choices on our behalf.
