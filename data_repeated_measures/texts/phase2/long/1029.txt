I'm excited about an increasingly more open country and to go out and do things that I haven't been able to in a long time. The relative isolation has been affecting me mentally more and more, especially as I can see the end now. I still have some small worries about new strains of the virus/how effective or how long the vaccine will be effective. I have some small worries about the economy of the country as well including how the transition back to in-person shopping will effect my employers business.
