In the country where I live the government have set out a plan for the next few months as to how we will ease out of lockdown which I feel is unrealistic. I am concerned about the potential uproar if the government does not stick to this but more concerned about another potential spike in cases if they do decide to go ahead with the plan. I do not believe the vaccine will be as effective as people are hoping - I am hopeful that it will bring us positive results and believe everyone should be vaccinated but I don't think it should mean we try to rush back to normal life too soon.
