i feel better about the virus than i did as i have now had my vaccination so feel better about it, where as before i was really anxious and worried about catching it as i have an underlying health condition,
i am still slightly worried about my family catching it , but not as much as they dont have any underlying conditions, so i,m feeling less anxious and worried about the virus than i was a few weeks ago
i also feel better and more relaxed about it now that more people have been vaccinated so there is less chance of catching it, and the numbers of people infected are going down every week.
