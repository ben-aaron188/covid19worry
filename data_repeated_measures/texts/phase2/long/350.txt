I am quite scared and anxious about the current coronavirus situation. I recently got my letter to shield. This was quite shocking as it means that I should have been shielding from March last year but I didn’t know.I am particularly worried because I live in a household with others who are not shielding.
I do understand that the government has been trying to deal with this issue and make the right decisions but it can’t be easy. My family is overseas and it means I can’t travel to see them.
My weight gain since in lockdown has also been a major cause for concern. I am hoping that things will ease soon so that I can return to taking daily walks without disruption.
I also have concerns for children and adults who have been locked in with their abusers. This must be difficult and I think about this a lot.
My other concern if for my neighbours and the atmosphere we live in.
