I feel anxious for my children and family. I know our life will not be the same as it was. People will always be sacred of this for much time to come. I feel disappointed that it got so bad and so many lives were lost. I do fear for my kid's future, if this was allowed to get so bad what could happen again? I worry about my daughter going back to school tomorrow, but she needs to go back as she's feeling frustrated with not being at school with her friends. I try to hide my anxieties with her. I want her to have the same carefree childhood I had.
