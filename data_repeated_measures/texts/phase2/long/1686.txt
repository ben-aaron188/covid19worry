I feel sad that I’m missing so much time and losing out on income and not being able to see family or travel. I miss going out for food with friends and family I miss going to stay at family’s house and I miss feeling optimistic for the future because Everything seems so bleak and depressing. I’m also angry at the government they haven’t done anywhere near enough they’ve been an absolute joke they could have done so much more than they have done they have been quite useless to be honest, I feel like I’ve lost who I am and I have no motivation to get out of bed in the mornings anymore I miss being able to just do what I want when I want to do it I miss going to the gym and I just feel sad overall not being able to do anything. I feel isolated and I feel trapped and I feel deflated all the time I don’t remember the last time I felt happy or optimistic about anytbing I feel easily irritable and anxious constantly as well.
