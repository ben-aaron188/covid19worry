I feel good now I believe the Government has a hold on the situation. Every person has had a different experience, some worse than mine. The be anxiety and fear that was caused may take some time to release. Now is a time to move on and move up in their lives. Invest in their families, their communities and the children who have suffered as they are our future.
A lot of elderly people don't know why we have been so scared of what wasn't the greatest pandemic in their lives and perspective has been missing from the response.
