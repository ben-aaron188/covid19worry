Grateful for my first dose of the vaccine.  I feel the lockdown is long.  I hope the collective efforts will end lockdown.  I am sad not to be able to be with my family for what is almost one year.  I hope I will be allowed to travel to the capital to be with them as soon as is permitted to do so.  I have been able to take a walk everyday, read most days and take a yoga exercise once a week.  Keeping myself occupied learning new skills. I feel I am getting impatient and with limited allowed activities, I am getting tired of the same routine and in need of more diverse activity.  My house is now cleaner than ever, thanks to limits to the activities I am allowed.
