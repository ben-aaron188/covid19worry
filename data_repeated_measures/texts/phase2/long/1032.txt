I feel that the situation has not improved in this country as the government seem to have no consistent plans in place. The only thing currently going to plan is vaccinations. I feel somewhat less anxious knowing that a vaccine is being given out, however I am still highly concerned about catching Covid. I feel as though the current lockdown situation will be repeated in the coming months, as children are going back to school tomorrow, thus spreading the virus again. The re-opening of pubs is also a sure fire way of spreading the virus quickly.
