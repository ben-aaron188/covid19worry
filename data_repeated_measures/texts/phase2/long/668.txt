I have lost hope at this point. At the beginning I was hopeful but now this pandemic just seems endless and I can’t imagine having my old life and freedoms back atm for another year at least. I am sad that what I thought would be a short isolation has escalated. I feel the UK government could’ve done more to protect us by closing borders like new zealand or australia and we could have had more freedom and our lives back by now. I only hope the vaccines will help us to get back to more normality as I am very hopeless at the moment and have lost all motivation.
