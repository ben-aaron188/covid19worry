I feel generally hopeful that things are improving in the Uk. However my anxiety comes from the fact that I am acutely aware that this is a global issue and that the coronavirus situation elsewhere could very quickly affect the improved situation we have here. The rising cases in Europe are worrying. I am also concerned for poorer countries with densely populated poor districts where basic health precautions are challenging. This makes me both sad and anxious. I can't take full pleasure in our improving situation here whilst others are still suffering.  I feel that the situation is precarious and so I don't feel that I can take full pleasure in the situation improving as I feel it could quickly go backwards as it did last year. I appreciate that we now have vaccines but the global vaccine supply is a major issue as is the ability of the virus to mutate. I think we should appreciate and make the most of the increased freedoms we will shortly be getting in UK whilst still being aware that we are a long way from this pandemic being over yet and that these freedoms may be curtailed again.
