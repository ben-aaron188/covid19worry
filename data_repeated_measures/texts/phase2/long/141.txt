i've just had the first vaccine jab, so am part of the growing numbers in the UK that are now a little bit safer. I'm still concerned about the others who have yet to receive the jab, or who are out of work or on furlough because of the virus though. I just hope that we are past the worst, and are on the road back to 'normality' whatever that is these days. I also wonder about the rest of the world, and how far they are on way out of this. I'm definetly looking forward to being able to move freely both day to day, and also on holidays etc.
