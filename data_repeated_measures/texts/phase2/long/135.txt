I think there is light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccination programme but wish people would continue to obey social distancing rules in the meantime.  The gradual release of lockdown is a good thing as it gives time for more people to get the vaccination. I feel less worried about catching coronavirus now than I did before as the treatments are better.  I have had my first vaccination but continue to social distance.  I am less concerned about my daughter going back to school now that I know that testing will happen.
