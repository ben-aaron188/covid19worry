The situation seems positive compared to other times. The vaccine has given hope to many. I hope the coming months show a big decrease in cases and a positive end to the pandemic. I feel positive and have ambitions I want to achieve over the coming  months. The pandemic has brought about changes in people's lives, a number of these changes are for the better for many people's lives. This may never have happened if it wasn't for the pandemic or the changes may have come much later. It has been a long year and nearly the one year anniversary of the start of the first lockdown. What a crazy year it's been. We have come a long way and I'd like for this lock down to be the very last, with no going back.
