I am completely sick of it and am bored of my life. Lockdown brings no joy at all and it’s hard to plan anything and look forward to anything so I am just existing. The threat level is going down thank god and I am happy so many people have been vaccinated so far, I am nervous about getting my jab but will be arranging it as soon as I am called as I want to visit my brother in America.  I think there have been such a wide range of lockdown interpretations that have kept this whole thing going longer than it should have done and I just want to to move on now and get my life back. The government have dealt with it the best they could but it’s all been a mess regardless.
