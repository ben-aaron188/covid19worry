I feel relaxed as there is now an end in-sight due to vaccinations being rolled-out to the general population. I also feel relieved that we can all look forward to a return to normal life. I do feel that we can learn alot from the past year and that we will all become stronger as a result. Everyone will become more aware of the dangers aroud them.
