I’m currently feeling cross that I’m not able to go to work and help my friends who are having to deal with the ever changing back to school issues because I’m shielding again. I feel useless when I’m as healthy as I normally am and am just sat at home when I could easily be helping them. Because I live in such a small village I’m more confident in how I can live safely around here, just hard that I don’t really know when I’m allowed out again! I am ready just to be able to see my family again, thankful to be able to bubble and have the support of friends that I didn’t have at the beginning of lockdown one so I don’t feel as lonely as I did then, glad to have friends and a community to support me.
