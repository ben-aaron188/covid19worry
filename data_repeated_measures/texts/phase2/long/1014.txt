Overall I feel a lot of anger about all the avoidable mistakes that have been made, particularly in the so-called ""second wave"". I am both cautiously optimistic based on the rapidly falling numbers in the UK and the fast vaccine rollout, and also anxious that the tide may turn yet again if precautions are relaxed too quickly and/or vaccine-evading mutations begin to spread. I am lonely and isolated, and in particular I feel a more complex sort of anxiety about when I can see my parents again as they live abroad and also have somewhat antivaccine-leaning views so I may not feel safe visiting them even after it would be possible/legal again.
