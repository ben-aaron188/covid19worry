I am angry at the government for treating the NHS staff so badly. I am far more relaxed about the threat from the virus. The vaccines seem safe but so did Thalidomide so perhaps I should be a little more worried.

tHE VIRUS CAN MUTATE SO THAT IS A WORRY. i HAVE HAD IT AND IT IS NOT VERY MUCH FUN. tHE COUGH WAS EXHAUSTING BUT THE BREAthlessness was worse. I would not wish it on my worst enemy although for Boris Johnson I'd make an exception.

I sincerely hope that we will be rid of the virus but really fear that the more we invade habitats which could be hiding far more deadly viruses and other things than Covid the more we risk widespread infections and possible annhilation of mankind.
