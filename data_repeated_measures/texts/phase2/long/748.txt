I'm so annoyed as a healthy young person who won't be offered the vaccine till July that passport's may be introduced to stop me a healthy person doing things because I won't be offered the vaccine because I'm healthy. I find it frustrating I've stayed in all this time to protect older more vulnerable people to now be almost punished. To me it makes absolutely no sense and is likely to just annoy people who are similar age and situation to myself. But to voice this opinion is called selfish which equally annoys me.
