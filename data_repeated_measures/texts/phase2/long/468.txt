I feel pissed off that the Government has shown such poor leadership throughout this pandemic. I feel pissed off that they’ve wasted billions of pounds on ineffective PPE but then can only manage to give the NHS a measly 1% pay rise after everything they have so selflessly done. I feel pissed off that I’m a Teacher and now have to go into school without being vaccinated when other countries are putting their Teachers first. I don’t understand why they couldn’t have gradually brought the children back to school in stages rather than all at once. I don’t understand why the test and trace system was so badly managed and  executed. I really think this government need to go.
