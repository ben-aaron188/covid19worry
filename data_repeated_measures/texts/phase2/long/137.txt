I feel okay about everything at the moment because the vaccine rollout feels like we are finally coming close to the end of it. I am hopeful that things will be back to normal this year even if it isn't end of June like the roadmap is aiming for. I can't wait to get my vaccination and to see people, do nice things and go on holiday again. Even the thought of being able to have people round in the garden as the weather starts getting warmer at the moment is lovely and I'm excited to just get a little bit of normality back with that and then the gym and shops opening in the next month or so.
