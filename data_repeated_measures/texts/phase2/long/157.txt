Having spent the best part of the year feeling very worried and scared of catching coronavirus and potentially becoming very ill I am now feeling much safer as I have had my first vaccine dose, as have the other adults in my immediate family.  I am still concerned about the future and particularly the effect on my two children of having missed so much time at school.  I have also been out of the house so rarely I am not sure I know how to do normal things anymore like go shopping. I am fortunate not to have suffered the loss of anyone close to me or ant great financial difficulties.
