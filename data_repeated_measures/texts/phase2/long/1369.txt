I feel that its sadly gone on for too long shot he economical aspect is ruined as well as peoples mental health. If the giv locked down sooner this would have been avoided. I have had covid, and a lot of my friends have had covid and as worrying as it may seem I believe the media is scaremongering and making people scared and worried. I am not saying its jot real because it certainly is, but i think personally the government are blaming this on the public to hide the fact they know they messed up from the start
