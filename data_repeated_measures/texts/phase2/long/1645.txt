I feel relaxed about the current situation, It's been a difficult period over the last few months especially. Now with the vaccine rollout in full swing things are looking brighter knowing we can have a road map in action knowing better times are ahead. It's also positive that the case rates have fallen drastically to more lower levels. The one big concern is the threat of new variants which could hinder all long term effects of the vaccine rollout. The variants from South Africa were a concern
