Im still very worried, even though there is a light in the tunnel -vaccnes. However people are lured into a false security and think everything is ok and its over but it isnt. Im still super careful and obery all the rules and restrctions, wwaiting for my turn to be vaccinated, which will probaby happen in a couple of months. We will be safe when majority is vaccinated and not only n ths country but in the whole world. We live in a global village, traveling all the time, so a chance to spread the virus will still be there .
