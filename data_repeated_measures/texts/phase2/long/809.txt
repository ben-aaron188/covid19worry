I feel. Sadness at not being able to see or spend time with my family. My children are growing up and my.parents and grand parents aren't able to share in this joy properly. My. Grandparents are 80 years old and I feel we are missing out spending quality time with them. I crave spending time with my own niece and nephew and feel. Our relationships have suffered. I miss seeing them and arranging time with them. I also miss spending time with friends and even when we arrange to do something it is very limited as there is nothing open. I do however feel a happiness with my own children and feel that we have bonded further and appreciate the time we have had together to create a deep bond.
