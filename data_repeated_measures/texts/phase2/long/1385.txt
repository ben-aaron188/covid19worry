I feel sad about everything weâ€™ve missed out on over the last year but hopeful that things will get better soon and that we will be able to see our friends, family and loved ones again. I also feel sad for those that have lost loved ones during this pandemic. I feel angry at the way the government has handled the situation and how it is now treating NHS staff so badly. I am worried about the new strains of Coronavirus being introduced (e.g. the Brazillian strain) and the vaccines not working against them.
