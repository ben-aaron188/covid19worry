Im ready to receive the vaccine and be allowed to lead a normal life. the government has handled the situation horribly. 

I look forward to being able to go outside, generally im over the situation but being on lockdown has saved me money but i do miss being around my friends even just going to one another's homes.

I do wish others wouldn't break rules to make it easier for us to transition out of lockdown quickly 

I feel a little frustration as my best years are passing me by i entered the pandemic at 23 and i will hopefully be leaving at 25 wow look how fast time has gone
