I feel like this third lockdown has been the toughest. Four weeks for the second was quite hard to get my head around, especially at the beginning. But now that we've come so far through the third, and things are starting to look more positive, I'm being kept going by the hope that in a few weeks I'll be able to start doing the things I've been missing so much. So I'm very excited about that--but it's of course mixed with some sadness over the whole experience for everyone, the trials we've all had to face, some of course more than others. Also, can I really believe that everything will be open and back to normal by 21st June? Maybe it will, but I can't of course be too sure. So in short my feelings are mixed, although slightly leaning towards the more positive side of things.
