At the moments I'm worried for the arts. Part of my money comes from performing and COVID has ripped through this industry. I miss playing music with my friends- that was always a great part of what I did.  I miss travel and seeing international friends. I used to attend around 2 international academic conferences per year. I don't know when this will return. Uncertainty is hard. My career was going well before COVID. Its almost been on hold for a year and the world has changed and will keep changing. Its important to fins a new place in the world but it will be hard as it looks like we are heading for more austerity.
