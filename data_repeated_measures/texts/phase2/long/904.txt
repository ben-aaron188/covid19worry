Given the current situation with the vaccine provision to vulnerable people, I just want to be able to get on with normal life. I feel like I've aged a year and my life is no richer for it. I want my family to meet our new baby, eat out, go to the cinema, etc. I also want to be able to plan to visit parts of the world that excite me without fear of lost money due to cancellations. There's also the concern that even when these options are available again, if restrictions aren't eased they still won't be enjoyable. I just want to get vaccinated and get on with life.
