I'm tired and fed up of the unknowns. I feel some hope that things will get better but weary of close family members always focusing on the negatives and fear and predicting doom at every turn. Personally, I believe we are on the up and looking forward to getting out and about more and some semblance of new routines back this summer. I have some anxiety about that, especially as someone with mental health conditions who has just managed to get a long-standing eating disorder under control through a pretty robust routine of meal times and order to my day. I am a bit concerned about going back to a tiring commute too. I am worried for the economy for the long-term and believe we will be paying for the virus for decades, and that those who have continued to work throughout will not necessarily benefit.
