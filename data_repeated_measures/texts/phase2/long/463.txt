I still feel anxiety at the current time. I will be happier once I have had my second vaccine shot. My anxiety is lower than it was a few months back and I see light at the end of the tunnel now. I worry about my friends and family both in terms of their physical and mental health. I am looking forward to seeing my friends again in the not too distant future and being able to attend sporting events once again. I worry still when I have to take public transport or visit the supermarket but have been washing my hands in the correct manner and taking the appropriate precautions to try and reduce my chances of infection even further and will continue to do so until advised otherwise.
