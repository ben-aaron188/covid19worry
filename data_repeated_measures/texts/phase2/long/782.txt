I feel that we are getting to a good place with the successful vaccination programme. When I look back at the previous year, I feel very angry about the incompetence of the government in dealing with the situation. However, it does seem that lessons have been learned all of a sudden, so I do have confidence in the handling of the situation at this moment. 
I am very much looking forward to life becoming more interesting over the next few months. I have missed days out and trips to pubs and restaurants. 
I think I have reached the stage of lockdown fatigue now. The fear element has gone for me personally as I know I am not in a vulnerable group. Although there is a chance I could get it and die, this could also happen when I cross the road.
The main concern for me is whether it's safe to use the tube when my office is open.
