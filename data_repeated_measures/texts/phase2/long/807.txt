I am anxious at to the future and worried yet excited about what comes next. Looking forward to seeing people and yet also nervous about seeing them after itâ€™s been so long. 

I am also feeling angry and frustrated about the people not following the rules and causing major issues for the rest of us, and putting pressure in the NHS who are working ridiculous hard. Especially when I am awaiting healthcare myself for a diagnosis and I am delayed due to covid. 

I hope that there is soon light at the end of a tunnel and this will all be a distant memory especially now more people are vaccinated. I had mine yesterday and feeling positive about it :)
