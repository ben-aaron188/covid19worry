At the moment I feel quite optimistic about the Corona situation with the news that the figures show the vaccine is working well. I feel quite hopeful for the future and that life will feel a little more 'normal' soon. I am eager to start making plans for myself and my family to have days out and enjoy life again. I'm feeling a little anxious at the same time as I am worried that we might have to endure more lockdowns and restrictions if the figures start going in the wrong direction again. I do feel that life will return to normal but I think this may take longer than we all hope.
