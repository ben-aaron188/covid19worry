Fed up, restricted and bored. It's been going on too long. We are an Island and we should have locked down in the beginning to prevent it spreading. Lockdown should have been stricter as people don't take proper notice and penalties larger. NHS staff feel let down. All the work they have done has been thrown back in their faces. Instead of people on universal credit being given a pay rise for sitting on their arses for a year, it should have been given to those on the front line, risking their lives. Now I do feel angry.
