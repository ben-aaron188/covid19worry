I am content with my life currently. The way I see things: there things I can control and things I cannot (e.g. lockdown rules preventing socialising etc) therefore anything that I can control I make an active change and for the things I cannot control I therefore don't worry about it. I feel my university course has become slightly easier and more ""life friendly"" as now I don't have to commute as much and more teaching is done remotely. Regarding my job during the start of COVID19 I was working more than ever and making more money :)
