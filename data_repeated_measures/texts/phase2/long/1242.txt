I think I feel a lot more hopeful this year with the vaccine, and I hope this can be eradicated so we can go back to living a normal life. I do still fear people are not taking it seriously and are putting everyone at risk by not following guidelines. I’m very angry about this as we could have been out of this a lot sooner as we are an island and there is absolutely no reason it should have gotten as bad as it has. I am thankful that my friends a d family are safe, and pray to God we all remain safe and make it through this. This has been an incredibly difficult time and I have severely suffered mentally and I do think more needs to be done with regards to help the physical and mental health of everyone coming out of this. I am very upset I couldn’t hug my cousins as we buried their mother, I’m very upset I haven’t been able to see my friends in over a year, and mostly I’m distressed as it doesn’t seem to end because the government are incapable of making timely decisions.
