I am not exactly sure whether I still have feelings about it. Overall, I feel apathy and disappointment with the way the UK handled this situation. I feel helpless that I cannot do what I want, although I have followed all the rules and was very cautious. It makes me slightly proud of myself but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter. I feel quite miserable because I have lose one year of my life and I resent people more. I still don't want to catch covid but more out of a principle rather than fear. For some reason I am l much less worried about my parents getting it, I just don't think about. Time doesn't feel real any more and it is hard to stay motivated.
