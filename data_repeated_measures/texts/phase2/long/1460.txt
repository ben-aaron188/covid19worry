I feel that if everyone follows the rules we would be able to reduce the infection rate and get through it faster. If we keep going into lockdown and then out of lockdown without major progress the situation isnâ€™t going to get better anytime soon. I feel that some people are not taking it seriously and this is causing it to get worse and I feel that everyone will need the vaccine before it gets better. I feel worried when going out due to the pandemic and working from home can make certain jobs difficult.
