I feel calm. I am continue to follow the current government guidelines to protect myself, my family and the NHS. The rollout of the vaccine gives hope but we must still be cautious and not think that everything will go back to normal. I am still working from home and will ask my employer if I can continue to do this on a permanent basis. I enjoy working from home and do not miss the daily commute. I miss seeing my friends and general social activity and going on vacation but these are necessary sacrifices to stop the spread of Covid 19. I have no problem wearing a mask in public, again I feel this is my moral obligation to do my part. I think people that refuse to wear a mask are selfish.
