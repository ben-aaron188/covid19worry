I feel sad that it has taken so long to get the situation under control, but hopeful that the vaccine rollout will bring a long term solution.  However there is mistrust at the government and I hope that they do not make more fundamental errors in the delivery of this essential issue.  Overall I am fortunate that the toll of the pandemic is only emotional - lost time but not health or friends/family.  This will pass with new memories and opportunities once life returns to normal.  The only question is how much longer it will be now that there are some green shoots visible.  With the longer days and warmer weather the sense of hope is increasing.
