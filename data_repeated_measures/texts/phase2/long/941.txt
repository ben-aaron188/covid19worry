I'm just tired of it all. I feel like I'm running a marathon I never wanted to sign up for. My son is now 17 months and I want to enjoy motherhood with him. I want to go swimming and feel fit and attractive and be a romantic partner to my husband and not his roommate who never leaves. I feel quite run down. I'm tired of listening to Boris Johnson. I want to live again and go out for a nice meal. I want my parents to meet my son. I feel like I'm a blinking cursor -- just waiting around to write something instead of sitting in a blank page.
