I feel angry about how the pandemic has been handled and the response of the public and the attitude towards it. This is in relation to not following guidelines, poor government help and conspiracy theories about vaccines. I am fed up of hearing about it on the news all the time. I am looking forward to 21st of June when things reopen again as the date is symbolic of hope. But I am also vary of the impact of new strains of covid that keep emerging as we do not know the impact it will have on the current vaccines and how effective they are against the new strains. Also as a student I feel anxious at my job prospects after graduation giving the awful state of the economy and poor budget for the next year.
