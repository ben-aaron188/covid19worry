I would like for normal life to resume as I miss having my freedom and the ability to go where I want to. I am not too worried about catching coronavirus as I was last year. Myself and many people I know are covid weary and want the lockdowns to stop. I am angry at how this pandemic has been dealt with such as being told not to wear masks and then it being made mandatory. I feel worried about my children and their education, as well as their futures and having to pay pay back the national debt this has caused. I am unsure about the vaccine at the moment and dislike feeling pressured to take it.
