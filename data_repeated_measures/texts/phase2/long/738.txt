At the moment I am finding the Covid 19 somewhat confusing, at any given moment things can change very suddenly - I can't keep up with the guidance. The fact that the vaccine is now being rolled out is definitely a positive thing and I am looking forward to having mine. The situation is boring now on a day to day basis but it is important that we all stick to the guidelines and gradually things will go back to normal even if this does take a while. I truly am so grateful for the hard work and unrelenting passion of the NHS and the dedicated staff who look after us day in day out - together we will beat this!
