I am concerned about the virus but am less anxious than before as have gotten used to living with the risk. I will be glad when I get the vaccine so I can visit family but I don't want to go back to the office as I prefer working from home. I hope we can continue to stay safe and healthy until the danger has passed/reduced. I like having more time at home with my partner and our dog, and having more time to read and less time shopping/commuting. I do miss travelling and seeing friends though. Not sure what else I can add here.
