I feel much better now, considering all the vaccinations that are taking place so less fear and anxiety towards the risk of getting the virus, but still feel sadness to the people who died unnecessarily from it because of how the whole situation was poorly handled and slightly angry towards it how it was all handled. I am feeling grateful that corona did not affect me or my family and we were fortunate enough to get the vaccines. Also feeling grateful for the essential workers who put there lives on the line.
