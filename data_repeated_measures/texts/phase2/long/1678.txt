Glad everything is getting better, my family members are getting vaccinated and things are getting back to normal, though i feel mentally affected from the long run of being stuck indoors, I can take it upon myself to finally start fixing my life, i got through college despite everything and it all seems to be ok, however i still am cautious for the future as we have no idea how things are going to be by the time June 21st rolls around, Just a few more cautious steps towards the end for life to get better again.
