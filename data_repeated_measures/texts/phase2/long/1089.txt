I am hopeful things in the UK are improving but worried the Westminster Govt will open up activity too soon. Worldwide, too many people are travelling already and some countries are way behind in their vaccination programmes. Overall I am concerned that we are seeing a false dawn with another bad wave of deaths to come, especially with new variants. Some people still don't get it and are acting irresponsibly. This virus has not finished with us yet. It seems to be a very adaptable virus and will have a few more changes up its sleeve yet. I am cautious about starting to move about more freely yet.
