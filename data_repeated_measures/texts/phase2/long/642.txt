I think we are at the end of the coronavirus situation with the help of the vaccines. I don't think covid changed my lifestyle much to begin with and I feel somewhat the same as I did before the lockdown. I think we will start seeing more antivax posts on social media now that younger generations are getting vaccinated. I think more people will want to work from home now that they know that they can. I feel like outbreaks are going to occur more often considering climate change isn't taken seriously as of yet.
