At the moment i am really happy that a lot of people have now recieved their first covid jab including myself, partner and friends.Sad that people are still dying of covid but hopeful that everyone will get the first covid jab soon.Annoyed that some people still say covid is not true and social media companies still allow them to post false information on their sites.Upset that many people are still waiting for life changing operations with the national health service.Concerned that itis going to take many years for the poorest countries to recieve their vaccine due to the rich countries buying up the worlds supply
