Very confused, we are supposed to be in lockdown but every one is going about their usual lives, nurses have been kicked in the teeth by Boris, sick to the pit of my stomach about the self servatives. The jab is giving people hope but is there really hope, will everyone be vaccinated, will people go on holiday and risk new strains, will the jab actually keep us safe, will it stop us transmitting the virus, getting the virus, is there really a possibility that life will return to normal? For me no, the world has changed irrevocably
