I am feeling Generally okay about covid 19 situation, I feel that there's light at the end of the tunnel now people are getting there vaccinations and roadmap is out there so people know the plan. Feeling optimistic that life will return to normal soon. I hope it does because I am sick of the whole thing massively. Look forward to being back to normal. I don't really have much more to say about it all. Wish it was over and feel sad for those who have lost life's and their families.
