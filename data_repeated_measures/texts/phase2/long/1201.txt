I'm feeling optimistic. People are receiving vaccinations at a rapid rate and the end to lockdown is approaching. The number of infections and deaths are decreasing also. Hopefully this takes the strain off of the NHS. The doctors and nurses and frontline workers deserve a break. But I'm also wary that if people let their guards down we'll be back to square one. I'm worried about the impact covid has had on the economy in the long term. People are going to find it hard to get back into any form of employment
