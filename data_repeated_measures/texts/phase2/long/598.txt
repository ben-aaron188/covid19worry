At the moment I feel confident that things may return to a somewhat ""normal"" state.

Vaccines have been pushed out for sometime with good up take, the number of cases being reported is going down although we have been in lockdown since just before Christmas. This looks to be ending somewhat at the end of March enabling people to meet, and then pretty much all restrictions lifted by june.

WHO today announced case increases in Central and Eastern europe. I think the worst thing that could happen going forward is either new variants of the virus popping up that are resistant against the vaccines. Or long term data proving the vaccines arent as useful as first thought. 

While I support the UK governments action taken. i.e lockdowns, a year later not being able to do basic things, when I want to do them is now tiresome.
