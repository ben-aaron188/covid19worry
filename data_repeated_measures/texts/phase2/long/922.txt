I am still concerned about the coronavirus even though there’s now a vaccine,I think that people will be too relaxed about social distancing when we come out of lockdown and it could lead to infection rates rising again. I hope I’m wrong about this.Different variants also worry me in case the vaccine doesn’t work against them, I also think travelling abroad should be seriously thought about as it could bring infection back into Britain. I think lockdown has been very hard on some people,especially children and we need to get schools open as soon as possible but not to the detriment of the rest of society.
