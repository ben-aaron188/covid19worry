I have always suffered from health anxiety, so this pandemic has been really hard. I caught covid in Oct which wasn’t pleasant but actually relieved the anxiety a bit. 
Right now it feels like things are getting a lot better with new cases and deaths coming down and quick vaccine rollout. The main thing that worries me is the new variants in case the vaccines aren’t effective. I am also concerned we are easing lockdown too early and everyone that hasn’t been vaccinated yet means it will just spread like wildfire.
