I am increasingly anxious as the economy begins to reopen, and with new variants, I worry about a 3rd spike, as seems to be starting elsewhere in Europe. I think the vaccine will obviously help, but there's not enough evidence to support how effective it can be to the new variants in my opinion and I think people that get the vaccine could become more reckless and start to waver from the rules and restrictions. With parts of France currently about to go into another lockdown, and with summer approaching, I fear winter could return to parts of the country and economy being locked back down again
