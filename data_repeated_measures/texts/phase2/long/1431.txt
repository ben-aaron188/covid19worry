I feel worried and anxious that we are a year into this pandemic and are still living under lockdown restrictions. When will it end? When will the vaccines be rolled out enough to become effective? Why are people not listening to rules and continuing to put others at risk?

I am missing friends and family and want nothing more than to spend time with them, indoors and able to hug, however I am worried about being a carrier and passing on the virus to vulnerable family members.

However, I have learned a lot about myself and have had to find other ways of coping so right now I am grateful for being able to relax more than usual and have time to focus on myself.
