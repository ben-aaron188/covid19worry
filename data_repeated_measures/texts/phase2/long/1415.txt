This corona situation really hasn’t affected me mentally. My children still went to school as they usually did before COVID it really didn’t affect my day to day or my financial situation as I’m able to work from home and also able to pick up my children as I usually did from school.

The only thing I would say is that I’m really not sure on whether I would take that risk and book a holiday for me and the kids as I have not yet had to vaccine and wouldn’t want to put myself into a situation that have been avoided if I had just been abit more patient.
