Fatigued, tired, defeated, deflated and disgruntled. I just want to wake up from this bad and too long nightmare. I want to travel again and get some sort of stability and purpose in life. Now I am on standby for redundancy, self esteem collapse and depression. Just counting days for all these bad things to happen and this is on a fairly nice even slightly sunny day. When you have just a few years of your life left and every minute counts, so many unticked bucket list items are still there, the last thing you want is the lockdown inertia.
