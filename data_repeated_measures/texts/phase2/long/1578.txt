I feel that the situation has been handled very badly. Even in Jan 2020, I knew that I should make my priority the wearing of a mask, and the need for social distancing. In Feb I was wearing a mask when travelling on the train. At first we were told categorically that we shouldn't be wearing a mask. Even those with a modicum of common sense would realise that wearing a mask would protect one from aerosol transmission. I feel that the mask instructions will end up being the big scandal of the pandemic.
