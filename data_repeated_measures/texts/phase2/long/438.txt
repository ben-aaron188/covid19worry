It is a concern for many people all over the world but we seem to be past the peak now that the vaccine process is well on the way. I wash my hands regularly and tey my best to keep 2 meters away from people at all times, so that is all I can really do to keep safe. I also strictly follow the UK governments advice and guidlines on the Covid-19 situation and check the news every day for any updates on the matter. I wish America would have taken the situation more seriously from the start, which would then have resulted in much less deaths for them.
