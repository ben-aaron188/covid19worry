I'm mostly angry as it seems that people and sometimes governements still haven't understood the situation fully. I feel frustrated as I'm complying with all guidance and far from my family, while other people just don't bother. I'm also hopeful vaccines will help, but worried people who may need them may still have to wait for a long time. I don't know when this will end and I'm anxious about this.
Luckily I found some balance in my life but I'd be so happy to be back to the office after one year.
