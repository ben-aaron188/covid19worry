Fed up with the UK's situation, even though everyone is claiming its the beginning of the end of the situation i dont think it will be. Im angry at how so many people at sticking to the rules at all and making the situation worse, and im sad for losing out on so many experiences i wont ever get to have now. Im also sad for the key workers who are not being treated properly. Im apprenhensive about my future, there arent many opportunities to get a job as a graduate in my field now, i want to move out but that doesnt seem like, im angry that my life should be starting but its not.
