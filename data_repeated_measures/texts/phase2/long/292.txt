I feel like the current existing strains of it are beginning to be under control, and we can almost begin to relax, but we don't know what the future holds. I am quite sure that some worse disease will come along, whether a coronavirus variant or something new, and another frightening pandemic will be upon us then, probably one much more scary and deadly. The most disturbing part is that while we can prepare the practicalities like PPE and organisational work, we can't prepare for the unknown, the illness itself. And some people have been incredibly selfish and never even cared about minimising the transmission of this disease so they'll probably be just as cavalier next time.
