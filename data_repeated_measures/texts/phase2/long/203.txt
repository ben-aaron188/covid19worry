I am still worried about the coronavirus situation. However I feel that as vaccinations progress, things will ease somewhat. I just hope that new variants and strains don't change the situation though.

I also wonder when the coronavirus lockdowns will end, as I imagine many people, including myself, wish to go back to some semblance of normal.

Finally I'd say that I do worry a little about my elderly father. Even though he has had his first COVID vaccine dose, he may still be vulnerable, especially as he has lung issues.
