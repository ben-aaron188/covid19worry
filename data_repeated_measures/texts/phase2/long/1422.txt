While I am hopeful about the ongoing vaccination program I feel very defeated and hopeless about the pandemic globally, and frustrated by people's attitudes and selfishness. I miss my friends and family but my fear of catching or transmitting the virus is keeping me being very careful and staying at home. I feel anxious about the future of the planet, not so much for my own situation but the world in general, poverty, inequality and politics. I'm generally quite an optimistic person but lately I have been feeling very worn down.
