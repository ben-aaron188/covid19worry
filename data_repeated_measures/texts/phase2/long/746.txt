Hopeful. The rollout of vaccines is just about the only thing that the government has managed well. And the vaccines seems to be effective. Still lots of questions to answer (effect of end of lockdown, length of immunity, ...), but certainly hopeful that life will return to somewhat normal soonish. I expect that there will be ongoing changes, perhaps social distancing will be needed for a long time, perhaps we'll all have to have regular vaccinations. But looking forward to being able to visit friends and family, to going to pubs and restaurants,  to going to theatres and art galleries. Overall, hopeful.
