Frustrated at how slow things are and how we have had to endure this prolonged period of lockdown. Very frustrated at how all UK governments, but especially the Scottish, have taken a frankly authoritarian outlook and without any real scutiny done what they want. Hugely disappointed in the media and how they have been active in stifling any debate no matter how hypocritical this has shown them to be and how classist they are. The majority of people have been great and understood keep clean and keep your distance. Really pleased to see that the old folk have been the ones to flount the rules. They seem to realise that life is for living, not just existing. Hpefully after some reflection we will end up with a society that respects living your life more than looking for how to polish the I am a victim medals.
