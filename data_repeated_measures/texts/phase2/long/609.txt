Fed up of nothingness there is nothing to do how much longer can this situation go on for its soul destroying and boring 

I want to make travel plans I wnat to go back to a normal life but no always restrictions and fear this is really negative 

I wnat to be able to travel to the next town for walks and go places not stuck in this miserable place 

People should have stayed at home and being given harsher punishment for breaking rules as sometimes it feels like there wasnâ€™t a lockdown At all and people just been spreading this and making this lockdown seem like such an afterbirth
