A bit fatigued by it all now and hoping it will all end soon. 
It is getting a bit tiresome now and I do wish things would get back to normal. However, I am worried whether we will ever truly get back to normal. I think the whole pandemic has meant people's priorities have changed significantly. I am still working from home but do feel that work has invaded home life. I have put better steps in place to look after my mental health. On the good side being there with my family and getting to school runs and not having to take the tube has been a god send. I don't miss the commute at all.
