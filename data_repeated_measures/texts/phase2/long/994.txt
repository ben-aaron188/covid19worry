I’m really fed up with lockdown and people not adhering to the rules. I haven’t been able to work and am on furlough and every day is just the same boring day. I miss social interaction with people and even my alone time when I am travelling to and from work. Everything just blurs into one and it’s hard to get up and do the things you want to do  There’s nothing to look forward to because people are selfish and just can’t help themselves. I just can’t wait for this all to be over and get vaccinated so we can get out of lockdown and back to normal lives.
