There is a feeling of things being out of control, of not having agency, of feeling under pressure. Anger at facts being misrepresented by the media. It's got to the stage now where I rarely listen to the news any more I can't keep up with all the latest edicts and advice. I suppose fatigue about sums it up in a word. Also worry about authorities being given powers which they seem keen to abuse, stopping people as they go about their daily business. And employers also contributing to the snooper culture, checking employees temperatures, etc. Talk of theatres not allowing people in unless they have a certificate of vaccination. All these things are deeply worrying and you wonder if or when these powers will be rescinded, or will life be like this from now on.
