I'll be anxious until all of my family and friends are fully vaccinated I think. My parents have had their first jab which helps a lot but I'm still terrified that I could catch it and pass it to them. If they died I'd never forgive myself. I'm angry about how appallingly the government have handled this, giving contracts to their Tory friends instead of companies who can actually do the job. I'd quite like Boris to be strung up by his testes until he at least gives nurses a proper pay rise, and I haven't failed to notice that the day the restrictions fully end - June 21st - is Boris's birthday. So I think rather than listening to scientists he just decided he wanted to go and be a drunken weasel on his birthday.
