I feel that now we are being vaccinated, that we really need to be getting on with our lives. There is talk about a possible third wave but I worry about the businesses that will totally go under and I also worry about many peoples' mental health. I feel that it is very positive that we can now have the vaccine (had mine last night) and that we need to use that to forge ahead and definitely start opening places up again on the dates the government have already mentioned. I miss meeting my friends and I can't help that feel that everyone will have permanently been affected, not just from the fact many people will have lost loved ones, but also mentally, through the distress the whole thing has caused. It also feels like longer than a year that it has been going on and I long for some normality, more than I can ever express. Sorry this is so long but my feelings about this are very strong, as no doubt many peoples' will be.
