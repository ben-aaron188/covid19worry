Things are hopefully getting better and we can get back to normal soon. but there are still risks in doing that and i feel hopefulful but scared at the same time. the vaccines are being rolled out now which is good and everyone is getting thiers. I hope i get mine soon but i understand why it may be awhile. I hope we dont go into another lockdown once this one is done, but i don't think we will with all the vaccines being given out. The hope is things will be back to normal by the end of the year and we wont have to worry about it any more or have to wear masks
