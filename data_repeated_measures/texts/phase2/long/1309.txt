I feel its gotten a lot better esp with the vaccine rollout. but i also feel lie another wave is inevitable because corona will never go away so i feel we just need to start learning how to live with it and once the vaccine rollout has been given to everyone (or at least most people), then we should just carry on with life. i am a lot less anxious though and i feel im less scared to leave the house. i feel everything starting up again. the only thing i am worried about now is post corona life such as the employment market
