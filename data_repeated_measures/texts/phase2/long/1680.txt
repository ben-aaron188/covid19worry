I am hopeful as I think the vaccine will lead to us regaining some normality. I am also frustrated, and getting increasingly impatient about not being able to go out and do things I enjoy - it feels like it has been so long now and I am wasting time. I am completely unmotivated to do things I used to enjoy. I feel like I am struggling to be present as I am constantly thinking about things I can do and want to do in the future when lockdown has ended and Corona does not dominate day-to-day life. I hope that some of the positive changes we have seen in terms of a work-life balance will remain in place after Corona. I will not take the things I used to do before Corona for granted in the future.
