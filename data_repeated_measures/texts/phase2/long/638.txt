Frustrated that a year on, we seem to be in the same position we were back then. Hopeful that it will all be over by the end of the year thanks to the vaccines. But anxious that it won't be enough and things will never return to normal. Because of all the above, I have a rush of mixed feelings that can feel very confusing and disorientating. However I try to stay feeling as positive as I can, rather than letting it all get to me. So a lot of people probably don't even realise how I'm truly feeling.
