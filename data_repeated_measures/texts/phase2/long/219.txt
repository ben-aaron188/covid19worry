I am frustrated with the procrastination; no one is guaranteed tomorrow and we should just take our chances, I am fed up with the stupidity of the masses, the gullibility and being treated like an idiot by the government et al. I always wash my hands, catch sneezes/coughs etc, regardless of a pandemic, as people should - these are prudent measures to take anyhow to avoid other respiratory viruses, gastrointestinal viruses etc. If people only knew how much false information is being dished out from all corners, including manipulation and social engineering from the government, they would be astounded to see how much they have been coerced and manipulated.
