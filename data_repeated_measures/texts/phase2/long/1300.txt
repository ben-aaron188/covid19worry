I really miss my boyfriend; I haven't been able to see him for nearly three months now because of the Corona situation. I'm also worried that he will get sick. And I have a house move pending and I am stressed about that too, and the Corona situation just makes that worse because it adds complexities. I have a four-year-old daughter who started school in September, and I've worried about her socialisation and learning during lockdown too, as well as worrying about my work situation because I'm self-employed and home schooling doesn't help with that either.
