I am mostly angry at the government's handling of the pandemic. 126,000 people are dead because of the Conservative's selfishness and incompetence. Â£10 billion pounds of taxpayer money was given to their friends, and wasted on a failed track and trace service. The Tories' handling of the pandemic has been the final straw in wanting to leave the UK and live the rest of my life in another country. I had my first vaccination yesterday and I feel unwell, but optimistic that after my next jab in June I will be mostly immune to covid and I can stop living my life fearfully. My mask is strawberry print and VERY cute though, so I think I will wear it after the mandate to wear them is lifted, particularly this coming winter during flu season, as I never organise my flu jab.
