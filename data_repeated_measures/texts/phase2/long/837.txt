I'm worried for economic and social reasons. The lockdown has gone on far far too long its unfair keeping people so isolated and alone for so long. I miss my family and friends and I'm unsure and anxious about what is going to happen next.  I feel lonely  and sad and rarely ever happy.Corona is nowhere near as bad as initially thought so cant we just all get back to normal now.

This is my full answer I don't know what to add to get the characters up.
