Disgust at how the UK government has handled the corona situation the majority of the public has suffered as a result and it is completely frustrating that no actions has been undertaken over the outright lies.
There seems to be a cabal of people close to the government or within government that are shamelessly profiteering from the situation, ultimately at the cost of human lives. 
There is hope in the vaccines but even then the UK Gov. are playing games with the supply to the home nations.
2022 before things get back to normal i think and even then the loss of life should not be forgotten.
