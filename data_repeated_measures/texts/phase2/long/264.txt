annoyed. I would argued with everyone about everything. I do not feel like old me. Sometimes I wonder how much longer my partner will tolerate me.. 
I feel sick watching TV and all in the news is focus on the virus. At the same time I do feel for people with high level of anxiety because of that. Those numbers should stop immediately not to scare people. they do not do any good to anyone.
I am also worried that I will lose my job and won't be able to provide and find new job.  All what has happened since march last year is a farce.  We are  being ruled by the clueless bunch of people that are unable to admit to their mistakes. Telling people not to do something but acting like it does not apply to them. That makes me really angry.
