At this very moment I feel relieved that an end seems to be in sight for lockdown.  Many people are happy to have the vaccine and feel slightly safer.  I do not approve of the suggestion that vaccine passports should be brought in.  I feel the Corona situation has been overblown for an illness which has a ninety-nine percent survival rate, and worry that this had been at the expense of other illnesses such as cancer and heart disease.  The knock-on effect from other illnesses, and a decline in peoples mental health will cause repercussions for some time.
