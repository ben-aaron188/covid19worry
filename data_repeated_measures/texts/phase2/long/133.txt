I feel very anxious. The government has dealt with covid appallingly badly, not locking down in time, making a total farce of test and trace, causing tens of thousands of people to die unnecessarily. I'm scared that under the strong influence of the tory right, which objects to any kind of restrictions, the government will reopen everything too fast and we'll go into a third wave, and another lockdown. I'm worried about my teenage daughter's mental health. The only thing I feel slightly better about than before is the fact of the vaccine. Other than that, it's all very grim.
