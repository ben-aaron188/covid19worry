The coronavirus situation has been around for a year now, I think it’s come to the point where people are fed up of being cooped up inside on lockdown, so we just need to start learning to live with coronavirus and get on with our lives. I’m glad they have found a vaccine, I’m a bit weary of having it as they made it within a year, but I will take it if it means life will just go back to normal. I’ve been following the rules, but this 3rd lockdown within Wales is just too much so I’ve just been carrying on with my life as normal!
