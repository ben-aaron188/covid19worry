I feel really anxious still as I just want to see my family. Although, I am somewhat hopeful due to the vaccine roll-out, it still feels like we have a long way to go and Im worried that we will experience again what we did in december 2020, this year. it feels really isolated still, as we cannot see people and although i know why lockdowns are really really important, i just wish for normality to resume. i definitely think we could be handling it better as a lot of people just do not seem to wish to comply with the current national lockdown restrictions.
