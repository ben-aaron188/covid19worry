At the moment I am worried and anxious about the future regarding corona. Recently the government announced its plan to reduce lock down measures and open everything up again and it worries how excited people are getting for this when I think if everything opens too quickly we will just be put into another lockdown. As a result I am apprehensive about moving forward and it is negatively affecting me in the sense that I donâ€™t want to plan anything for the near future for the fear that corona will ruin it.
