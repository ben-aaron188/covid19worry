I feel scared and angry. Schools are opening again. It makes me anxious because I have family who are at risk and they're being told to shield, but that's useless if I have to go out because of how incompetent our government is. I don't want to lose anyone. I also feel the pressure of school and sometimes it feels too much. I'm stuck at home and while it's meant to be my safe space I feel like I can't stay here anymore either because school has intoxicated it so much into an environment I hate. It's gotten so bad sometimes I wonder whether hurting myself would be better. my mental health is suffering and no matter how much I try explain to my teachers the work is piling on more and more and I can't take it. This is all happening because first time we had a lockdown our government were to concerned about losing money to do it properly
