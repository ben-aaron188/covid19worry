i personally have really enjoyed my time in lockdown with my family, and realise that work will be coming back and life will be going back to normal. I'm not afraid of the disease, but at the same time, I'm still being careful and don't want to catch it. I get angry when i see other people still flouting the rules, which upsets me, as its these people that have caused the problem to be worse then it could have been. i also REALLY hate the media questions towards to the government on TV. There is no need to be so negative and ask questions that are so rude and condescending. Why not ask more positive useful constructive questions.
