I feel anxious and worried about the future and how I will cope in the hard times ahead.

I worry about my family and friends and people in general as we come to terms with what has happened and try to cope in future and rebuild our lives.

I'm afraid that the current Government is the wrong one for the times we face and will not prioritise support for the things that matter most, such as public services, affordable housing, pay & pensions.

I feel very afraid about my financial situation in the future, especially as I am currently relying on a modest pension and I would be limited in going back to work to work to earn more money. 

I feel afraid to spend what money I do have and that I should save it as prices are increasing and my income will be decreasing (eg income tax relief frozen).

I feel as if my life is on hold but now that the vaccination is being rolled out I fee that there is hope - light at the end of the tunnel. Knowing  that helps me to tolerate the frustrations and loneliness of lockdown and I am starting to think about what I will do when the restrictions are lifted.

I want to be able to meet people and socialise and to get out of my local environment and visit other places, especially the countryside.
