I feel okay about it. It's progressing and getting better, especially with the vaccincations being rolled out. It's still scary and I don't enjoy not being able to see people properly but its what is needed. I feel a bit anxious about things opening up again but mostly okay I just hope everyone will be safe and sensible. But overall I am trying to stay optimistic about where we're heading. I feel safe as well as my university is doing weekly COVID testing and I have been given the vaccine as I am training to be a healthcare worker
