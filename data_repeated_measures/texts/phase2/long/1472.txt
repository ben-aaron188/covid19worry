I feel anxious about the current coronavirus situation at the moment. Although the cases in my country are currently going down, I worry that when we come out of lockdown again they will start to rise and we will return to square one. I also worry about other people’s response to the situation and think that it is not being taken seriously enough. I think the government’s response to the situation has been wholly inadequate, they took too long to respond to the rise in cases and as a result we have ended up in a much worse predicament than we could have been.
