I feel that it is very serious and it is a national and international issue that needs to be dealt with seriously and with great care and attention. Personally, however, I have not been affected by it much - none of my friends or family, or even people I know have had it, only those such as my friends friend or my friends family - so I I donâ€™t feel afraid to live my life. I do, however, take all precautions such as wearing a mask, social distancing and sanitising my hands. My workplace has also stayed open (I work in a solicitors office) but closed to clients, which has made me feel less worried about the pandemic as I still have a sense of normality and am not just cooped up in my own home alone and hearing the negative statistics
