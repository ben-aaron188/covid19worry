I am still quite annoyed at the way the government has dealt with the whole pandemic in the UK but it very much feels like his period of time is coming to a close. Lockdown particularly the third time around has been difficult to deal with due to the disruption it's caused and the length of time it has taken. However, the vaccination process appears to be working fairly well and there does seem to be a way out of this mess which contributes to any optimism. Seeing countries in other places around the world return to normality has also contributed to such a feeling.
