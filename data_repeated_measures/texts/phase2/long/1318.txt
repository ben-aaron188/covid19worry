More than anything, I feel tired and borderline drained from the COVID situation. In some ways, it feels easier to try and have no expectation or hope for restrictions lifting. The constant relaxing and subsequent re-implementation of rules is difficult to continue to deal with, and almost feels worse than having one protracted lockdown. As I sit here on a Friday night, I feel a bit more relaxed than I usually would, but I also look at the calendar and can see that substantial relaxation is still months away, and it's an unpleasant feeling to know that we will still have months to go until things might go back to normal.
