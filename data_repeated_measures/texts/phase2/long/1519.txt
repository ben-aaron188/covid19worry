Anxious that we might still have to go into isolation.my son is returning to college on Monday, they seemed to have a lot of positive cases before the last lockdown . I worry about his health and  this will affect my work situation.  I am trying to move house, so hope Covid doesn’t impact my move. I would like to fast forward time as I miss seeing my family . I understand the restrictions and do understand the importance of following them. I am looking forward being able to see family and friends when we can. I am frustrated that as someone who works in early years we haven’t had access to the lateral flow test that staff in school have had. We have had to remain open to all. Working in this environment you get to discover that children do not show positive for Covid in the same way as adults. Parents are also rightly reluctant to test their children. So I don’t think we will ever get a honest result of how it effects early years. I think they are carriers and that they can pass it I. Without too many serious symptoms themselves.
