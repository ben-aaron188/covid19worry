I feel the last year has been a complete waste of time. i find it hard to find anything to be positive about. So much time wasted, so much debt, how will we ever pay for all this.Will we have to lock down every few months for ever more. What long term affects will this have on our children. So many people suffering with depression and anxiety,people losing their buisnesses  . Its all so incredibly sad and frustrating and depressing. Will we ever get back to normal. will we ever be able to take our face masks off. Will we ever have normal christmas's , family parties again.
