Things are moving towards going back to normal. Whilst this is great, I feel like I am a different person now compared to before the pandemic, and I fed nervous and anxious of going back to how things were before. I have enjoyed not feeling FOMO during this time. I’m also looking forward to things like holidays returning, but I am also super anxious about getting on a plane. This pandemic has really affected my mental health as well more than ever in my life, and I’m a bit worried that the support I’ve been offered up until now will just disappear when restrictions relax, and there will be an expectation for my mental health to “go back to normal”
