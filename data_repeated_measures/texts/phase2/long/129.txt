Overall I less worried about that Corona than I have been in the past. However I am still anxious in case i catch it. Once I get the vaccination at some point then I will start to feel less anxious. However, I still worry for all the countries who don't have the vaccine. I have friends in other countries who although they have less corona deaths and cases, don't have access to any vaccines, so I worry about them.
Overall I am happy with how the government is handling the pandemic, although my income has been severely cut so can't wait to be able to get back earning a decent amount of money.
