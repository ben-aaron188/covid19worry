I'm still anxious. I am at high risk and feel robbed of the last 12 months, and sad for my son who's missed so.much.

I'm moderately concerned and certainly less anxious than I was, having had a first dose, but the overall feeling is that this won't ever end. I am struggling with major health anxiety which, for the last 12 months was focused on catching and dying from covid, however now I've had a first dose the feeling of concern around that is slightly less but instead has been replaced with other concerns. A painful toe? Must be diabetes. Back ache? Must be a reaction to the vaccine. IBS, must be concern. And so on, I can often only think of catastrophising any minor niggle. Of course, these are minor things but the impact of the pandemic on my mental health is absolutely massive
