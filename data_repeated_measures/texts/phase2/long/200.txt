I am taking all steps to reduce my risk while I wait for my vaccination injections.  I am slightly hopeful that we will gain some normality within the next 6 months, but will remain calm and patient if it turns out to take a lot longer to do so.
It is a little frustrating that we still cannot see friends and family, but hopefully the worst is now over and as we have already waited 12 months so far, a little longer is not going to make mush difference.
We are lucky not to have had our incomes adversly affected and that the people we know who have had Covid19 have all only suffered minor symptoms and have come through it well.
