I feel rather fed up and bored of the situation now. I know I am lucky to not have caught the virus or know anyone close to me who has passed away from it. The government did not handle the situation properly and a year later we are back in the same place. I work for the NHS so I know how awful the situation has been especially for those seriously ill who weren't even allowed to have visitors. Hopefully with the roll out of the vaccine things will get better and we can return to doing all the things we enjoyed. I am looking forward to taking my kids on a nice family holiday when we can.
