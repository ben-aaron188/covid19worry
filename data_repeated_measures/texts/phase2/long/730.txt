At the moment things seem positive as the vaccine is being rolled out and cases are dropping but I still feel anxious that cases will pick up again in autumn after people have been allowed to mix and the summer is over as it did last year. If that does happen I cannot see what the government can do as the country seems incapable of having a complete proper lockdown like New Zealand or australia did. Hopefully even if cases do pick up again the vaccine will mean that it is not fatal due to the impact of the vaccine.
