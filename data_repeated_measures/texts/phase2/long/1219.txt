I am disappointed that it has gone on for so long and that the government handled the situation so badly at the beginning of the pandemic by delaying a response such as appropriate lockdown early enough. I am slightly hopeful that with the vaccine roll-out that things may begin to return at least a more ""familiar"" normal by the end of the year. I am anxious about how the situation has affected work opportunities and potential wage reductions in any available jobs. I feel that I am fortunate in that while I am out of work that my financial situation is not yet in a bad situation and I'm hopeful that I will be able to work again before I get into any possible difficulties.
