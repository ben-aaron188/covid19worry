I feel exhausted after more than one year of lockdown because of Corona, my mental health has deteriorated as i haven't seen family and friends all this time, not having holiday.

Also because i have worked and still working during this crisis, i'm worried that i might catch the virus, so everyday i'm extremely anxious.

 i'm fed up with the whole situation ,i just want things to get back to normal.

i'm anxious, worried about my job, my finances and my health as well.

i'm worried about the vaccine, i don't know if i'm going to take it or not, i guess will see.
