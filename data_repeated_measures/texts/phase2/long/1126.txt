the corona situation currently makes me feel really sad. So many lives lost! If the government had made harder and harsher decisions i feel that the country would be in a better place for sure. I am glad that most people will have had their vaccines now, and although i am a key worker and have worked throughout the WHOLE of the pandemic as a early years practitioner, I have no eligibility for the vaccine until my age group has priority (i'm 26). That is a huge kick in the teeth not only for me, but those who work in my sector.
