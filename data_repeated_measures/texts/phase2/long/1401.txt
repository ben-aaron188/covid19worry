i feel its getting better and we will get back to normal soon. although, i do feel that we might )be back into another lockdown very soon. the worst is over (for now) but lockdown should have never been lifted, as in a few weeks times or months, the people who have not got vaccinated will stil be susceptible to the virus, increasing infections, and the pandemic will continue yet again.

this is specifically to England, i dont really follow any other countries but i feel this will definitely happen in England.
