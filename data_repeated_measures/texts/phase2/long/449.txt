I feel sad at how many people have lost their lives through this pandemic, how many people are struggling to go about their daily lives due to the restrictions set in place and how many people are struggling financially because of it. I'm even more worried now that due to the Job Retention Scheme and the Furlough Scheme, we are in a huge debt which will lead to a financial crisis very soon and we as the people of this country, especially the working people will be affected badly by it, having to pay more tax in order to cover up for the government.
