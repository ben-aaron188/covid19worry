I am getting my jab today so I am feeling quite relaxed after shielding for my wife's sake and then, following my heart attack, my own. As a family we have followed guidelines and taken precautions to protect one another. I am concerned though about the return to school and the incompetent way our useless money grabbing government have dealt with it again.

It's been a different and difficult year but in reflection I believe it's actually been good for the family and we have bonded closer through the situation. I don't think the world will go back and it was, working from home will become a norm for alot of people and that will help work family balance. There have been other benefits with people engaging with nature more and the environment repairing itself whilst the world locked down. But my concern is the governments and big business will not learn at all.
