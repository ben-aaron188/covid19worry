I feel a little less worried than I did a year ago mainly due to the vaccine.  I am still somewhat anxious due mainly to the amount of people who are willing to flout the restrictions imposed for our good, as was seen last weekend when the weather was better. Their actions are not condemned by the main stream media who seem to be going out of their way to find a way of undermining the good work that the majority of the UK have been doing to control the virus. Their is a slight glimmer of a light at the end of the tunnel but it will still be a long while and I'm not convinced we will ever return to truly ""normal""
