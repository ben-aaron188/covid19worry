I Feel anxious when out and about, I have had my 1st vaccine but still feel scared of other people who dont keep a social distance from me ot when I have to go inside a shop.
Feel happy at home and glad that the cases are falling. Financial worries dont help. My son will be starting back at college which is making me a bit more worried incase he brings the virus back home. My partner is a school bus driver which is worrying me incase he  catches it from the children at school, he has also had his first vaccine which will protect him a little. I worry about the virus mutating again and if the vaccine would be effective.
