I feel very angry and disappointed in the government at their treatment of NHS workers during the pandemic. I have some optimism and hope in light of the vaccine, I hope we will be able to visit my partner's family who live in another country before next year. I feel frustrated and worried about not being able to receive the vaccine of my choice, I would feel much safer having the vaccine which is the most effective. I am stressed from at being inside all the time, and am struggling to make or maintain any friendships, this makes me sad. But overall I am extremely happy to be living with my partner now, as I wasn't at the beginning of the pandemic.
