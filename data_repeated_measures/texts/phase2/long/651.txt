I am frustrated. They are giving the vaccines to people who are not going out, people who are elderly and not allowed out. Yet those of us who are going out, and working are not getting vaccines yet. Also, angry that they are not giving vaccines to those shop workers who deal with a large number of customers everyday.

I want freedom, every other country is living life as normal but with masks and cleaning etc. Yet i can't even go out to visit my family. I work in a pub and have been out of work for the majority of a year, pubs spent 1000's on PPE for this only to get shut down. It's all backwards.
