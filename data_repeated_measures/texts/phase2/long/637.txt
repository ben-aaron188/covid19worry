I am ok and got set into this so-called 'routine.' I do not feel angry or anything. I think more and more strains of Covid-19 will appear from time to time and we just have to live with them. Vaccines are hit and miss. If you are lucky with them. Some can get seriously ill with the Vaccine itself. So I am not sure how this is going to work out in a long run. I keep myself busy and do workouts at home as the gyms have been shut for such a long time. I am contented at this present moment. I also feel motivated to start something of my own. Something which I am very passionate about.
