Quite hopeful, but with some anxiety still.  Our cases and death rate are falling significantly, which is great, but we are still in lockdown, which is hard going now.  I am living in an area which is considered a local hotspot, so even though the numbers are coming down nationally, it does feel like my area has some risk attached in everyday activities.

I have had my first dose of vaccine, which helps reduce my anxiety, but I do have some younger family members not vaccinated yet.  Older members of my family have had their vaccines, some both doses, so that really does reduce my anxiety about their health.
