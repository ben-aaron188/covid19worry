I feel unsure of the future but a little more hopeful that we will eventually return to something closer to normality.
My parents have received the vaccine so i'm happier knowing they are more protected.
I'm confused as to if i should accept the vaccine or not, i'm still unsure on it's long term side effects, however I think we will have to take the vaccine to be allowed to socialise normally in the future. 
I'm enjoying working from home and feel that is where my anxiety lies. If we do have to return to full time office work, I think that would have a very negative impact on my mental health.
