Being in lockdown for a full year has had a horrendous effect on many. Not only on a personal level but also the economical consequences would be horrendous. No one is looking after the mental health of people and not to mention the terminal patients that had no treatement for months. This has been complete shambles and I cannot believe anyone thinks locking down entire country for a year is ever going to work. Do i really have to write more than this? Is this an essey writing excercise? I feel fed up and tired and sooo cornered.
