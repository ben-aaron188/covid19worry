I feel hopeful and optimistic that in the next few months covid will disappear and we can go back to living a normal life. 
The case nums are going down which is good news. 
There are still a few factors that may cause case nums to go back up again such as schools reopening etc but many people have had vaccines so maybe this will stop the cases rising again.

Overall I am looking forward to living a normal life again and seeing friends/family and going to bars. The government haven't done too well to combat covid as there are many unemployed people struggling to find work and our high street stores are dying but there is nothing we can do about it. Would have been interesting to see how Labour would have dealt with fighting covid-19 instead of the conservatives.
