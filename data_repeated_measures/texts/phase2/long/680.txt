I am sad that the situation has gone on for so long. My main reason for feeling this way is due to having a young child who has now missed out on a year of her life not being able to go out and do fun things such as going to the zoo, aquarium, etc. I am excited for the world to get back to normal so we can begin to do fun things again.
I am also worried about how the economy will bounce back from the huge financial hit its taken. 
I am hopeful that the government's latest roadmap will help us out of lockdown, hoping that we dont see another rise in cases when things start to reopen. 
I am excited to be able to enjoy summer with my family and friends, who I have barely seen over the last year.
The first lockdown enabled me to spend precious time at home with my family.
I am still working from home and have been since the start of the first lockdown. I dont expect that to change any time soon, and am quite enjoying it.
