I am worried about the cornovirus situation and I am worried about contracting the virus. I am worried my friends or family may get the virus. However I feel optimistic about future and that the situation will be controlled and managed. Also the vaccine is a great step in the right direction. I hope life does get back to normal in the coming year so I can meet family and friends. I feel isolated without meeting my family and friends and not socialising as before the cornovirus outbrake. I have however been able to take care of myself and reflect in the meantime.
