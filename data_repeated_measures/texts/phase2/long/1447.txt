At this moment I am anxious because we are exiting lockdown and when economy reopens covid will again spread to high levels of cases as has been proven to do before. There are new strain cases and no new guidelines for schools etc (my son is 5 and can still cuddle ALL his classmates). I feel there are too many of the public not adhering to the rules put in place to keep others and self safe. Schools run a major risk of transmitting virus as simply can't implement the safety needed, its nurseries and younger years having case loads. Cant expect older children and teens not to socialise closely either, its unrealistic. In my opinion there should be a lockdown style approach until everyone is vaccinated even if it takes a couple of years. Wellbeing may be affected but we are in a PANDEMIC so sacrifices for the long run need to be made. Going in and out of lockdowns with mass deaths and cases per time isn't doing any good. Problem with the UK is compliance, government don't know how to enforce as public have zero respect. 
Since the beginning and even now I was/disinfect products from shops, limit my outings to places like the shops (deliveries instead), have not seen friends and family properly in over a year, take my son to outdoor parks/public areas, my son doesn't get to play after school with anyone.. we do everything more than by the book to stay safe as son has asthma and I'm a smoker so our lungs not the best. Whats the point when half the public not even bothering and the government can't wait to reopen everywhere and end up back to square one? Thats where I'm at.
