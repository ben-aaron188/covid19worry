Happy that things are starting to improve. I am ok eased that so many are getting their vaccination and that the rollout happened quickly. Nervous that it may all change and we will end up in another lockdown as I feel the general population is not sticking to the rules. They think the vaccinations  will protect them no matter what and a lot of people seem to be flouting the rules because of this. I feel like people in general have given up their respect for the guidelines and are approaching this with a selfish attitude.
