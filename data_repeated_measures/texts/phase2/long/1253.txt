Hopeful that the situation with Corona virus has dramatically improved from where we were and that restrictions will soon be easing meaning that we can plan for the future again and see friends and family. Happy with the vaccine roll out and that Iâ€™ve had my first vaccination. Anxious for social situations / busier life and that case increases may not be acted on to protect the economy. Still annoyed at the government handling of the situation ie acting too late and making bad decisions. I feel for everyone effected especially small businesses who have lost their livelihoods.
