At this very moment, I am quite frustrated with the corona situation, the government has not handled the pandemic as well as it should have. Being in lockdown is not fun and I would like it to be over soon. I'm anxious about how the situation has affected people close to me, as many people have had a much worse time than I have. However, I feel positive about the future, I believe the vaccines are effective and that enough people will take them so that we will be in a much more normal situation come the summer.
