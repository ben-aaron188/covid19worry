I feel a little more relaxed about the corona situation at the moment because I am following all the government guidelines. I am wearing a mask when I'm out and I'm only out when I need something that is essential. I keep 2 meters away from other people and I regularly keep my hands washed and clean. 
I am still a little worried about my elderly family members who live in higher populated areas but I also know that they are sticking to the guidelines and keeping themselves safe.
As long as I stick to the rules and regulations put out by the government I feel at ease with situation.
