Right now I feel like I have had enough of this whole  covid 19 situation, my youngest  daughter has just  tested positive within the past few days for covid 19, which she contracted at school now we are self isolating and having to home school again after they have only been back at school for about three weeks. thankfully she doesn’t seem to have many symptoms apart from being a bit warmer and feeling a bit  tired, I’m now waiting to see if the rest of the family have caught covid 19 aswell.   I haven’t seen my own parents or sister in nearly a year, and my children are missing the grandparents and it is just starting to feel stressful
