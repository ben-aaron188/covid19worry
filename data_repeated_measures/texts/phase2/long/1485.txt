Still quite anxious about it. Happy that lots of people are getting vaccines and that it seems to be having an effect. But worried about what the last 12 months has left behind in relation to state of the economy, folk holding off seeing their doctor and therefore more terminal illness diagnoses, fear of going back to some sort of normality and not wanting everything back as it was. Looking forward to spending time with family and friends again. Have got used to working from home and hope this continues.
