I feel great sadness at the number of people affected by it. Especially sad for those who have suffered a loss, the children who have missed out on education etc.
I have also valued the extra time with my family. Without homework, without extra curriculum clubs, etc, even though children have missed out on the social and fitness aspect of these, the extra time has enabled us to go back to basics. We've enjoyed playing board games together, going on long walks, cooking different meals, baking, etc.
