I am very worried about the effects on the economy and people's lives. It will be very hard for young people whose education has been disrupted and their hopes for jobs in the future are grim. I think there are a lot of mental health problems developing as well. I don't believe the government know what they are doing! They have made bad decisions all through the last year. I believe they should now reduce restrictions sooner than planned. A lot of money and effort has been put into saving the lives of the elderly and the obese, now the government should think more about the younger people.
