I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm waiting for my second vaccine. I miss my family and friends. I miss travelling and going on holiday abroad. I miss going for meals at restaurants with my friends and family. I miss socialising and going to the cinema. This is such a surreal time and it feels like a movie. I have lost friends to the virus. Working in the NHS I see the effects and how hard the nurses and clinicians have worked. The NHS has received great support from local businesses which is great recognition.
