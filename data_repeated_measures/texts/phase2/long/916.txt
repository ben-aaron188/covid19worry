I am looking forward to things being relaxed and being able to do more things. I have been fortunate during the pandemic that my financial situation hasnâ€™t changed but am fed up of going to work (as a key worker) but that is the only thing I am really allowed to do. It is not good for mental health to only be allowed to work and exercise locally, it has been difficult. I also am not happy with the portrayal of education workers during the pandemic as the media and government have suggested they refuse to play their part, even though they have mostly been working just as hard as regular times.
