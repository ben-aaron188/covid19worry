I am very optimistic due to the vaccine rollout. Its been a very hard year but its positive we can see the end and hopefully this means that summer we can enjoy a stressed free period where everyone is enjoying life. I just hope that people stick to rules and not be stupid when restrictions start loosening up as I know that some people can be a bit stupid and think its an opportunity to hold parties etc. I know i wish this wont happen but there will be people who will do this and that frustrates me extreamly.
