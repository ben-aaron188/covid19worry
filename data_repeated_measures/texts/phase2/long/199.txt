I feel I have managed pretty well relative to many other people. I have a new job and I’m pleased the kids are going back to school next week. I’m optimistic about the near to middle future and hopefully others will start to feel the same. I have arranged to meet friends and family as soon as the restrictions have lifted and this gives me something to look forward to.

I feel my family has dealt with this very well and if anything we have all become much closer, especially my two children who have spent a lot of time together.
