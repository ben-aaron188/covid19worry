I feel more positive now because, with the vaccine rollout, the vulnerable have more protection. I am still anxious about vulnerable family members catching it, but less than before because of the vaccine. However I will be much happier when they finally receive their second dose of the vaccine. I am hopeful about the positives as life slowly returns to normal in the coming months. I am anxious about returning to work though. I feel that this will again increase my chances of contracting the virus. I am also missing family members who I have been unable to see for a very long time.
