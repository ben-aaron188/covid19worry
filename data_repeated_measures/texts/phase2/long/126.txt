I am currently Very very stressed at the moment, as I have multiple elderly family members at greater risk of Covid due to age also more due to medical conditions. My daughter will return to college next week so will be at greater risk as travelling on four buses a day plus the mixing with so many people throughout the college day. They have put some safety measures in to try and keep students healthy but still a big worry to me. we already lost one member of extended family to Covid in October of last year. I don't want to lose anybody else or see anyone suffer. It's keeping me awake at night overthinking about all the bad things that could happen to friends and family
