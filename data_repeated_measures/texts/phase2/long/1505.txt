I am hopeful that the vaccine has started to be given out in mass and this is the first time that the end is potentially in sight. However, I am still quite anxious about catching the virus as I am low priority to receive the vaccine and more people I know are catching the virus now than a year ago. This makes me feel anxious. 

I recognise that the end may potentially be in sight and this makes me happy and has given me motivation to carry on with life. The pandemic has made my studies difficult and I wish that normality would resume so that my education can be unaffected.
