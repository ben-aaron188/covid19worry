I feel the Corona situation is getting better, however I also feel it has been badly mismanaged by the government. I feel saddened at the amount of avoidable deaths that have occurred because we didn't lockdown soon enough on 3 occasions, I feel angry at the way the government has tried to blame people for behaving badly when they made the biggest mistakes. I feel like the recovery will hit the poorest hardest and that will be incredibly unfair. Once the situation has been improved, I suspect the NHS will once again be left to fend for itself and won't be funded to the degree that is necessary. I suspect that the government will seize the opportunity to impose more austerity on the population.
