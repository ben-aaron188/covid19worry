I'm feeling slightly more relaxed as me and my family have come this far without any of us knowingly contracting Covid, even though my mum is a front-line worker. It is obviously reassuring that vaccines are being implemented, however I'm still anxious about what might happen with children going back to school and people advocating for them to not have to wear masks in school...also concerned about how many people will not get vaccinated for one reason or another. I'm worried that in the meantime between a significant amount of people being vaccinated, we will see people become overly lax and allow for another resurgence.
