I feel like the situation is feeling and looking better at the moment, as the rates are going down and more people are getting vaccinated, especially family members and people I know. I'm slightly worried about the new variants and if this will make things worse, and we might have to go back into a lockdown again. Or if they start going infecting people who have been vaccinated. However I was quite impressed at the fact they seem to have found the people with the new variants quite quickly. 
Right now I feel quite relaxed and happy, I don't mind lockdown as I can work from home and I live with my fianc√©. But I am looking forward to the lockdown easing, and seeing more people and going more places.
