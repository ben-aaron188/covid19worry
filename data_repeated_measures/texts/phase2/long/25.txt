I am not worried about catching corona. I think we are in control of the corona virus, I still haven't had my vaccination but I should be having it in a few weeks. I just want to resume normal life and for all the shops to reopen. I think it will be at least a year before everything reopens like cinemas and theatres. What I miss the most is being able to go to a pub for a meal and meeting friend for a chat, It is done now through online messaging. It is depressing with nowhere to go but It won't be so bad when the weather improves and we have a bit of sunshine, everything feels better when the sun is shining.
