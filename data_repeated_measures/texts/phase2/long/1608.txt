I am optimistic that the end is in sight and we will be back to normal soon. I get frustrated and angry when I hear about people breaking the lockdown rules. Day to day I am feeling pretty bored and fed up with lockdown. I am not worried about coronavirus having a negative impact on my life because my job is secure. I work from home so I am confident I will not catch the virus. I worry a bit about older family members getting ill but not so much now they are getting vaccinated. I haven't seen my parents for over a year now so I am looking forward to finally seeing them again soon.
