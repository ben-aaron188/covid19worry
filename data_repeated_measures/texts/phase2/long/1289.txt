I feel many opportunities have been missed to bring the virus under control and as a result it will take longer to return to normality. I worry about the impact this will have on my future as both my family and business plans are still at an early stage despite my progressed age. It is hard with so much uncertainty about the virus to see the path ahead. My main concerns are that some restrictions such as masks, social distancing and travel may be with us for a long time to come without some stricter measures in the short term.
