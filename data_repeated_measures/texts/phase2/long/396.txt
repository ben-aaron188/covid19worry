im angry with the general population in regards as to how they have treated the situation, boris johnson definitely hasnt done the best job with covid but the public have not helped at all, they complain about lockdowns, break the rules knowing they shouldnt, and then complain when the lockdown gets worse because of THEIR actions

im fortunate enough to have not have had any family of mine be infected with covid or anyone i know and my job hasnt been affected too negatively either

im hoping borin johnson will be able to keep his word about lifting the restrictions on the set days aslong as the public can follow the rules
