I feel like it’s a wasted time in many peoples lives that could have been prevented through simple empathy from government leaders. Logical minds told them this could be over with a full lockdown, but the economy took priority over peoples lives. 

The pandemic has proven how incapable our leaders are, how little they care about the lives of those poorer than them, and this situation has gone on for way longer than it has needed to be. Many people are angry about the stolen time they won’t get back.
