I am very excited and hopeful about things opening up.  I feel it is almost possible to make plans in the future.  I feel confident in allowing my child back to school although I would prefer that children did not have to wear masks in the classroom.  

I am very excited about having my vaccine and i check most days if I am eligible yet.  

However I am shocked that this has happened and feel that it was handled very badly by the Government.  I am particularly cross about money being made by friends of Ministers.  I think a lot of very bad decisions were made last year, although this year has been better.
