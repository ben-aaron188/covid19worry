I cannot believe it is almost a year since we went into the first lock down. It feels like a year of lifetime lost and I am worried that we will not be able to lave this country even by the summer as I have family abroad. I am angry with this government, actually with the whole western world, for not taking it seriously enough at the beginning which I think is the reason or the mess we are in today. And politically I fear that because of the success of the vaccination rollout people are going to forget that this government made sure the people at the top are not suffering the (financial) consequences of this pandemic, but those at the bottom will for years to come
