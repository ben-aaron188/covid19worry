I feel anxiety for myself and my family. I am a front line worker and next week will be mixing with 900 plus people per day again. I am not vaccinated so I can't see my family safely even if I was allowed to, but I'm told it's 'safe' to deal with other people's. It's not safe - how can it be?I don't trust the government at all because there have been so many 'u' turns. I am now taking medication for anxiety and depression which all stems from the risk I associate with my job. Maybe I will feel differently as more people are vaccinated but what a sad, sad death toll this country has. Covid was not controlled or handled properly in the UK, from the start up until now.
