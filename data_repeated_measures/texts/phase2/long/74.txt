There is a slight ray of hope on the horizon, but the future is uncertain with new variants being discovered. I feel there is still some way to go before we can see things returning to normal, and we will be able to socialize with our friends. My feelings are probably gentle acceptance of the situation as there is little I can do to change it. Hope come with the successful vaccination roll out with the hope that the population will not refuse this opportunity. Personally we have everything delivered and do not go out at all, but we are very lucky to live in a rural area rather than in a city where this would be opressive.
