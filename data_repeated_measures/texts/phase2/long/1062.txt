I'm really worried about catching it as I have asthma and am yet to have a vaccination.  I worry that it'll put me in hospital and I'd be very sick.  I'm always having to be careful if I go out and I hate/have problems wearing a mask due to my severe anxiety (which I had before the coronavirus pandemic started).  I just want to get back to normal and live my life again how it was before the coronavirus hit.  I want to go back to doing what I used to do.  I've almost forgotten what that's like and I think it'll take time.
