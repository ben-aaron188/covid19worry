At the moment, I’m not only fearful for those catching coronavirus but also the easing out of lockdown. It’s intimidating and scary to think about after a year basically trapped inside. I’m nervous about how I will cope when the world is back up to full speed. I also fear for the well-being of so many people; coronavirus has been the biggest life adjustment for so many people, and many are more isolated than ever. Mental health problems are rife and there’s not enough support in place for people suffering.
