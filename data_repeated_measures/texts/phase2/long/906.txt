I still feel anxious as I don’t believe the end is in sight yet. I am reluctant to place too much belief in the vaccines helping us return to normal. There is a lot of different information out there regarding them and it’s difficult to know what to believe. I worry about the new variants and the problems they could cause. I am also worried about the social and economic consequences of the pandemic. Overall I feel too cautious to feel happy or look forward to the future, especially as even if the pandemic is almost over there are the economic and social consequences to deal with. Finally, I feel disappointed in the way that the U.K. government have handled this whole situation
