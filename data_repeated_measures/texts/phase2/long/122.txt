I am angry it has got this far. people are selfish. I am also angry and frustrated at the government's failure to act swiftly where much spread could have been stopped. It tuely feels like that have let it sweep through like wildfire as a stealth attempt at hear immunity. also, the waste and corruption involving massive amounts of public funds makes me despair. The fact the brexit was pushed through during this was insane. it is a relief that vacines are now coming through but I feel that life will not ever return to normal, even if some people are rushing ahead to try.
