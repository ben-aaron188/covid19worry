I feel like I have coped with coronavirus very well and haven't really suffered mentally from it. I think I am getting a bit weary of it like a lot of people and I'm very much looking forward to the prospect of things hopefully returning to some semblance of normality soon. I still think I will remain cautious until I have had the vaccine though. For me I am in work pretty much everyday so I have been able to have contact with people and has stopped me feeling isolated, but I miss meeting up with my friends, going to the gym and travelling.
