Frustrating, the government's don't seem keen to fix the problems and there's a real risk things will get worse and we'll miss the vaccine opportunity. The problem is communications and messaging.

Not having kids means that my life is quite different.

However, it's the weekend and I can chill out watching a film on Netflix.
