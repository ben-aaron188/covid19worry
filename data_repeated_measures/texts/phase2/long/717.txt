I am please to see how well the vaccine roll out is going and how the numbers are dropping in the UK. Im now hopeful that there is light at the end of the tunnel for us in the UK but still concerned how long this may go on for especially as the rest of the world is not showing many signs of their numbers dropping. I am also disappointed/angry at how badly our UK government dealt with the xmas holiday period, as in not locking down properly, as this has caused, in my view, around additional 20,000 deaths (which could easily of been avoided) and lengthened our lock down period in the UK by, again in my view, 2 to 3 months.
