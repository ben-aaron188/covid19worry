I’m feeling the most positive about the situation since this all started a year ago. We have vaccines now which are being well rolled out and there is a roadmap to reopening shops etc and getting life back to a more normal state. Cases are dropping as are deaths which is reassuring and joyful to hear. There is finally light at the end of a very long tunnel and I’m excited to get my jab and be able to meet up with friends, family and colleagues and do things in real life again as opposed to virtually.
