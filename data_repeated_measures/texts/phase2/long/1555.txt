Currently, I feel frustrated and angry. It has been a long time now where we have all been under tight restrictions. I feel stuck. This being said, I am also optimistic. I look forward to restrictions easing, and this is something that I am excited about. I also feel worried. I am worried that our future is uncertain, and cannot see much into the future and what life will look like. I am optimistic, but realistic. I do not want to get my hopes up to be let down. 

At this exact moment, I feel happy and a little anxious. I regularly read the news with regards to coronavirus and can see a positive change. I am hopeful for the future.
