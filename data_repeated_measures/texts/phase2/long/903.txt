I’m totally fed up with the restrictions and really bored. I’m less anxious now that my mum and my in laws have had their vaccines and I’m hoping to get my vaccine soon-ish even though I’m scared of needles. I am a bit worried about the emergence of new variants especially if they have a higher death rate and escape the vaccine, but the whole thing seems like painting the forth bridge- no sooner have we vaccinated everyone then we have to start again! This whole year has felt like stasis, and I’m keen for stuff to start happening again!
