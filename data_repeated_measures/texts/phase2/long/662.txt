Has been going on to long with to much spiraling in and out of lockdowns making me very anxious about the country opening up to fast to just be shut back down again. Sadness about not being able to see my family yet kids can mix at school and shops to soon be open. Sad to keep families apart from each other for so long. Just lacking any motivation to do anything or menial tasks like work tidying up or even keeping the house clean its not goid for my mental health and wellbeing. just hope that this will all end soon drai ing away very quickly the more people mix in uneccesary ways.
