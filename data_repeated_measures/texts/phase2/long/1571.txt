Utterly fed up of the complete fiasco, the environmental impact of all the single use PPE, the mental health toll, the financial loss, the personal loss, the complete change to democratic rights, the ludicrousy that one year on this is still a key focus when climate change, malnutrition and so many other vitally important situations deserve attention

If I never hear the word bubble, covid, mask, lockdown, tiers it would be far too soon . The impact has been huge and yet the government and schools want us just to carry on as though we donâ€™t need to process the hideousness of the past year
