At this current moment I feel very indifferent. I’m not sad or happy, I’m not extremely one emotion over another. I don’t want to get my hopes up to be let down and not be able to see my family. I’m not scared about catching it as it is what it is and I work in an environment where I could easily catch it. I’m just abit bored of the situation as a whole especially as I’m following the rules but other people aren’t. I just feel like I cannot be bothered to hear about it anymore or discuss it anymore.!
