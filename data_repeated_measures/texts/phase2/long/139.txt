I am fed up with the disruption to our lives the coronavirus has caused. I've been through the infection and am not scared of getting it anymore. I do appreciate it can be serious for a lot of people, but everyone should be allowed to make their own choices with regards to travelling, going out etc. I am anxious about what will the world look like afterwards and how will we all be affected. I think that our mental health will suffer because of the restrictions, especially the young people's (teenagers especially). I am frustrated and worried most of the time, but right now I just feel tired of it and a bit angry that I'm not allowed to do what I want.
