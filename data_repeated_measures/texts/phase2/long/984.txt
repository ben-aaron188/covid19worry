I have gotten used to the Coronavirus situation. I've made the best of a bad situation. Hopefully it'll be less restrictive soon and we can all start relaxing and enjoying life a bit more, rather than just trying to get through it. I am nervous about being made to go back to working in an office. I prefer working from home - it's been one of the few good things to come out of  coronavirus and lockdown. I hope it stays around once lockdown has been lifted. It's been brought but I have made the best of the poor situation.
