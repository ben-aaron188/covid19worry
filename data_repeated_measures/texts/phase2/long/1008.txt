This very moment, I feel moderately okay about corona. It is a mind over matter and to stay safe as much s possible. But still live life to the fullest, cause corona is making things short lived but also making time flow by very quickly.

However, it does seem to be getting better gradually. As long as people take care of their hygiene, wash their hands and etc accordingly as this all should be normality. 

Goes to show how unclean humanity can seriously be, it is basic knowledge and cleanliness
