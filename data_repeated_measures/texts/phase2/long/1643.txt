I feel fed up and also failed by the government. Thinking of how borris has dealt with it makes me angry. I also get annoyed when seeing people breaking the rules but also understand people are getting bored of being in lockdown without any benefits being seen. I think we should have done a short, strict lockdown this time last year rather than how it’s been dealt with. Although we have a roadmap out of lockdown I’m not getting my hopes up any time soon. I constantly compare us to New Zealand and how they have dealt with the pandemic and we should be embarrassed. I will continue to stick to the rules despite seeing others breaking the rules for my own conscious and also so I can be one contributing the lower infection rates in the country.
