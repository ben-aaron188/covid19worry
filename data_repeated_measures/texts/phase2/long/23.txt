I have had mixed feelings about Covid from the start. I've followed all the advice, taken all precautions etc so I'm sad to see such a devastating effect it's had on millions of families around the world, from death to financial losses.

On the flip side to this, I am quite an independent person who genuinely likes to stay in, watch movies, play games, play the guitar, work on my garden etc - so having the pressure of being a 30 something who is usually socially expected to be 'out and about' all the time taken away from me has made me more relaxed.

I also think that Covid in a way has saved my life. I haven't had the virus myself, but the shift in working from home and offering that flexibility in working hours and locations has been a game changer for me. I'm no longer getting up at 5am every day to do a 1 hour commute to work and being tired before I've begun, and then doing it again at the end of a long day. I get more sleep, I am more rested, I save hundreds of pounds extra a month from being at home rather than commuting, and I get to spend more time with my partner - the work/life balance has never ever been better for me which has led to me being more happy
