when I am at home or in my local surroundings I feel ok, I am comfortable that i am complying with regulations and looking after myself.
when i think about having to travel again for work, i feel sick and anxious, I do not want to be sitting on crowded trains and getting pushed at tube stations all to get to work, and put  myself at risk.

these are risks I feel are not necessary and my Employer should take that into account. I have been able to do my job at home for a year, so why can I not continue like this
