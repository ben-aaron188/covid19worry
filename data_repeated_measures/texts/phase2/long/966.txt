I'm a little angry that our government didn't respond quickly enough to a crisis it must have known was coming from China. I'm anxious about my daughter's mental health because of lockdown and the impact COVID 19 will have on her education, job prospects, and earning potential, particularly the taxes she'll have to pay to get the UK out of debt. I'm also worried about my 85-year old mother, even though she's had the first jab. I'm not worried for me. I'm nearing the end of my working life. COVID will have less of an impact on me than my daughter, who may need to deal with future COVIDs once I'm gone.
