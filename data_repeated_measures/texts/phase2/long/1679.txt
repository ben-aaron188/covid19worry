I feel very anxious all the time. About everyday tasks, about people’s behaviour, abou the future. I feel worried about my family, my self and friends because of the uncertainty that awaits us all if we catch this virus.
I miss visiting and being with friends and family not worried about what I’ve touched, about what they touched, about how many people touched my parcels when they arrive and having to tell my child to wait a couple of days before open it even though I have cleaned it with alcohol gel. I miss not to feel paranoid all the time. I miss  not to worry about laughing and hugging who I love to be with. I Miss relaxing moments, enjoying outdoor life, eating out or having a coffee somewhere with family or friends.
