I feel safe at the moment, I use to be worried but now I'm working from home and hardly go out apart from essentials the vaccines are doing well so there is light at the end of tunnel. So I guess at this moment in time I feel like it will come to end soon and the world will go back to normal. Its crazy to think it's been a year since the lock down when it first came out I thought it would be over in a few weeks time but now it's going to be ok and I feel relaxed about it all. This has to be more than 500 characters already I've wrote a right paragraph and there is still showing it needs to be the characters.
