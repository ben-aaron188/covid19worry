I am impressed at how the worlds scientists have worked together to tackle this worldwide problem.
I am happy and confident that there are a number of vaccines available, however,  I am concerned about the new virus varients that seem to be cropping up. I am also concerned that it may take up to a year for every country to complete its vaccination program and life to return completely back to normal.
Overall i feel a lot more optimistic than I did a year ago and think normality is definitely within sight for all of us.
