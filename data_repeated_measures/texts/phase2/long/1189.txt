I feel unmotivated and have little interest in things I used to due to the national lockdowns caused my the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a struggle to get through the days as I have so little to do. I rarely leave the house due to my university course being online, meaning I am not getting any environmental stimulation.  I am really hoping that the lockdown restrictions will end very soon and we get our freedom back. This will mean that the mental health of myself, my friends and my family will improve and I will find a reason to get up in the morning.
