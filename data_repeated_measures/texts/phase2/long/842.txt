The government have done nothing but jeopardise peoples health and safety whilst trying to save their own careers and line their friends pockets.  A lot more could have been done much earlier and we wouldn’t have so many deaths and our economy would have recovered much sooner.  After all that’s been done they still refuse to value the NHS offering pittance when they should be doing all the can to prevent the next pandemic by supporting our health service.           We are now the laughing stock of the world.
