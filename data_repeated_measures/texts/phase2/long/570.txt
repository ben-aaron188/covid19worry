I feel fairly relaxed and hopeful about the situation, rates are going down and people are being vaccinated. I have worked as a teacher throughout the pandemic and feel fairly relaxed about the situation. My children are back at school next week and am excited to get back to normality. I am also looking forward to seeing my family and going out to places that I havenâ€™t been able to go to for a year, such as swimming with my own children, seaside, gym and restaurants. So all in all, I think I am feeling hopeful, excited and relaxed about the whole corona situation.
