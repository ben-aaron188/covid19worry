I am tired of the pandemic and lovkdown restrictions and just wish that things could go back to some form of normality or that I could at least see my boyfriend again. I am working from home which I do not mind but miss seeing people as I only see my 2 housemates. I am fed up at the pandemic as I cannot do anything and worry when I see my family that I am going to be reported. I think that the light is at the end of the tunnel because of the vaccine, but I still haven't been I voted to have it and neither have my friends so I have no idea when it will benefit us
