I am scared mainly about schools opening, I feel the UK government has been very poor in their handling of the pandemic and I don't believe this will change. I am angered by hashtags on twitter supporting the cause of children not wearing facemasks in school when this is a way it has been shown to protect selves and others. I am angry about the ex Ofsted chief suggesting teachers should be prepared to sacrifice their lives for this pandemic - have lives not been sacrificed enough. I am scared we have all become desensitised to death figures or ICU figures etc. that hearing of people dying due to covid means less to the normal person - every death is a death which shouldn't have happened - its horrible
