Starting to get slightly frustrated with the lack of slackness to the rules as everything seems to be going a lot slower since the vaccines have started. I do feel a lot more positive about it all but it just needs to go a lot faster on opening up the country again. I work in the nhs and I see how drained everyone is so we need that hope that things will start to open again. We just keep hearing the same things all the time and itâ€™s getting to political as well especially in scotland as the snp are trying to always put one over Boris down there which is annoying to me.
