I feel sad and disappointed that the people not sticking to the rules spoil things for the rest of us.
I also feel angry that people are spreading the virus and don't care.
If people would just do what was asked lockdown wouldn't have been so long, This applies to all people whether they are rich, poor, famous or just a member of the public.
I am very worried about catching it and also concerned that a lot of people seem to think that once they have had one shot of the vaccine they can carry on as normal and meet family or friends.
This can only lead to cases rising again.
