The current situation is very bad, the pandemic has taken over our lives and lockdown makes it much worse. life is not how it used to be and theres not as much to look forward to. there is more darkness and a lot of anxiety surrounding the vaccines. I dont know what else to say, its bad for all of us, or at least 90% of us. I won't bother planning the summer or any holidays because its not guaranteed that we won't be in lockdown during that time. its difficult to trust the government at this point. A lot of people have been affected by covid, one way or another.
