At the moment I am not too worried about coronavirus because the vaccine is being rolled out across the country and worldwide so I'm just really looking forward to receiving it. I am a bit anxious about the new strains showing up though so I'm keeping an eye on that. I am way less anxious than this time last year.

I am also looking forward to traveling again after the restrictions are lifted in other countries because I haven't been on holiday for a while because I was scared of catching coronavirus
