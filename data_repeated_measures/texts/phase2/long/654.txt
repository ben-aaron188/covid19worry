The situation across the company appears to be improving with the vaccine rollout, and lockdown leading to dropping cases.  There is a continued hope that we're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and that life is going to be able to start getting back to more normality as time progresses.  I feel that even when the Coronavirus situation has been dealt with/normalised its still going to leave a lasting effect on the way we live our lives - with a bigger focus on remote working, and time taken before people start to fully socialise normally.
