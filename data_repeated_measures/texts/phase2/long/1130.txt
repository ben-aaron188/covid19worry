At the moment, I'm not too concerned with COVID. I've been lucky enough to keep my job and work remotely. I've been able to stay at home and be safe. With so many people getting vaccinated, I feel hopeful. There's still a small amount of anxiety and fear I feel, but it's a lot less than at the beginning of the pandemic. I'm looking forward to being able to meet with friends again, to occasionally go back into the office and to be able to travel without fear. So overall, I feel happy, hopeful and at ease with the occasional bout of anxiety if I somehow find myself in a crowded space.
