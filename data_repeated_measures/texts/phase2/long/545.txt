Personally i feel ok. After being furloughed from April to September and being redundant for 1 month (October) I was able to find a new job and start it on November the 2nd. So previously I was sitting around all day with nothing to do but now I have a job that I can do from home which I am currently enjoying. 

It would be nice for things to return to normal but I would also like to continue working from home as I am quite liking the flexibility. And of course not having to commute every day is brilliant.
