I feel like the situation was coming under control with the issuing of vaccines, hence I was becoming less worried - however the current spike in cases has increased my fear of a repeat of last Summer, and has made me feel much more anxious about when we are going to finally get COVID fully under control. I feel safe and am not worried for myself in terms of catching corona, however I worry for people I know, in particular elderly family relatives who are much more likely to be affected by COVD. I feel slight annoyance at the Government for not having realised and acting sooner so that maybe we could have controlled the virus quicker and therefore come out of lockdown sooner.
