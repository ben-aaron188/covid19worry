I'm feeling just a bit depressed at the never-ending saga of the lockdown, and the frustrating feeling of restriction and helplessness.  Also weariness and mental tiredness of doing similar things every day and not wanting to go out anywhere to avoid people and awkward situations.  But also this is tempered with a glimmer of hope with the vaccines and possible improvement to come.  (Assuming the vaccines aren't a plot to kill us as well lol)!  This feels like I am being tested to the limits of my mental endurance but I realise it could be much worse if I actually had the virus and was in hospital.
