I’m sad about how many people have died and the livelihoods lost. I’m angry at the governments mishandling and hypocrisy. I’m bored of lockdown. I miss my friends and family. I’m keen for things to get back to normal. My young children have missed out on so much. I want a holiday. I want to be able to do things. I’m relieved that nobody I’m close to died. I’m grateful my in-laws have the vaccine. I’m gutted two places I liked going to have closed down. I’m looking forward to summer and the roadmap.
