I am feeling optimistic.  Both of my parents have had their first vaccine dose and will hopefully receive the second within the next month or two.  When they are vaccinated I will feel even more at ease.  For myself, my partner and I both had COVID back in November 2020, although it wasn't great I, fortunately, did not have any serious issues. I'm really looking forward to travelling abroad again possibly this summer if it becomes possible.  I am also looking forward to getting vaccinated but I am most wanting the older people to get both of their vaccinations.
