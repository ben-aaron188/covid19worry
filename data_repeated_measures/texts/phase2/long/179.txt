i feel i have come through the worst of corona situation and i cant wait to be able to escape the house ,and get back to some normality, I still feel anxious when there are too many people around me but to go to the hairdressers and meet my friends and go for a meal out, i just cant wait to see my parents without waving through a window and having a certain amount of freedom again.it wil be interesting to see how relaxed we can be without the lockdown and hopefully with the vaccine we should all be safer
