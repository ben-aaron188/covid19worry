I feel angry that we are still in a desperately sad situation over a year later after the initial outbreak. Certain decisions that needed to be made quickly where not, such as quarantining visitors to the UK. This annoys me greatly as we wouldn't have to be living with such extreme restrictions at this moment in time.  I also think we need to come down harder on those who are breaking the rules and not wearing masks without good reasons. Unless the person has a valid medical reason not wearing a mask should have a bigger fine that what it does now. I am also upset about my future as frankly I don't know how I am supposed to progress in my career and life when it is constantly being put on hold.
