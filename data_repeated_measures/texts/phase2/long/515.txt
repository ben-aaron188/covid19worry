I feel hope for the future and getting back to normal but have anxiety that new strains of the virus will delay things and poor uptake of the vaccine will also affect our progress. I also have concerns about the economy and worry for my son who is shortly to join the job market. I would dearly love to get back to doing some of the things I used to enjoy such as holidays and even just going for a coffee in a caf√©. I think the pandemic has polarised people and driven us apart rather than us having a shared fighting spirit.
