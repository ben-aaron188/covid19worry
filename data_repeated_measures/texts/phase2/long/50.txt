I feel a bit more relieved that the vaccine is being widely distributed and more and more people are getting vaccinating.  Things are gradually opening up and lockdown is easing.  I am more worried about adjusting to normal life again as it has been so long.  My daughter is back at school now which is a relief.  But i have  been quite content most of the time through lockdown.   But I must admit that i am older, it is the younger ones that i am most concerned about.  I will be really glad when the shops reopen, and it will be such a relief when we can eventually travel abroad, whenever that even might be,  I am quite excited to visit the cinema too, as I find it quite relaxing and enjoyable
