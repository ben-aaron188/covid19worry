Oh God I am so bored of the whole thing. I have just been talking to my band, with whom I have not been able to rehearse in a full year, and I miss them all so much. I also miss my family - particularly my mum, who died of Covid last April. And now I need to add some more characters because apparently I have not written enough, which would have been useful information earlier. Still not 500 characters? You don't want ""a few sentences"", you want War and bloody Peace. Character character character.
