Seeing how other countries with higher populations are coping better with the pandemic than the UK (through lower daily cases and deaths) makes me slightly annoyed at how complacent people are when they are asked to think of others and just stay at home. The government response, and that of the opposition has been shambolic, with the vaccine roll out vastly differing depending on where you live rather than your age / physical condition. This makes me anxious when people who are too selfish to follow sensible guidance could infect me or my family before I get a change for my vaccines.
