I am fed up with it. 2 months into another lockdown and i just want everything to return to normal. I miss a lot of normal things like going to the gym or the cinema. I miss sitting in a bar and enjoying my free time with my mates. I cant wait to take my kids out again to soft play areas and trampoline parks. I miss going on holiday the most, sitting at the beach with a strawberry daquiri or a sex on the beach. I miss taking a wee drive on a random day with a picnic. Everyboduly seems to be feeling the same.
