I feel that I have Extreme anxiety about the future. Also a fear of illness and catching things from people. I feel worried about what will happen in the future and how the world will be in the next year or so. I feel saddened and sorry about children's lives and how much its been effected.. And I'm also down about how my family haven't seen my baby yet, who is a year old.        

There is a slight feeling of hope that the vaccine will work and things will imprive but also just anxiety about everything
