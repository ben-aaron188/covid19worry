Anxious because I havn't had any work or income coming in apart from my pension. all our savings have been used up and I worry about how much longer it will be until I can get some work,Life is on hold at the moment. I'm waiting for my vaccine . I have had a letter telling me I could get an appointment online but each time I have tried the closest by miles to my home is also difficult to get to. I think that a few sunny days will help, I can escape out into the garden at least. A slower pace of life has been fine but being on a very tight budget when we had just started to be able to worry less about money is frustrating.
