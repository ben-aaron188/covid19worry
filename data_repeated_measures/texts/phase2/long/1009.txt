I am very annoyed about what is happening currently, I just want to be able to go back to living what is a normal life. Going out on a weekend, seeing friends, seeing family and just not having to be distanced from everyone I care about.

I am looking forward to hopefully the Summer being a relatively normal time when we are allowed back outside when most of the adult population in the United Kingdom has been vaccinated. Hopefully it will not take too much longer so that I can get back on with my life rather than just sitting stewing inside about how miserable everything is.
