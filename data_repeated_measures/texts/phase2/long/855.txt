I want things to return to normal now. We have endured this for a year and now people are being vaccinated. Im vaccinated and the risks are lower. We know more about the illness. It is time to find a way to live with the risks like we do the flu and live life again. I do not like the fact that we are being told constantly to stay at home when the risks are lower. I feel like I havent been living life for a year now. Just existing. Its time to stop living in fear. I would like to be able to see family again. People are being harassed for going out but the reality is people are congregating in the same areas because there is nothing open and nothing else to do. Which increases the risk in those areas. Businesses are failing and people are suffering financially. Im being told I cant go out of my local area and walk the hills but its ok to go to a local supermarket and be with 200 plus other people. It makes no sense.
