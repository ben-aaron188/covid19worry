I am angry at how badly the British government has managed the pandemic. I am anxious about going back to normal life, although, I would like some normality. I feel like I have had covid but it wasnâ€™t at the time when people could get a test and I feel like I now have long lasting effects from it. I am angry at the money that the British government have wasted even when they pretended before the pandemic that they did not have enough funding for other social issues such as helping the disabled and homeless.
