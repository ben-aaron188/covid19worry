I feel like we are nearly at the beginning of the end of the pandemic, but I recognise that we still have a long way to go before life gets back to normal. 
I am weary of working full time throughout the whole pandemic, it has been relentless and it is getting even harder as we need to maintain compliance with government guidelines.
I am long for gatherings with my whole family, going on holidays and having carefree days out.
I feel sorry for my youngest sister who is missing out on a crucial time in her social life, to develop and create new friendships with new people in her year at school.
I appreciate the simple things in life a lot more than before.
