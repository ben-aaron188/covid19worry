i am still worried about covid, i am slightly hopeful that the vaccines will help things get back to normal soon,  i want to be able to travel bt am worried about getting vaccine passports as no one seems to know how it will work, generally i feel more optimistic than a few months ago but i do still feel anxious.  i am still worried about another wave coming once people start to mix and i hope people will be sensible but i think as soon as shops open people will go crazy and forget about taking precautions
