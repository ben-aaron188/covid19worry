I am utterly fed up of it. I have been quite positive and happy throughout but it has taken a toll and I am done. My son was 1.5 years when this started and now heâ€™s 2.5 years old. He had changed dramatically in that time and my friends and family have missed that, plus his lack of interaction with children his own age, affecting his development, is heartbreaking. I think the roadmap is unrealistic and find it hard to believe that we will be all done with everything by June 21st. We have been given false expectations plenty of times so far so why should this one be any different.
