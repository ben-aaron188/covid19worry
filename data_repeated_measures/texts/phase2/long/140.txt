I feel positive, that life will go back to normal again. There is a sadness that it is impossible to visit loved ones who live abroad, as the cost is so high for average income family. I am disappointed that secondary children need to wear masks at school, even the government saying is voluntary and advisory but school don't agree with that option. Feels like there is no choice is the child wants to go back. Suddenly there are no more other illnesses, flu, pneumonia, meningitis is not killing anyone this year as it was before. The common cold is gone as soon as you got sniffle or cough it is a coronavirus. Tests in the workplace, no freedom whatsoever, you either do the test and earn money or starve at home.
It feels wrong to test healthy people without any simptoms. 
before cleaning ears with ear buds was a no, no and now everyone is poking themselves in the nose and their kids twice a week with cotton buds and saying that this is healthy and normal. is it?
