its getting a bit over the top now i think we should just live with it and get on with our lives, you cant belive anything people tell you the death rate is not totally true we have wasted a year of our lives now and we dont know if its done any good or not we will never know but the economy need to get started again before there is more people without a job fingers crossed we are over the worse and life hopefully will get back to a little normality and can hopefully get on a plane and go abroad
