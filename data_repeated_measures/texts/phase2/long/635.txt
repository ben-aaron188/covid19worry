I'm more confused about it than I was last year. I've seen more and more information from others on social media that it's fake and it's time to open up again. I've also spoken with others who aren't going to have the vaccine. I will have the vaccine, although worry about it making me ill in the short term. I worry about the talk of vaccine passports, whilst I can see the benefit for protecting the vulnerable. There is enough division in the world already with apparent black vs white; men vs women; rich vs poor. It just seems to be something else that may divide the population. Which makes me sad. I wish everyone could respect others opinions without the violence and everything else that goes with it.
