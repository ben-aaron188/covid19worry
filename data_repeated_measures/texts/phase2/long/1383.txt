I'm starting to feel very worried about the secondary impacts of the pandemic and not the pandemic perse. I am really struggling to progress my career. My son in particular has missed out on so much. I am also so sad that my family have missed out on my baby daughter growing up. Its just so sad that I cant see my family.
All of this has left me frustrated and if I think about it too much really sad and down. Ive stuck to the rules and life is v dull.
I honestly cant believe that  this had been happening for a year now. I dont believe the june 21st date but Id be happy if we could go back to normal!
