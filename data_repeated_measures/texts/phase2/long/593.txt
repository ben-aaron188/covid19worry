I feel pretty optimistic about the current situation in the uk regarding corona virus. With easing of restrictions on the horizon and a decline in cases and hospitalisations I feel happier now than I have for the past few months. I have had my vaccine and my husband should have his in the next few months we can look forward to the future. Iâ€™m looking forward to booking a holiday abroad and also to seeing my family and being able to go to a restaurant for a nice meal with my family. It will be good for my son to get back to college, he has ASD and the lockdowns have had a negative effect on him and his mental health, he will be glad to get back to a routine that he enjoys.
