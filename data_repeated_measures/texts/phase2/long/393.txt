I feel very frustrated and fed up. I miss my family and “normal” life. I am losing all interest in doing anything I enjoy and feel lazy all the time as a result of no motivation. I am anxious about how the situation will play out in the next few months but feel extremely anxious about things opening up again because I feel like cases will rise again, but there will be an expectation for me to return to “normal” - back to the office, shops busy again etc. I don’t feel ready for that. There are some things I am looking forward to like seeing my family. I feel very alone and more so because I am feeling such a lack of motivation to do anything. All I do is watch tv because anything else seems too much effort and my brain feels like it’s not really working. I am angry at the situation because I was made redundant and I hate my new job but I am stuck in it because I cannot afford to leave. I feel very miserable and low
