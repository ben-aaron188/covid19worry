It seems to be getting better. The weather has brightened up with spring, so it's nice to be able to spend more time outside again. Vaccinations are going well, so hopefully we will be able to come out of lockdown and lift restrictions by Summer. Looking forward to seeing friends and family again, and being able to spend a bit of time away from home (break from everyday life). Will be nice to be able to socialise, go out to for meals/drinks, and even meet up for coffee! I'm feeling very hopeful about the future.
