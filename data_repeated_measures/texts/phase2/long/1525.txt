I feel anxious that this is the beginning of the end in terms of social stability and that the escalating climate crisis means there will be constant and worsening challenges like this. I feel frustrated that people do not take it seriously and angry at government and vested interests who worry about profit first. I feel anxious that I might get ill and die and leave my daughter an orphan. I hope that the imminent loosening of restrictions might be positive, but fear it will be fleeting. I feel anxious that I'm not sure how my working life will be when working from home is less enforced.
