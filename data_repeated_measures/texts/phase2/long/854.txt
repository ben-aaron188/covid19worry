I feel like this has gone on way too long, initially we were told it would be 3-6 weeks lockdown, but realistically knowing it would be around 2 months lockdown. It's now just shy of a year on and if you don't take into consideration the vaccine, we're no better off than we were this time last year. Thank god for the vaccine! I feel lockdowns are a total waste of time and just delay the inevitable. I do feel because of the vaccine that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel but my main worries are my about my job.
