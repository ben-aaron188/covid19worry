I'm extremely tired of being home all day, I'm tired of having my university experience being robbed and having pre-recorded lectures as an alternative, while still paying full price of the tuition fees, I'm tired of not having any motivation besides wanting to sleep through this until it's over, I'm tired of this routine of doing the same things for pretty much an entire year, now. I just want it to end at this point. It's been more than a year since I've last hang out with a friend or do something social, no person should live like this, the damage this has caused to my mental health is probably something I won't fully notice it until this is over, I spent my birthday this year alone looking at a computer screen. I'm fed up with how university still asks the students to have the same level of productivity, ignoring the whole going-on situation, as if this doesn't affect anyone, as if it is okay to consistently fail the students delivering proper education to the expected level, and pretend everything is normal as it is. Besides, the Corona situation having entirely messed up with any possible plans for the next years, the major anxiety of not knowing how things will turn out is not only crushing, but dis-motivating to the point of causing the naive hope of any decent future to die out and completely prevents any possible course of action, the previous generations won't know how this will feel because most of them already had their lives planned out, but will expect each and every one of us to be on our best behavior and everything about that makes me disgusted, this system is hell.
