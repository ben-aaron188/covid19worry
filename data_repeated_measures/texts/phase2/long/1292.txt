I have been really heartened by the vaccine roll-out and the fall in cases nationwide. It definitely feels like there's light at the end of the tunnel. I just hope that things still go in the right direction as we start to open up society again, particularly with schools opening next week; I definitely don't want another lockdown. I'm starting to plan meet-ups with my family again, which I haven't been even contemplating for a very long time. I feel fortunate to have not been overly affected personally by the pandemic.
