At the moment I feel quite calm however I do feel anxious being stuck at home sometimes, it makes me feel trapped. I'm running out of things to do at home and life is very repetitive. I'm looking forward to the next couple of months when things start to ease again and I can hopefully go back to work. I also hope that we will be able to meet up with family soon, it's been way too long and I wish we locked down earlier last year. Things may have been different now. I am trying to stay positive about the longer days and nicer weather coming, this means more evening walks. I do slightly worry about socialising again as it's been a year since I've spoke to a lot of people.
