even though the figures of new cases and deaths are coming down daily I still feel anxious surrounding being near other people. I am happy that lots of the older and at risk members of the public have now had their first vaccine. I am uneasy about the figures rising again once the schools re open on Monday. Hopefully the new cases will continue to fall and the shops will be allowed to re open and this awful virus is starting to fade away. Life getting back to normal is what everyone wants but I do feel that maybe the shops re opening in April is going to be pushed back a few weeks to make sure we are all safe. Our lives are more important than the economy but I do understand that the economy is extremely important for our country too.
