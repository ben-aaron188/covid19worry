Im mostly upset and saddened by the government putting profits before people, wanting everyone to be vaccinated (including children) and it all being based on skewed stats.
 I'm disgusted at the media blocking alternative views and the public from blindly swallowing everything they are fed.
 As someone is is not old or fat, I am angry about vaccination passports and that we can be controlled so easily and willingly.
 I am saddened that ive been imprisoned in my home for over 2% of my life and that voices like mine are not and never will be listened to, taken seriously or are set only to be that of tinfoil hat wearing anti-vaxers (which they aren't)
