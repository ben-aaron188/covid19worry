I mostly feel sleepy, i've just had dinner and it's nearly bedtime. i'm pretty happy mostly, fairly settled in lockdown but looking forward to getting out again. 

In terms of the Corona situation, I am hopeful that the vaccines will start to curb transmission, but worried that total vaccine deployment will not be sufficient and that just-vaccinated people are letting their guard down. I feel jealous that people who are apparently ahead of me in the queue getting vaccinated, especially when they don't appear to follow the rules at all or take care of their health in other ways, but i am still glad that the population is getting vaccinated.
