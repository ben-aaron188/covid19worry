Confused and conflicted. Overwhelmed and past caring. Anxious and resigned. Deeply angry and disgusted by the government's behaviour, greed and corruption. Full of compassion for anyone who has to cope with the consequenses of Covid. Fatalistic.
I had my first jab yesterday. In the evening I had side-effects of very strong shivers and aches. A fitful night. Today I feel fragile. Someone told me the after-effects are worse with the second jab. 
The same person said they would have the vaccination; they distrust the information given and are wary of the lack of time over testing. They are sceptical of the Covid deaths numbers. This person owns a care home. 
The vaccination centre was so well organised and everyone was kind and helpful, I was impressed. Now, I find myself wondering if it's all a stage set. 
Throughout the pandemic, my motivation has been to stay out of hospital; to not add to the workload; to help the NHS and to look after myself. I didn't clap for carers - I think they should all be paid properly. The 1% payrise announced today is so depressing, mean, corrupt, greedy. I  can't help but loathe this government and all the people in power who are self-serving. I am angry.
