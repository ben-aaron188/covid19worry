it has now become the new normal and most people have adjusted. the relaxation of lockdown measures and the vaccination programmes provide some hope that normal life may resume soon, therefore, compared to last year I am more hopeful. being able to go  back to university and having distractions has also helped me forget about the extent of the situation at points. i still feel anger and resentment towards the government for not handling the situation better, and letting the situation get worse again when scientists had provided predictions and there were ways of reducing the amount of people that died.
