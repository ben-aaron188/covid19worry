I generally feel relaxed and hopeful for a brighter future for myself and the world ingeneral.  I feel relived that vaccines are helping the situation, but still a bit apprehensive that the virus could still be c around and having an effect for some times to come. A at some times I feel better but if ib  are e the news reports they can some times have a negative effect on how i am feeling at that particular time. There is nothing more i can say this covers my feelings on this issue completely.
