I am unhappy that the government has not helped the many recently self employed who have slipped through the net.

I am furious that there was no real long held actionable plan for a pandemic ready to be deployed by the government, this should have been planned for and in place for 30+ years not made up on the moment.

I am sad that my young children have been unable to see family, indeed our newborn has only met grandparents during Christmas and has never met my siblings.

My oldest child has missed out on education oppurtunities that have unfortunately held back her learning. She has speech problems and mixing with other children would have greatly improved the situation.

I am happy that the vaccination program has progressed quickly and that we may soon be able to live more normally.
