As a clinically extremely vulnerable person I have a lot of anxiety about the virus. However, I just received my 2nd vaccine today and hope that helps.

I would feel better if things were slowed down - I don't think we are ready to move forward yet.

I have nothing else to say. But I'm not hitting 500 characters so cannot proceed. Therefore there will not be any useful information below this. Not sure what else I can add.

I worry about my relatives too - my sister is reluctant to have the vaccine unless it can be completed in the initially recommended period of 3 weeks.
