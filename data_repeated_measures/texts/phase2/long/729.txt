I am very anxious. We had to postpone our wedding last year and are now trying to organise it again for our new date this year, knowing that it could all be cancelled again. The last year feels like an absolute waste of time and it makes me really sad. I am upset and angry that so many people STILL don’t follow the rules, and I find it unbelievable that some people still thinks it’s all a scam. It’s ridiculous and makes me so frustrated and angry. I desperately want things to return to ‘normal’ and feel like I have cabin fever, but I know how important it is to keep going and get on top of the virus.
