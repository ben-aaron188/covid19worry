I feel that I am in a strange place at the moment with the current Corona situation.  I feel that we are approaching the home run and that things will get back to normal again to some extent this year.  Though I have found this winter lockdown really challenging on my mental health.  That worries me a lot, having inappropriate anxiety is something that is kind of new to me.  I feel there is some hope with the vaccine but I am also a bit hesitant to take it when I am called as I had a severe reaction to the flu vax over 20 years ago.   The nights are getting lighter and spring is approaching though I still feel anxious about the future what with new variants being found also do we really know what all the side effects of these vaccines.
