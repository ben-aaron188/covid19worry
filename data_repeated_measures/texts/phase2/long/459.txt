I feel hope that the vaccines are here but I still fear going outside. I miss my friends a lot and it’s starting to grate. I’m irrational and irritable and I lash out at people. I want to be out and I want this stupid virus to be gone. I want to be able to travel. Or move where I want. I fear what we’ve lost thus year. Will we ever get it back. Working from home has been okay, the technology has always been there. I hope it can carry on being used. If we are out of this in 3 months, I hope we can still have a year to remember
