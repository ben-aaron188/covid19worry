I am a bit fed up of everything now my work and home life has been effected I just want life back how it was. I understand why we have had lengthily lock downs but I think only the elderly should shelter and we should look after them with shopping etc until they’ve received the second vaccination. It’s causing me stress at work and at home now and I can’t wait for restrictions to lift just to take my little boy out for the day! He is almost 2 and can’t remember what it’s like to play with friends at soft play or to hug his grandparents which is really sad
