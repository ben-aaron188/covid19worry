I feel concerned and angry about other peoples actions. People have been stupid and selfish, carrying the virus with out symptoms thinking it doesn't effect them. I'm scared to go out, even for a walk or exercise. I'm hopeful that things will soon be safe but have no faith or trust in other people. I've had the first vaccine and it made me extremely ill for 4 days and has made me even more scared of Coronavirus. But I am looking forward to hopefully being able to see my friends again as I have felt very isolated and alone for the last year.
