I am a little less anxious having gone this far without me or any of my immediate family catching it and becoming very ill. I myself have now had a vaccination so I am less worried about myself now. But my son is back at school next week so I am a little apprehensive about that. He suffers from Autism and doing a COVID-19 test twice a week I feel will be a strain on him. He hasnâ€™t been out in weeks and I feel he will be very anxious going back to school now. My eldest son has been working all through this lockdown so I am less concerned about him plus he is now 19.
