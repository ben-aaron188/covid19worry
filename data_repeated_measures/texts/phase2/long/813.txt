I feel disappointed that nearly a whole year of my life and my family's life has been taken away by Coronavirus as we have not been able to do any of the things we wanted to do in 2020. I am sad that our life has changed so much but optimistic about the future. I hope my daughter will not have been too badly affected by the pandemic. I am also excited about returning to work in a normal phase and not continuing to work from home every day. I am grateful for the extra time I have been able to spend with my loved ones close to me and also happy that we have been able to take stock of certain things in our life and maybe complete projects that normally would have taken years, such as a garden landscape.
