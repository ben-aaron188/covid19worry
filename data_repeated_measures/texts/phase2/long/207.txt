I feel worn down by the situation,  it feels never ending and i am missing seeing my family properly.  I am grateful,  however,  that the UK is in a good position with the vaccination programme and this at least creates hope ..... i just want to give my elderly parents a hug and im counting down until they have had their 2nd dose of the vaccine and we can be a family again. Some family's have had a terrible time suffering terrible grief. The pandemic has showed good characteristics of humanity,  eg Capt Tom Moore
