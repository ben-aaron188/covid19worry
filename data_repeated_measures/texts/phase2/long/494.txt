At the minute I am feeling very positive about the number of people being vaccinated. I am very hopeful that we will be able to stick to the roadmap that the prime minister has set us, and that things will be nearly back to normal by the end of June. My main concern is the affect all of this will have on the arts industry as it has been closed for so long, I hope the government can help them get back on their feet as I don't think people realise how much the world needs the arts. I am looking forward to being able to get the vaccine so I can personally feel like I am moving ahead towards a more 'normal' life.
