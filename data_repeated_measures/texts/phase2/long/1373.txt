Sad at the time wasted and lives lost. 
Hopeful for the vaccines and the lifting of restrictions. 
Angry at the ineffective response of the government and the delays and damage this has caused,  in terms of lives lost, jobs lost and businesses destroyed.
Worried about the effects that schools reopening will have on the infection rate.
Looking forward to seeing family and friends again later in the year, hoping that it is safe for us to meet again soon.
Relieved that my family and friends have so far come through this without serious illness.
