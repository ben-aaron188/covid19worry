I am feeling tired, fed up, lonely burnt out and anxious about the whole thing, especially as it's now been a year since the start of the pandemic - this means my second birthday in lockdown will be in a few weeks, and last year I definitely wasn't expecting two lockdown birthdays! However I am optimistic that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel and grateful that I and my loved ones are alive and healthy. I'm also a bit worried about whether the world has changed forever and that things will never be the same again.
