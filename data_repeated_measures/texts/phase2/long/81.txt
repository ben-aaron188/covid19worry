I am really bored of the whole thing and consider now to be the right time to start quickly lifting all restrictions. I want my old life back as the seasonal virus has almost gone for now. I hate how the government is treating us all and consider that it to be far to cautious. So many people have now been vaccinated that it is time to open up. Get the children back to school, get the shops open, and get hospitality up and running. Save the economy else generations to come will suffer under the mountain of debt.
