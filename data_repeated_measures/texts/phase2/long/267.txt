I am very anxious about the pandemic and the effect of my industry. As a performer there is nearly no work for us at the moment. To make matters worse I am a performer on a cruise Ship, so both the travel and entertainment industries are two of the worst hit by the pandemic. With a lot of companies going into adminstration. I am very nervous I is a long time without work, and without any support from the government. 
I am also very scared for some of the older people in my family and what would happen if they got it.
