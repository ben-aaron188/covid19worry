I am frustrated at having to be at home for this long and want to be able to socialise. I am annoyed at how it has been handled over the year and just want to be able to go outside again. I think the lockdown has gone on long enough and while I was taking it very seriously at the start i am now at the end of my patience with being stuck indoors all this time. My mental health has not been the best due to this and I cannot wait until I am allowed to go back out and socialise and chill with my friends and life goes back to normal.
