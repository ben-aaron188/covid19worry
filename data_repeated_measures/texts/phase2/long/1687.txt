I feel sad thinking about all the things I have missed out on in the last year being stuck at home and not being able to go anywhere. It has affected my child's development greatly and he has missed out on so many opportunities. I haven't been able to see my friends and family for nearly 1 year now, we were due to go abroad to see my in-laws but had to cancel this. It makes me sad to think that they haven't seen my son yet and are not too well at the moment, I hope we are able to go back before their health deteriorates.
