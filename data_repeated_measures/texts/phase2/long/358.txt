From the beginning of this pandemic i have been anxious about it, i am worried for my and my families' health as well as the fear of job losses.    At this point I feel very tired and sad of the situation but get annoyed at how things have been handle by the Government and press.  Some people i know haven't taken the situation seriously and this attitude has worried my greatly as I feel I am trying my best but other people do not.  I can see their point when people in power can do what they like so they feel ""why should I bother?""  When you are around these types of people it becomes depressing as it makes you feel that what you do doesn't matter and that they don't care how their behaviour affects others.
