At the moment, I feel fed up with the Corona situation. It has been going on for too long and I feel that we should be allowed some more normal life back now that a lot of the vunerable are vaccinated. Covid-19 has made life very boring but I do feel a lot less scared about it now then I did last March as my sister who is on the shielding list and my parents have all been vaccinated. 

I feel less anxious when out and about working and doing shopping but I am still extremely careful and keep my distance and wear my mask. I have hope that the situation will greatly improve as more and more are vaccinated and I hope of some normal life soon. I dream of the day that we don't need to wear masks and can go where we want when we want.
