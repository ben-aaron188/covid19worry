At the moment I feel positive about the future. With the UK vaccination program going well and kids now going back to school I feel that we will get back to some sort of normality soon. There now seems to be some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and that restrictions will soon end. Iâ€™m looking forward to being able to see family and friends again and for the summer to be easier. I am a little concernes about the variants that seem to be emerging. Also nest winter is a concern with virus rates possible going up again.
