I am fed up with the politicians, grieving the unnecessary deaths, fearful that something will go wrong with the vaccines or the vaccination programme, and resigned to having to go on enduring the restrictions on my behaviour. I feel as though I have done my best for such a long time and that I have been let down by the politicians and their sloppy incompetence which has prolonged this crisis. For some time now I have been fantasising about emigrating to New Zealand and if I could I would seriously consider leaving this country although I would miss it a great deal.
