I feel like it took too much for us to go into lockdown, which meant that it spread a lot more. The government also failed to recognise that opening schools would spread it a lot more and making the situation worse. This was then proved through the cases and deaths sky rocketing, which the government, once again, failed to recognise. There are also very ignorant people who still don't believe that covid-19 is real and think the government are trying to control them. Thankfully, the vaccine is being distributed to everyone at the moment, and, hopefully, the vaccine prevents the spread of corona virus.
