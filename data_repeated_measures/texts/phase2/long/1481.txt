I am feeling burnt out and in desperate need of a change of scenery. I am hoping that virus levels will continue to fall so that lockdown measures can be relaxed and I can take my children to the woods or the beach. They need it for their mental health.  My family and I have stuck to every lockdown rule set and we are finding it increasingly frustrating seeing people break these rules - especially when we have sacrificed so much. I am trying to feel optimistic for the future but when I can receive the vaccine seems a long time away.
