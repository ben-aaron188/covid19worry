I feel very worried about the full reopening of schools on Monday. I feel that it is too soon, and that the government should be aiming for an elimination approach. I am fearful that other Covid variants will be given the opportunity to emerge, rendering our vaccines useless. I am very disappointed with our government for the way that theyâ€™ve handled this pandemic.  I wish I lived in New Zealand or had a Jacinda in charge of our government. Still, our controls over people travelling into and out of the country are too lax. To hear that nurses have been given a measly 1% pay rise after all of the work they have done throughout this pandemic, causing danger to both their physical and mental health, is appalling.
