I really feel annoyed by all this situation with coronavirus. 
Last year past so quickly and I wasn't able to enjoy my life, because everything was so limited. I feel so separated from my family and friends. I wish everything will back to normal soon.
It looks like I only work, spend time at home and do essential shopping twice a week. That all became so boring and repetitive.
I feel like now is time to start enjoying simple little things like clothes shopping, dinner with friends in restaurant, cinema time , bowling again.
