I think we have reached the position that we have, through good government control along with more folks obeying the rules than the idiots who have not. This is clearly reflected in current infection figures, along with vaccination levels. To say that we are the enemy of Europe is putting it mildly. Brexit has played its part and to think that we might have remained and joined  the EU medical programme is quite frankly worrying. This has allowed me to feel relaxed about potential impacts of covid on my self and my wife going forward
