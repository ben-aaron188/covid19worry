I feel it's been going on for too long and that everything should be open and back to normal as it is having a bad effect on people's mental health and some of this damage will take years to heal especially the younger generation and their future prospects. I hope that they will not be any further lockdowns and that people can meet their loved ones. I feel as this has gone on for too long and alot of damage has been done in terms of people accessing health care and other services. It is really frustrating for alot if people now
