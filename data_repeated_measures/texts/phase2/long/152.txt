I feel sad that the career that i have worked so hard for has been taken away due to restrictions placed by coronavirus. Even though I agree wholeheartedly with the restrictions and feel that people are being too cavalier with meeting up and doing what they want to do regardless of the risk it places on other people, I still wish that the restrictions weren't there.  I feel anxious that I don't know what to do if i can't regain the professional standing that I had beforehand. I feel sad that I can't spend time with my family. I feel trapped in my small flat and unable to travel anywhere. I feel very anxious about the future and feel that time is running away from me but everything is staying the same and I feel powerless to do anything about it.
