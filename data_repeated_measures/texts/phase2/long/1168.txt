I largely feel more hopeful about the corona situation. The statistics look promising â€“ it appears as if the vaccine programme is working well and the UK numbers have rapidly fallen over the lockdown period. I've been fortunate to have already received my first jab (far earlier than I expected for my age and the level of my asthma). I'm still being super cautious and have been living like I'm in lockdown for pretty much a year and feel lucky to be able to continue doing so until after my second dose. I'd still be afraid of contracting the virus right now, do worry about whether there's going to be another big variant bombshell in time, and also for others re jobs etc.
