I don’t feel as worried about it as I was this time last year because there is a vaccine available and this is being distributed quite fast across the United Kingdom. I’m angry that the government have not handled this in a good way because it has been a whole year since the first lockdown and other countries such as New Zealand and Australia are covid free because they handled it a lot better. More than anything I am desirable for this to end so that normal life can resume and I can spend time with my family
