At the moment I feel what I'm doing to keep myself safe from the coronavirus Is working and the public safety measures currently in place, make me feel more  relaxed about the situation but still aware of what's happening.

Staying home doesn't bother me at all because I did that before the pandemic anyway, I'm just more bored, so I struggle to find something to keep me busy so I usually sleep during the day.

To stop the boredom I got  another job in a supermarket which was fine before the second lockdown but then people started to come in for a day out in large groups and not conforming to social distancing rules which Is annoying.
