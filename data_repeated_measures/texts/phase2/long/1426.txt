It’s ever evolving- one day there’s hope and the next sorrow. I hdvr never been personally affected by it but know many people that have. My fear is that this will become as normal as the flu and well always be taking about it. So bored of taking about it. I feel like it affects other people but not me. Happy about his far we’ve come with treatments and vaccine but then again so far to go. Compared to last year I feel run down just thinking about it last year I was hopeful it would be over soon
