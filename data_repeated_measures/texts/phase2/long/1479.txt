I am angry that it has been allowed to go on for so long. I am angry I have wasted a year of my life through governement and SAGE incompetence. I am angry that although there are thousands of respected scientists who have said we could have done everything differently they were never nced listened to because for the government to admit that would mean losing face. I forgive the reaction a year ago but within weeks most sensible people could see whilst this was a pandemic, it wasnt on the scale that it was reacted to. i saw with great sadness today on the news schoolchildren being taught how to take Corona tests and I was sickened to my stomach at the sight of this. There has been so much unecessary expense, effort not to mention the extra deaths that are coming down the line due to missed diagnosis and treaments, nto to mention the poverty when furlough ends and a million people are laid off, if not more. This must never be allowed ot happen again and there needs to be impartial enquiries with each death investigated as to whether c19 was their cause of death as we all know the vast majority died of other things. And when this data comes out and the mistake is revealed, no less than jail time should be meted out to Johnson Hancock, Whittey and all the others. i have already decided that unless there is a massive shake up I will never vote again. My faith in this government and this country as a whole (due to the stasi like orders to snitch and the bickering over distancing and masks etc) has never been at a lower point.
