Very ready for things to reopen and extremely tired of being in the house, lots of anxiety surrounding adjusting going back into society but also anger about losing a year of life with very little to look back on. Lots of tension in the household after being inside for a year and built up anger from everybody. Little fear about covid anymore due to very low amount of cases in my area and with now lots of hope from the vaccine, however the vaccine rollout still could have been planned better thus quicker
