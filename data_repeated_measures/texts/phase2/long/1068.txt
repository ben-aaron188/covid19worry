I am looking forward to the very near future that I can meet family and friends and start getting back to normal. I am very hopeful that the situation will get better with vaccinations. I am proud of the NHS that they have managed to carry out all these vaccinations in a short amount of time. My children are going back to school next week and I am abit anxious as to how they will get on; hopefully they will slot right back into some sort of routine. I personally am looking forward to going round to my dads and spending quality time with him. So much has happened this year; I have been redeployed twice and i an actually abit anxious about going back to my normal job!
