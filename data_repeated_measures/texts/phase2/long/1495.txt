Both myself and my husband have had the first covid vaccination and that gives me piece of mind and i am looking forward to part 2...the UK government are hoping to open the country up completely June 22nd and i am really looking forward to it. Cases and deaths are going down week by week and i am just fearful another variant of covid will come along that the vaccine does not protect.I have been off work for two months now due to the lockdown and i work in education but the latest news i have heard is i will be reurning to my duties on March 15th something again i feel i need to go back to s soon as possible
