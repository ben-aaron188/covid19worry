I am happy now we have a lockdown exit strategy it gives much more hope! My nan and grandad have had their first vaccines which is brill, they had no side effects either! I’m feeling a bit more positive now about the world as a whole and that we can all get through this! I can’t wait to get back to work and in to a routine and go to the gym again, not long to wait! I also get to actually celebrate my birthday outside the house this year, as the pubs reopen so I can have a lovely meal out and a couple of drinks, exiting times!!!
