It was fine until this current lockdown. Now I feel detached from my family and just want it to be over. As the schools reopen, it feels like the restrictions are being lifted and nobody really cares about the risk. I see parents having chats on the playground and not social distancing.  I’m fully aware that the risks are still there however it’s been going on for so long now that I’m willing to handle the risks. I just want life to go back to normal. COVID has taught me the value of seeing friends and family that I won’t take for granted any more.
