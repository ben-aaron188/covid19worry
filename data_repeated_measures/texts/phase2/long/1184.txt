Sadness and guilt for not being able to see friends and family, and worried that when we are able to if it will be safe.
Anger about the people flaunting the rules and meeting up.

Looking forward to the next few months when things are lifted more.
Worried about the affect on my children through this missing out on important school time and social time. Anxiety that this will affect them long term as it is already showing in their day to day life. Nervous about the vaccine and possible side effects.
Hope for the future
