At this moment, I do not feel concerned about the corona situation for myself or my family, in terms of the virus as my father has been vaccinated who is the only person I have been concerned about contracting the virus. However, I am concerned for the general public, especially those who are at greater risk of life-threatening consequences. 

I feel quite lucky to be in the position I am in. I have felt anxious and nervous in the past but I have become accustomed to the situation, the idea of being able to go back to normal life makes me feel excited and nervous at the same time.
