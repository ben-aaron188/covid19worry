I feel relieved, nothing bad has personally happened to me or my family yet and hopefully, nothing will. I'm proactively trying to make the best of the situation by participating in a variety of courses to boost my CV for example coding, digital marketing, software. It's also nice to have time off doing nothing- makes me more relaxed, calm and satisfied, through this I've spent more time cooking which is a great hobby and I really seem to enjoy it. Plus, having time is good when searching for a career.
