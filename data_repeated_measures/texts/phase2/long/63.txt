I, and my husband have had the first vaccination and it was a joyous moment. Those waiting with us at the venue were eager and happy too. Today our daughter was invited for her jab tomorrow and that makes us feel relief. Our son is a teacher and he will be vaccinated on Tuesday (as a carer of his wife with CF). In the wider world, I fear the reopening of schools next week may allow cases to rise and I am nervous of that. But overall I feel safer and look forward tentatively to some resumption of normal life.
