I really feel a bit happier that things are a bit better than say over the last Christmas period. Consequently, I think that recognisable improvements will be seen with increasing frequency as the vaccines take hold & immunity in the population builds up. That makes me feel more hopeful than I have been since it all started. I don't think we'll be completely free of its effects for a while however, if at all. That makes me feel apprehensive about what problems it could still cause. Additionally, looking back from the current time, the sheer amount of heartache, pain & death Coronavirus has caused makes me feel somehow very frustrated and monumentally sad. I almost can't process just the amount of negativity it makes me feel really.
