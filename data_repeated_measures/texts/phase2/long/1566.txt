Although I’m still quite anxious I don’t feel scared though, as I can suffer from anxiety in general life anyway, it’s just more heightened now because of t the pandemic. However I am trying to keep positive and hopefully that the end is near or normality may resume in the near future now there is a guideline as to when things may be begin to re open but at the same time still remaining realistic as the past year as taught me things may not go to plan. This will hopefully reduce my anxiety caused by having the same repetitive routine day in day out for the past 12 months.
