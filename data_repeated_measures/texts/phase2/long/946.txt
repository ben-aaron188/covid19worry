I am very sad about the number of deaths. Worried that it might get worse again. That the vaccine will not protect us from a new strain. 
Itâ€™s been very hard not to see all my friends and family. I still have a room full of Christmas presents for my niece and nephew. 
Fingers crossed this time will be the last lockdown as it has felt a lot harder this time around. 
I work in a school and it is a bit worrying for Monday having all children back at once but again fingers crossed this will be ok. 
I have MS and I was only diagnosed just before the first lockdown and I was not able to go on the best treatment as at the time they did not know the risks. For a while I had to move out of my home as my partner was working everyday and had to use public transport and this was not safe for me. This was very hard and upsetting.
