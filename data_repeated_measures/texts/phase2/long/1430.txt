I've been vaccinated, as have my older parents whom I live with, so I'm feeling hopeful for the future. Variants of the virus are a concern, of course, and the government's endless bungling (border control!), but I don't think a happier summer is completely unlikely. I do have phases of feeling sadder or isolated, in balance with any cheeriness, and reading the news never helps with this, yet I can't help but scroll...

I work in public health so I'm acutely aware of my local situation but this is another cause for hope; I can see things are much better than they were in January simply from the number of outbreak control teams we have to convene. The workload remains humongous though, and many of us have lived and breathed covid for over a year now. We can't burnout because who else is there to do the job, but I do feel fatigue will set in at some point.
