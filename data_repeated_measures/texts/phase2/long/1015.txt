I feel that the situation is improving, but so did I after the other lockdowns, Iâ€™m just not sure what is going to happen next, I just want life to return to normal so that I can be with my friends and have fun.

Also I am uncertain about the new strains of coronavirus and that they may cause us to go into another lockdown, I am also unsure about the effectiveness of the vaccines a gain at these new strains, especially with some of them being able to evade the bodies immune system. 

I also have concerns about going on holiday,as I want to relieve a lot of stress, but unfortunately I am unsure whether we will be able to travel any time soon, I just want to leave my house to be brutally honest.
