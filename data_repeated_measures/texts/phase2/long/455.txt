I feel like nobody is taking it seriously anymore, nobody keeps their distance, some people still don't wear masks, everyone goes out everywhere yet we're only meant to be out for essential stuff. It makes me so anxious and doesn't help when I have to work throughout it too, at a place which isn't essential in the slightest and where people come in JUST for a scratchcard. It's a joke to be honest. I've had enough of it and now a date has been given for when all restrictions can be lifted, people are acting like coronavirus will have evaporated by then. It's wrong.
