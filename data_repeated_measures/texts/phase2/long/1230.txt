It has been handled abysmally. The UK government is a waste of space and with the constant lifting and locking down, it's been made much worse. Plus a huge group of the population are going to be stuck waiting for vaccines while other groups are able to travel and go on holiday. There is no logic or planning in any of this. It's shown how unequipped we are to handle any kind of outbreak and has ramifications on the economy that are going to be felt for years to come. It's been a year of waiting and worrying, barely being able to leave the house with all of the risks happening. None of this would need to apply if we'd done what Greenland, Australia and New Zealand did and actually planned and acted like there was a lethal airborne virus going around.
