I hope the situation will improve very soon, due to the global vaccination effort. When this started, I didn't think it would affect me so much because I was able to (luckily) retain my job, and I was not an outgoing person to enjoy outdoors anyway. However, after a year, I can see that it has taken a toll on my and my family's mental health. What is especially daunting is the fact that I cannot travel internationally to meet my parents. I am also concerned about the increased incidents of racism against people of Asian descent.
