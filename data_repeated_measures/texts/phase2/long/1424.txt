I'm mostly angry about the seemingly endless corruption and mishandling of the Covid response in the UK. This is paired with a deep sense of frustration and hopelessness at the political class who seem to be able to act with impunity. There's an anger at divisions that have formed in relationships with friends who have taken a polar opposite opinion of the crisis, and a deep sense of dissapointment at how opinions and behaviour have been dangerously manipulated.
I'm also a little nervous about things returning to normal as I've grown accustomed to the routines and restrictions we currently have. As someone with anxiety, the thought of social pressures returning is giving me frayed nerves.
