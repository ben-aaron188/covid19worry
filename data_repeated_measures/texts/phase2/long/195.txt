I feel very anxious about the lockdown restrictions being lifted and life returning to how it was pre pandemic. I have body confidence issues and self esteem issues as well as social anxiety about having to be going back out into the real world and having to perform as I did before the pandemic took hold. I am still worried about my family members or myself contracting the virus but I feel hopeful that the vaccination programme will help, even if I do feel a bit apprehensive and unsure about the effectiveness of the vacine.
