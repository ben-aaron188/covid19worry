As a teacher, life has not changed much. We are still working and welcoming all children back in on Monday, this is worrying as I donâ€™t know what I will be coming in to contact with and then bringing home to my family. My parents look after my children while I work so I do not want to put them in any danger. My sister lives in the states and I am sadden that I have never met my nephew. He was born during lockdown and for obvious reasons we cannot see her. I obviously do not want any one to get ill or die for this virus but I would very much like control of our lives back.
