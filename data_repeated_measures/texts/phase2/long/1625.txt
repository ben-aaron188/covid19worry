I feel drained and anxious.  Desperate to be able to travel within the country and spend time with family.  I worry about the effect this is having on my children, their missed opportunities and how a lack of time with family and friends will affect them socially.  I am fed up of not being able to do my job but also anxious about being busy with work when I can work again.  I have enjoyed spending quality time with my family and quiet weekends, I'm not desperate to be busy again but it will be nice to have some plans that are exciting and not spend another weekend at home sort of thing.
