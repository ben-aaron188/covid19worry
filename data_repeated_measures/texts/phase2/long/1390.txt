I'm finding it difficult to.be apart from my friends from university, and my boyfriend. I miss having a social life and becoming able to do what I want when I want. I miss my old life, but part of me feels like that life is never coming back. I'm sad and angry that people, myself included, didn't take the pandemic seriously to begin with, because things are awful now,.and it feels like they won't get better. I'm sad that my degree has been half and half out of lockdown and in lockdown, and I'm worried it will decrease the validity of whatever grade I come out with in summer. If I do well, will people thing they were going easy.becaise of the situation, if I do badly will people think I'm stupid because I couldn't learn from home? I'm angry all the time about the situation and the people still.not taking it seriously. I go to work and have to deal with customers not wearing masks properly, and paying with all.the change they have instead of card, and the only thing that has eased my mind about me coming in contact with all these idiots is the fact that now all my grandparents, and parents are vaccinated so I won't pass anything bad to.them from work.
