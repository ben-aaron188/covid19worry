Honestly just tired. I have gone past the fear stage now. I just really miss people and experiences. I miss having freedom to choose what I want to do. I feel like the situation has drained me though. Living the same day over and over again has really made everything seem like hard work. I find it hard to get motivated, and also hard to see how things are ever going to be the same as they were before. I cannot wait to be vaccinated and just hope that the country and the world start to lift lockdown measures
