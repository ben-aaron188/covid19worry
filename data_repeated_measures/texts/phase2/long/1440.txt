I feel less happy about the lockdown situation than previously, its starting to grind a bit now since the weather has been bad and going out for a walk and cycling is less of an enticing prospect. At first i didn't miss social occasions much but now i feel like i miss it, going for a drink with friends or going to a theme park seems like and exciting prospect.Im starting to look forward to the end and feel positive that that end is in sight. However its been a long time since 'normality' and it is going to take some ajustment to the new normal and what that looks like. Im concerened about vaccine availability and how far down the list i am when everything is starting to open up again and i will be expected to return to the office. While im looking forward to the future im still very much aware that the virus is around and before everyone is vaccinated it is a real threat, not just to the old and vulnerable but everyone.
