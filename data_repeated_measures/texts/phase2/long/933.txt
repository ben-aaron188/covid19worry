I am a little fed up with the Corona situation. It has made work a lot more challenging over the last few months and that has made me frustrated. 
It also has made it harder to unwind since we have not been allowed out to see friends and family. 
I am optimistic about the future though since we now have a path out of this and the vaccination scheme appears to be working very effectively. 
I am looking forward to next month when we will be able to visit family again and stay away from home. This will be an opportunity to escape what has been a very repetitive life for the last for months.
