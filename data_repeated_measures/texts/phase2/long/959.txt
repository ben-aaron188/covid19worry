I feel optimistic and excited about the future and glad that we have hope that the end is in sight. I am bored, but grateful that my family and friends are safe. I feel eager for life to return to normal. My work has become very stressful and would appreciate being able to return to normal work life. I am thankful for the extra time I can spend with loved ones during lockdown though. Over the last year I have not liked the fear of unknown, but having clear deadlines set out by government is really helpful
