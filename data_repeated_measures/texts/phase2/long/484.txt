I feel regretful regarding the impact this had on the the UK and other countries. However, just like we came through other pandemics in history, I feel optimistic and hopeful we will come through this, especially with the vaccine which I feel is safe and effective. I feel relief that coronavirus cases are falling and that the UK is starting to ease lockdown restrictions. I also feel a sense of determination to contribute to the recovery of the economy and on a personal level, becoming more healthy, as this pandemic has reminded me of the value of excellent health.
