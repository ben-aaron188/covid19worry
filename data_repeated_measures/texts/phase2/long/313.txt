I believe we are making a great effort to vaccinate the majority of the nation, the one thing I disagree with is that the schools have gone back so urgently. I believe this may cause another rise in cases for the people that have not yet had the vaccine. This will in turn push back the other relaxations of the lockdown, meaning sports cannot return and pubs/restaurants cannot open.
I want to return back to work in London at the earliest and this will not become available until June 21st at least.
