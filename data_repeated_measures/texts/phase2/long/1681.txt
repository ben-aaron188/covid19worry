I'm starting to feel optimistic about the situation. The jabs are being given to a wider section of the community, including people I know now. I feel it won't be long until we're broadly back to normal. Biggest worry I have is on employment, even where I work things don't feel as stable as they have done for the previous 20 years! I'm looking forward to being able to start dating (marriage broke up a couple of months before COVID) as I've been single and alone all this time. Also looking forward to a holiday and travelling a little.
