Very anxious that schools are reopening on Monday despite local rates still being higher than the rest of the country. I feel it was a mistake to give an end date of 21st June as I feel people will start ignoring the rules, as previously proven when dates are given too far in advance. I will personally feel like I can relax a little bit more when both my parents have had their vaccine, and there’s a more concrete idea of when I might be eligible for my first vaccine. I hope that this is the last lockdown we have to endure as I’ve found it very challenging from a mental point of view this time, largely due to cold weather and shorter days.
