I’m feeling angry at the people who are not following the rules, I want it all to be over and back to normal again, I’m just fed up with not being able to see my friends and family properly and when there are people breaking the rules and doing whatever they like its just a massive slap in the face.
I am feeling happy with the fact vaccines are being given out and how quick its all happening, I hope that this give us more freedom in the next couple of months and hopefully start seeing some ‘normality’ coming back into our lives.
