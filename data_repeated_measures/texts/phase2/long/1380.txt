I am annoyed because the uk government did not respond quickly enough despite having so much information at their disposal regarding the outbreak in other countries and chose to ignore scientific advice. We have all had to suffer and lose out on so much of our lives as a result. 

I'm sad about the deaths that could have been avoided and I'm angry that we have the highest death rate per capita in the world, again because of our government. 

I dont know how long 500 characters is so i'll just add this down here
