I feel some optimism given the speed of the vaccine rollout in my country. However, as there are variants of the virus there I am slightly anxious that if the rest of the world is not vaccinated to a significant degree then this all might go on for much longer. There is a plan for reducing restrictions in my country so there is something to look forward to with regards to visiting family and friends once again, so I remain hopeful and optimistic that there is an end in sight. I also feel some anger towards our government who have used the crisis to line the pockets of their friends whilst presiding over one of the worst death rates in the world, and one of the hardest-hit economies.
