I feel sadness for all who have lost love ones and i fear there will be more lives lost unless people start taking this seriously, i fear people having the first injections are going to relax there covid measures and it will start to spread even more.
until all the injections have been rolled out it will be impissible to control it and even then it will be a huge task to keep it under control.
People will start to behave normal and not be on there gaurd especially taking trips abroad etc
Schools are starting to re-open which may cause even more harm,I understand we all need to get back to normal and the economy needs to open up but i fear until all covid jabs have been made it maybe to quick to start to do anything,
