A slight sense of unreality, like the world is a little strange right now. People behave in very irrational ways, there's lots of anxiety and distrust going around. People are fed up being stuck at home with nowhere to go. I miss outdoors so much. I am not a very sociable person even without a pandemic, so I feel comfortable not going shop or visiting friends, but bot being able to travel as I please is a bummer! We need outdoors for our mental health. Also, I feel there is a lot of disinformation and fake news floating around, and some of my friends and acquaintances have really embraced it. I am often left feeling that either I am the last rational person I know or that I'm completely wrong and everyone else knows something that I don't. Luckily, I am not that easily swayed by opinions. Wish this were over soon and I could go back to travelling and exploring, as well as visiting my family. Oh, and I have never had to work a much as I am working right now. This past year my workload has doubled, and my average hours have increased from 48 to 58.
