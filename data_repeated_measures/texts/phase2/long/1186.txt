I feel as though nothing is really ever going to be how it was again and I’ve forgotten what life used to be like even after just a year or so. I can just see this going on and on despite vaccines and rates/deaths dropping I just feel that we’re stuck in a cycle now that will go on and on with no clear way out. Just as we get some sort of hope it’s always then quickly taken away and replaced with more restrictions that seem to be more harsh than the one before, despite the majorities best efforts and intentions there is always more and more negativity and doom and gloom to be reported and greater controls put on our lives, so much damage has now been done by this, physically and mentally to be people and families I can’t see how they are going to be able to recover from this quickly
