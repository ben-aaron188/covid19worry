Pretty relaxed as seeing a few select people is a small risk, no more dangerous than going to the supermarket.
I don’t think there’s a high risk I’ll catch it or pass it on.
I am worried about catching it and how it would affect me but think the risk is small and after not seeing anyone for a year took its toll and has lasted too long.
I am excited about being able to socialise properly and enjoy the company of our usual group of friends who used to meet every week for drinks or dinner.
I am hoping the vaccine is a success and means the risk to people is much less so life can go back to some sort of normal and the NHS can cope.
