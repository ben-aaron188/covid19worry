I am not as worried as I was before as I know that the death rate is slowly dropping as more vaccinations are being offered. Also, I am not experiencing many deaths in my line of work (working at the hosptial) as I was beforehand which is a great thing! I am still quite a bit saddened knowing that families were not able to be with their loved ones who passed away due to the pandemic. It can be very tiring having to follow pandemic rules and not seeing an end in sight, but it absolutely is for the best.
