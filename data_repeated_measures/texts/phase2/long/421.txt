I am so frustrated and annoyed with the coronavirus restrictions now, I feel trapped and I hate it. I can’t live like this for much longer. It’s affecting my mental and physical health. My neighbours are being really intimidating and I am scared being trapped here with no escape is just unbearable.  As soon as the restrictions have eased I will be going to see my family. Going to the beach and having fun, instead of stepping on eggshells and feeling unsafe in my own home. Boris Johnson has absolutely no idea on how the poorer or working class live, and before I was in this situation myself I had no idea how hard life is when you have less money and support to get the security and safety that a person needs in life. I feel like I don’t have the basic human rights that I should be entitled too, just because I have less money than other people. My husband works full time and I am a stay at home parent, and we are struggling financially because of the current climate.
