I am happy because I have had my first vaccination, and that the vaccination rollout is going well, but I am still concerned about many things - the economy of the UK and the world as a whole - children's education - people's mental health. I feel in a constant state of limbo, always waiting for the next announcement or development. I feel unable to make any long term plans or decisions. I think that the government is doing as well as they can, there are no right answers in this situation, only a choice of least wrong ones.
