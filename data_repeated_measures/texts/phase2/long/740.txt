I feel less pressure during lockdown and generally more relaxed. However I am missing being able to go out, going on holidays and have not seen some members of my family for over a year now.  My elderly relatives have now had the first vaccination so I feel reassured of their safety and wellbeing and am looking forward to visiting them in the summer. This must be 500 characters but I keep getting the message, not 500 characters. This is not reasonable, especially as there is no character count!!!!
