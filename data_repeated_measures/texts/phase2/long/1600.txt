I am so sad for the lost opportunities of my children who are both at such important ages and stages in their life. They will never get this time back and have missed so much. 
I am also filled with anger and disgust at the corruption,  greed and immorality of our government. There is no forgiving their profiteering from this pandemic and their contempt they have shown normal families especially disabled people. They think disabled people are valueless, disposable. They think nurses are cannon fodder. They get rich off the misery and pain of the people they are elected to govern, protect and serve. I am filled with despair for the lack of decency and goodness shown by the people who have such power in this country
