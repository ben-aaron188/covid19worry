I would say I am cautiosly optimistic currently, as I feel that progress is slowly being made and we are through the worst the pandemic.  There is stil a way to go yet, but I am hopeful that within about 6 months the world will be mostly back to some sort of normal.  I'm still appauled at the way the government handled it from the start - a great many lives have been lost that could've been easily avoided with proper management of the situation.  I appreciate that it is an unprecedented event recent history, but it is very much an expected event in long-history: humankind encounters pandemics like this every 100-200 years, so we knew it was coming - we had been warned years ago by people like Bill Gates and virologists and generally more globally aware people etc ...at least now we would be better prepared for the next one.
