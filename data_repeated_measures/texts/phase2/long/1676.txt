I am concerned for myself, family, and the world in general. Although there are early signs that Covid may be coming under control, no one can accurately forecast whether this is the case. This may be a short-term respite and the world may have to consider further more drastic measures. It is very frustrating that there is no definitive solution to enable forward planning.
It is at times difficult to remain motivated due to myself and my colleagues all working from home. There is a lack of cohesiveness in the virtual workplace with a reduction in morale.
