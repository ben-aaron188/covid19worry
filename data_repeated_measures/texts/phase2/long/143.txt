I feel very anxious that my children have gone back to school when a lot of people have still not been vaccinated. I feel that our government lies purely for their own financial gain and don't care as much about peoples health and welfare. I am a little worried about side effects or effectiveness of the vaccines but at the same time remain hopeful they will help us in tackling covid and provide us with some more protection. I will still continue to be very careful with hygiene and what I do as lockdown eases. I definitely don't feel like I want to rush out to restaurants, shops and go on holidays any time soon.
