I feel hopeful about the UK'S COVID-19 situation because with the NHS vaccination rollout going successfully and a somewhat sensible road map outlined by the UK government, I very much hope that everything will return to some form of normality fairly soon. I am a little anxious that people will become complacent the more the restrictions ease and cases will spike again, especially with kids in schools all mixing together and pubs reopening in April. I haven't seen my mum properly since last August/September and I would love to see her again properly rather than standing outside her front door distanced after doing some shopping for her as she has to shield.
