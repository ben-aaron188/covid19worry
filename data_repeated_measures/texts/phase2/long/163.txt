I'm angery that our government didn't care enough to deal with the situation properly. This pandemic is scary and one hundrad thousand plus people died when it was proventable. Boris cared more about brexit and didn't even address the pandemic until brexit was over. He is selfish and should be put in prision. He doesn't learn and still isn't. People matter. I'm mad, lonely, frustrated, and just want to live. How dare he decide who should live and die! I'm talking about the dnr with people with learning disabilities. He killed them to save money!!
