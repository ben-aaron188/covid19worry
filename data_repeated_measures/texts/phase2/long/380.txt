I am ready for the lockdown to be over. I am longing and looking forward to going out again. Having to stay home out of compulsion is a bit stressful and I think it is beginning to have adverse effects on our bodies and our minds. A lot of my friends are now seeking yoga classes especially because of back pain from sitting down for long hours in front of a computer doing meetings and using the internet. I also think creativity is being killed by having to stay at home with little or no interaction with other people from work or even friends.
