I feel concerned that the Coronavirus will continue to rob many lives and affect our lives for the future. It makes me feel anxious as I wonder what the world will look like when it is safe to return to some normality again. It makes me nervous thinking about what ‘’normal’ might be and whether we will have a new normal that we have to just adapt to. Coronavirus has affected every person in some way and it has changed the world. It makes me feel anxious thinking about the amount of people who have lost their jobs, their homes and their families.
