I feel worried as I am returning to work as a primary teacher on Monday. I still have had no vaccine and I’ll be around 30+ children from different families. This is making me very anxious. I feel locked in with nowhere to go. It feels like I have nothing to look forward to and that this situation will never end.
I miss my friends and seeing all of my family. I haven’t seen my Nan/aunties/uncles/cousins in over a year. 
I am currently indoors and feel safe as can be at this present moment but the outside world is what makes me anxious.
