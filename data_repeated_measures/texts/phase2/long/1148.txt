It has been a long time - so tiredness and sadness are the main feelings. Of course I’m worried, also as some of my family members got sick, including the long covid, but I’m mostly just sad and tired. I’m also a little hopeful- for the future because of vaccines and just in general because we will not be able to carry on like this for ever. 
I’m rather fortunate, relatively to many people, but this doesn’t stop me from feeling sad and tired, just makes me also feel guilty - which is also not helpful. 
The winter - January - was a particularly sad time.
