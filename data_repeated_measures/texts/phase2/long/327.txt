I’m tired of the Corona situation and I just want everything to go back to normal however I think adjusting to the new normal will be difficult as we have been in lockdown restrictions for way too long. I’m sad about all the lives that have been lost and fearful of losing loved ones. Some good things have come out of the situation such as being able to work from home rather than having my job lost or being on furlough, this has meant I no longer have to commute to work so have saved money on transport costs.
