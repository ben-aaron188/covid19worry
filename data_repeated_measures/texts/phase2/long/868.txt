I am at my limits of lockdown - the winter months have taken their toll on my mental health and wellbeing - particularly as I live alone. I feel isolated, lonely and frustrated. I want to see people and resume normality. I really hope that with Spring approaching and the vaccination programme progressing at pace that we can see the end of being locked away from friends and family and we can enjoy better weather and freedom from this seemingly never ending nightmare. I hope that nothing gets in the way to put any blocks in the way
