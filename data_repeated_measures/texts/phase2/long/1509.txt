Missing family and friends. The thought of rules and dates getting pushed back worries me. Government not handled it well, masks should of been bought in earlier. Lock down should of been bought in before the 1sr one they waited to long. But the vaccine programme is the best bit about it. I have had my vaccine and it was a very easy process and put my mind at ease. I have a two year old that needs to be out socialing and seeing people his own age. He needs to see his family that he hasn't seen for months.
