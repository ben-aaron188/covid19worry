I feel annoyed, disappointed, and anxious. I am tired of the current situation. The UK government did terribly, and have made the whole situation last much longer and more serious than it is supposed to. The world as a whole is not getting better any time soon, which is just depressing. I feel like there is little hope to improve my life quality. I can't get any support scheme. There is no job security or finance security. All in all,it's a dark time of my life, a dark time for many peple like me.
