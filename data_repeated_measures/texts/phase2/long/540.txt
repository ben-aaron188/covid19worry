I feel like I’m just waiting for my vaccine and to get back to normal, it’s a case of counting down the days until my age group is illegible to receive it. I am feeling optimistic but cautious, as the government has messed things up countless times before and there is a sense of wondering if they’ll get it wrong again. It seems like we’ve finally turned a corner on the pandemic and that relative normality is in sight, it’s just a case of getting the next few months right. Whilst things may never be the same again, I feel the most relaxed about the situation that I have since last year. I think the summer coming up helps this sense.
