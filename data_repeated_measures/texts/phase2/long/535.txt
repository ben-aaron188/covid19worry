The COVID situation in this country has been mis-managed by the government, creating an economic crisis, unnecessary deaths, and more inequality. Yet many votes forget the 120,000 needless deaths from an incompetent government and still support them due to the vaccine rollout - which is not a guarantee to avoid COVID!! Life has been calmer as towns and places of work are quieter, making them easier to navigate and more pleasant to be in, but this of course does not outweigh the downsides. My ability to adapt and cope with this pandemic is not as important as the fear that many feel, the mental health crisis caused, and the economic ruin.
