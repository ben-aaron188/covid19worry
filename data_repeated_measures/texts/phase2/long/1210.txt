I feel very sad that my children's lives have been so affected, and their futures. I feel afraid of covid, but am very thankful that we have kept safe and that there are vaccines for us in the future. I work hard on keeping relaxed and calm, as I believe this helps me keep well. I do feel worried for the country and our own finances, but also grateful that we live in a country where we are looked after. Covid scares me but I also try not to let it take over, we are fortunate to live in a rural area where it is easier to keep some solitude. I have not missed being with people at all.
