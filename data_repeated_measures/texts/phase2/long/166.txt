At the moment I feel like the Corona Virus pandemic is coming to an end and I'm hoping that everything will be back to normal very soon. In the next couple of weeks I think that the lockdown's will be lifted and everything can re-open. I would like to see the schools, pubs, gyms, leisure centres opened and I would like to see the mask mandate scrapped. I'm concerned about the government talking about Covid passports and I'm worried by the amount of old people that have been dying after receiving the Covid vaccine.
