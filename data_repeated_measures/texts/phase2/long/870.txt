I donâ€™t feel that worried about the coronavirus situation at the moment especially because of the vaccine. A lot of my family have had the vaccine as they are older age or doctors and I am getting my vaccine tomorrow as I have severe asthma. I am mainly sad now about the lockdown and am of the frame of mind that the effect of lockdown can be worse than that of the virus, though I do realise the severity of the virus and realise that lockdown must be put in place. I have been surprisingly quite relaxed about the virus on the whole though I am not sure why as I am usually quite susceptible to illnesses and thought that if I do have COVID I would get it badly.
