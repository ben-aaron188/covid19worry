I feel sadness at all the things my children have missed out on over the last year. But things are feeling more positive now with the success of the vaccine out roll out. I feel more optimistic that I may be able to return to work after this lockdown, in a few weeks time. I have found it really difficult not being able to operate my business due to the lockdown and the has created financial worries for me. This is an ongoing issue until I can start my business again. The sun is shining today and Spring is on its way which gives me a lift.
