Done. Restrictions have been in place for far too long. There is nothing to look forward to, everything is so bleak. My toddler has had no social interactions with other children his age as he was born 6 months before first lockdown. My husband hasn’t been able to work for nearly a year due to his sector. We have little money and everything is stressful. Everyone I speak to seems depressed and agree that the days are hard. I’m not depressed, there’s just nothing positive at the moment - I am sick of going to the park for a walk. Plus there seems to be many in London and other cities who are no longer obliging - why am I bothering? The government has given away millions and will not be held accountable. I read somewhere that for the amount they spent on the failed track and trace they could have actually given every UK adult £500k. Kick in the teeth. I hate them.
