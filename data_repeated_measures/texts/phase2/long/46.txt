With vaccination against the virus now possible I feel there may be an end in sight to the long period of lockdown. I think that the virus will not go away fully however, and would not be surprised if new variants continue to emerge and Corona flare ups become similar to flu in the winter, especially if there are incidents where strains not affected by the vaccine develop.

I also wonder if the governments responsible for large numbers of deaths (e.g. the US & UK) will be called to account for their poor handling of this crisis when compared to others who were much more successful in their dealing with it (e.g. New Zealand).
