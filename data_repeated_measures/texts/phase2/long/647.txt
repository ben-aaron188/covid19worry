I am mindful of the risks of COVID and have done all I can to minimise exposure for myself and family.  As we have people who are high risk in the household we have been shielding. Lockdown can be difficult mentally, but I understand the need for it and I wish others were mindful too as I feel we, as a nation could have had fewer casualties if people, inc the govt had acted with a modicum of common sense. 

I am now waiting to hear when the vaccine will be available. I have no issues with it and will take it in the hope that we are taking steps  to getting back to a new normal.
