I feel stressed due to the financial situation my family are in, my work are threatening my job due to the vaccine and forcing it onto the staff. The worry and anger this is causing is affecting my health and wellbeing mentally and physically is a struggle, once the country opens up I hope it approves for us all, a night out would be a relief, hopefully getting an idea of where to get funding to start a new business will come through otherwise I can see myself getting up and walking away from this current situation
