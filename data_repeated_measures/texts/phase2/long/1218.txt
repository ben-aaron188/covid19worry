I feel conflicted about the corona predicament. I feel as a nation and globally whether this pandemic had been addressed adequately or whether we have to live with this as a new norm. 

The U.K. government and counties have implemented social changes to reduce the spread of the virus. This includes social distancing, closures of hospitality, schools and offices, with the views to reduce to the spread of the virus. I feel that some of these changes have brought “fruits to bear” that is to say the numbers of deaths, those effected directly and indirectly have seen a vast reduction of the virus spread. However, I feel that the government, have not acted quickly when needed. 

There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the situation. Even though there has been efforts made to control it, it is still unclear on what the foreseeable future is.
