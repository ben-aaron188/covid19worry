I feel optimistic we are moving in the right direction but I am frustrated that people are not sticking to lockdown rules. 
I also hope coming out of lockdown my work maintain some remote working measures as I would prefer not to waste 2 hours a day commuting. 
The vaccination programme has given a lot of people a far more positive outlook on the situation in the Uk but there needs to be a final push to stay at home and make sure there isnâ€™t an increase in cases so thing cans reopen as soon as possible.
