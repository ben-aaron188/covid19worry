I'm hopeful for the future, especially now that vaccination has started across the world. I am looking forward to seeing my friends and family again. I want to make the most of the summer. I get slightly frustrated towards those who break the rules as I feel they are putting us back in our progress to beat the virus. However, I do understand that people's wills are failing and most of us are doing our best to behave in a way that protects public health while improving our own mental health. I am often tempted to break the rules. I am grateful and feel lucky that I have university studies to focus on and a placement to go to, as I imagine being stuck in the house all day would be very depressing and unstimulating.
