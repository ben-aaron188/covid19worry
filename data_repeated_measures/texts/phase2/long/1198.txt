I feel ok about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic situation because the incident numbers are starting to decline in the U.K., we are rolling out the vaccine quite rapidly and our children are able to go back to school. For the first time in a long time, it feels like we have some semblance of control over the situation and like we may be able to start doing some things we haven’t been able to do for a long time. I am looking forward to being able to do things that I haven’t been able to do like make plans and have things to look forward to again in the future.
