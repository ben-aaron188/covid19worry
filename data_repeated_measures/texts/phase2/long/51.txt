i feel completely deflated, the government keeping making so many promises they can’t keep, prioritising the wrong things and whilst everyone i see is hopeful for things to be more normal by june 21st, our track record has shown me not to trust a single thing, it just feels like there’s still too far to go before i will feel any better about the situation, i am severely depressed, i’ve been unable to work for a year and it’s no clearer when i can go back, i’m not receiving furlough because of the governments incompetence so i’m a sitting duck waiting for my job to be able to go ahead
