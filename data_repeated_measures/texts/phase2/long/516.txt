I feel quite relieved that the R number has decreased and that people are becoming more hopeful about the future.  That being said, I still feel a bit cautious regarding the future with the new variants and how the vaccines will deal with these.  We know how much effort and time it takes to produce a vaccine and vaccinate most of the population, therefore, if these vaccines have to be tweaked this takes time and then the population would most likely have to have a booster which takes a lot of time and effort.  My worry is that we could be in and out of lockdown for quite a long time if this was the case.
