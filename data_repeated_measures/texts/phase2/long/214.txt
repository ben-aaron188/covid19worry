I'm not worried if I catch it as I'm 33 and not at an age that'll affect me. To be honest I'm lucky as I have my friendships etc already established and I'm still working full time but just from home. With my work situation as well I've had so much overtime so I'm making a lot of money just now.  Which I know is terrible to say but its helped us to do up our house and pay off credit cards. It's more just my friends I'm missing just now. I'm really close to my friends and not getting to see them is the hardest. Especially as 2 of my friends have just had babies
