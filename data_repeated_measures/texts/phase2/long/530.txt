For me the whole pandemic hasn't really had much of an effect on me at all. I suffer from schizophrenia and even pre-pandemic my affect was totally blunt, I was in a state of intense dissociation. This started in 2019 and carried on through the entirety of 2020. Because I was in a state of dissociation - I was not going out at all, I would never leave my bed because I possessed no emotions and will/desire to move was simply not there. 

Right now in 2021 it's quite different as I'm out of that state. I am moderately anxious about the future because I don't know how I'm going to fit back into society, it's too much to take in.
