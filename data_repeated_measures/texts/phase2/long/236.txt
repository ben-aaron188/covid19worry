very worried about how it will effect me or my family as the virus is so unpredictable. I have more bad days than good days filled with anxiety and fear. I watch the news daily and Google covid before bed every night. I cannot wait for this to be over and have some normality back. I feel upset and angry that my old life has been taken away from me. I feel sorry for my children who have been separated from their friends and family for so long. I cannot wait to have a social life and not live in fear. it has been a long 12 months.
