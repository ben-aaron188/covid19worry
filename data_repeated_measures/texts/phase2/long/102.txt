It feels as thought things are begginging to look more optimistic. Although full eradication of covid is not possible, even though some political parties believed this to be true. It is good that schools can reopen as I feel sorry for children who are missing out on lessons and seeing their friends. Personally, from a working from home perspective, I know feel so comfortable with situation that I am anxious about returning to office environment. It just seems uneccesarily risky to open up all sectors of economy in one full go. I would much rather see a return to the office still some way off.
