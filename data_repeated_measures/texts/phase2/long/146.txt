I have a few different feeling about the current covid situation. Firstly, I feel apathetic as it's gone on for so long and I've been working throughout, so have only been going to work then home over and over. Although, I feel lucky to still have a job considering tons of businesses have closed. I am also hopeful for coming out of lockdown and being able to see friends, family and socialise again. At the same time I am worried the lockdown won't end and we will have to go through it all again, with no end in sight.
