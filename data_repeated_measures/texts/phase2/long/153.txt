I'm hopeful that vaccines will help us to learn to live with the situation. I feel angry with anti vaxxers and people who don't abide by the guidelines. I worry about what the world will be like for my children. I'm scared about catching the virus and maybe being badly affected so I'm not going out very much. I'm really missing seeing my family and friends and I can't imagine ever wanting to go on a plane again at present. I wish the government had been stricter with lockdown earlier on because now in think in people don't believe what they say
