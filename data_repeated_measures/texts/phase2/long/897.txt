I feel happy that the the peak of the latest outbreak appears to be past, and am hopeful that that the vaccination program is going well should eventually result in an end to widespread outbreaks. I am angry and frustrated at how poorly the pandemic has been managed by the government however. They were slow to respond to the changing situation throughout. Lockdowns were enacted too late, and lifted too early, which has resulted in a much higher number of deaths than might otherwise have happened.
