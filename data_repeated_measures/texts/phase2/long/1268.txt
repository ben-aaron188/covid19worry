I am a little happier with the current COVID situation compared to a few months ago as rates of infection and deaths are falling. Now that we also have a vaccine and it is being delivered with such great speed it means that some of my loved ones are now protected and in the next few months I will also receive my first vaccine thus giving me a greater peace of mind to their well-being. There is however, still an overall sadness at some of the losses we have all had to deal with both emotionally and financially and I am still very anxious about what the new normal will be and the long term effects this last year may have had on my childrenâ€™s education and future job/life opportunities.
