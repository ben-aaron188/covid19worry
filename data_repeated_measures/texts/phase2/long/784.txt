Regarding the coronavirus situation, I feel some form of hope that there may be a light at the end of the tunnel where we can have some sort of normality back in our lives. I don't believe that the roadmap we have been given by the government will be exact and I feel some stages are premature but I cannot wait to be able to see my friends again and go on holidays.  I also feel a sense of sadness when thinking about all of the experiences I have missed out on in the last year and will continue to miss out on for a while yet. However, most importantly I feel so grateful that my family are safe and well and that I've been able to spend so much more time with them this year than I have ever got to before.
