I feel angry at the government regarding the PPE deals and the NHS payrise. I am 36 weeks pregnant and anxious about contracting the virus and my husband not being allowed to stay with me whilst I'm in hospital.

I am relieved that my grandparents and parents have had the vaccine and can't wait to be able to spend time together again. I am no longer working as I'm a nurse so it has been a very lonely time. I have been suffering with depression and anxiety as a result of the lockdown.

I am also worried about EU countries suspending the vaccine and hope that this isn't going to happen in the UK. 

I also feel some disbelief that all restrictions will be lifted in June.
