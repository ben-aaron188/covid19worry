I am very anxious and upset about the current situation. I am fed up and unhappy with current restrictions even though I know they are necessary. I am tired of things never improving and only getting worse. I feel trapped in this situation. Today has been particularly difficult and I have felt really sad. Even virtual connections are not helping. I feel lonely and isolated from life. I am bored, even activities and hobbies I used to do don't entertain me anymore due to my feelings about to Coronavirus situation.
