I am optimistic that with the roll out of the vaccine and curbs being lifted gradually we will be back to normal soon. I also hope that I will be called for taking the vaccination soon. 

I look forward to going out to various places such as leisure centres and museums and theatres and meeting people again. I have missed these activities for the last year. I am also looking forward to travelling to various destinations both within and outside the country for pleasure. 

My only worry is that if cases start rising again then the government might impose further lockdowns, which I would not be in support.
