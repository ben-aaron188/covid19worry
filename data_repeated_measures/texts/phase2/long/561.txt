I am feeling very helpless at the moment because I am missing my family and friends. If coronavirus wasn't around I would be looking forward to the spring and being outside with family and friends.

I am scared as to how I will pay my bills in the next few days and I am very hungry as I've no money for food shopping. I am feeling very stressed and I would like covid to stop affecting my life now. 

I am currently self employed and my lack of work over the last few months has left me feeling delated and anxious.
