I feel sadness about what has happened in the past year, both in terms of the people who have died or been bereaved, and the impact on all of our day to day lives, for instance young people at school and people who live in care homes, and the effect on social relationships. I feel hopeful that with the rollout of the vaccination programme things will be able to return closer to normal but I am anxious about how long this will take. I do not personally feel particularly anxious about catching Covid 19 as I do not feel I am at high risk of serious illness.
