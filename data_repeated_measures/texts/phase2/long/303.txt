There are so many people around at the moment. The road outside is full of cars, and that worries me. I'm a little more relaxed than I was this time last year. I've had my first coronavirus injection, so that has gone some way to easing my fear. But I do worry about whether or not they will ever give us the second injection. I'm not sure I trust a government whose main aim seems to be telling the world that they've vaccinated more of the population than anyone else while knowing that they've not actually fully vaccinated them at all.
