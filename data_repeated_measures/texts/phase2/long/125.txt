At the moment I am weary of the situation. I have tried to keep very carefully to the rules. I am high-risk, and a year of the media acting as though my life is less important has been very difficult. I am missing my family, my friends, swimming, eating out, seeing my colleagues and mooching around charity shops on rainy afternoons. I am also incredibly frustrated by the people I see breaking the rules and acting as though Covid-19 is a joke. I want this to be over, and they get in the way of that.
