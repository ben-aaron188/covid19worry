I feel confident of how the pandemic is turning. With a roadmap out and prospects that we can socialise again normally in the summer has cheered me up.
I currently feel frustrated though as live with vulnerable parent and means even when restrictions start to lift caution will still be needed. But i do feel safer as both me and my dad have had the vaccine so gives you a bit of boost.
I am pretty annoyed with peoples lack of compliance with rules at moment though, with people acting like its all over. This does make me worry that they will mess it up for everyone.
