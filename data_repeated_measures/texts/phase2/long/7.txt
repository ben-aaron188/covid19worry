Okay, bored and fed up of not being able to do as much as usual, like go shopping and out for meals, go out for the day with my family. Unhappy that we can see more of my friends and family,  am missing having less people to talk to.  Happy that me and my family are all well and feeling healthy. Also I am fed up with homeschooling my child, as I have to work at the same time and this can be quite stressful. But looking forward to getting back to normal life later in the year.  I managing each day as it comes and keep busy at home.
