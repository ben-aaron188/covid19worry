I feel that the situation does not make complete sense. I feel uncertainty and fearfulness for the future. I am sad at the thought of whether life will ever be the same again and I miss spending time with family and friends. 
I hope that things will return to normal and we will be able to forget the past year. I am also shocked that the situation has lasted as long as it has. It is hard to believe that we were previously able to do as we liked without rules in terms of socializing, eating out and earning a living.
