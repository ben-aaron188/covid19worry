I feel in this country the situation has been gravely mishandled. There is some light at the end of the tunnel with the success of the vaccination program, however, we are all exhausted. Those who have kept the country running are being under appreciated and I feel nothing will change. Those at the top will line their pockets while everyone else suffers. I feel less worried about the health repercussions, however, the economic, public health and societal issues to come are worrying. I still worried that at some point the NHS and our hospitals may be overwhelmed as people become complacent or stop caring. It’s a very difficult situation. I’d love to go on holiday and have a break but I feel this will not happen for a few years. I’m so fortunate to have continued working and not been impacted financially, but it has been stressful and tiring.
