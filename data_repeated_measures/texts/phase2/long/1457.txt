Working in a school i feel frustrated that school staff have not been prioritised for the vaccine, i do feel anxious about the covid situation although I do feel hope that the situation will improve in the next few months. I feel sad for my children and the sacrifices we have made and life events we have missed out from celebrating in a normal way such as birthday parties. I miss my family and friends and having the freedom to do everyday things like go out for dinner or drinks and going out shopping. I do think the future is looking more positive.
