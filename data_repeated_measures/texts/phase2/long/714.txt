Hopeful that we are emerging from the terrible year we've had. 

Angry that the government has mismanaged this so badly we are still in lockdown a year after the pandemic started. So many lives have been lost unnecessarily that it is hard to comprehend the loss so many people have felt.

Desperate to get this over and done with so we can return to normal  life. The people just need to stick with the guidelines for another few months and we have every chance of beating this.

Proud of the NHS rollout of the vaccination programme that is helping us move towards a return to our lives.
