I am furious with how our government has handled the situation, prioritising giving business to their friend over saving people's lives. I feel betrayed and angry. But most of all I feel completely hopeless, every time they say the end is in sight people get their hopes up only to be screwed over by yet another foolish decision from the government. I am bitter and drained and so angry I could scream, the government have betrayed us at every step and praise themselves while ignoring the rules and profiting. They have sacrificed teachers, NHS and all essential workers and preached their bravery while giving them no choice, no support and no reward.
