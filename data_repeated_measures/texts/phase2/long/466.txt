I just want it to be over and to return to normal life as soon as possible although I understand this may take some time. I feel tired of the current situation but I feel there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine etc. I just hope we don't go into another lockdown once this one has eventually been lifted.
I'm glad that at least I can see my parents as we are in a childcare bubble and that they have had the vaccine. I think there has been quite a bit of stress caused not just by the pandemic but the Government handling of it through each stage we seem to have been behind the curve.
