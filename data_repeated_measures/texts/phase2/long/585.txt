The main issue I have at the moment is the disgraceful conduct of the government when it comes to highly lucrative contracts for their donors and other cronies.  The track and trace system that has cost billions and which has been a total disaster is a total scandal and has cost many lives as well as a huge amount of money, angers me.  The fact that the government dithered and kept changing its mind, the lack of action on the Barnard Castle affair - leading to the breakdown of lockdown - and the loss of yet more lives, anger me. The huge death toll saddens and angers me. The 1% pay rise for nurses infuriates me and is truly representative of the lack of any kind of understanding of the mood of the people.
