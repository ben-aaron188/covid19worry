I feel like we are on the way out of the pandemic because of the vaccine rollout. This makes me feel a lot less anxious than before. I don't feel as in danger as I did a few months ago when the cases were high. I am hopeful for the future but will continue to follow the rules until told otherwise. I hope to get a vaccine soon so we can all get on with the rest of our lives. I feel good right now because there is light at the end of the tunnel. Once this is all over, we will probably have a gathering, maybe go for somewhere to eat as a family with lots of our relatives. I am quite happy at the moment and enjoying staying at home.
