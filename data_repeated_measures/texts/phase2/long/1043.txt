I am hopeful that this is the last lockdown. It has been a really testing time for the family in lodown. I felt like it has got a bit monotonous and tedious now. I am feeling fed up and lockdown is a lot harder than it was at the start of the pandemic. I am feeling optimistic that the vaccine is the way out. It fills me with excitement that we can start making plans again: I am getting excited about planning my 30th birthday party celebrations. I am also getting excited for my best friends wedding again after it was clouded with doubt until the recent announcements of the roadmap out of lockdown
