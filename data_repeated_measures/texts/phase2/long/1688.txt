I'm concerned that because Boris had revealed his road map, people will stop following the rules properly. I have seen people doing this already. I am also really missing my family who I haven't really seen for almost a year. I don't have any fears or worries about work as this is very stable for me. In working from home and there's zero risk that I could lose my job. I'm also a little worried about how I will handle coming out of lockdown.  I'm quite socially anxious do the thought of doing people again and going back to office based working has me worried
