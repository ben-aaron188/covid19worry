I’m annoyed with the government for handling the situation so badly, at the cost of so many lives. On a personal level I’ve been extremely lucky in that no one close to me has been ill so far, but I still worry every day that that could change. I found out I was pregnant with my first child around this time last year and have since gone through an extremely isolated pregnancy and childbirth, and my son has been unable to meet his grandparents. All of this also brings feelings of anger, but mostly sadness, and I hope things improve soon.
