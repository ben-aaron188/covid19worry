I feel optimistic that now that people are being vaccinated we are on the road to getting better. More and more people are being vaccinated every day now. Soon it will be our turn and that makes me happy. Lockdown is about to be eased and we are in a better position than last year. I feel happy knowing we can try to get back to normal soon. I am looking forward to days out on the beach and exploring with my daughter. It’s been a long time since we’ve been anywhere to do something fun or even see somewhere different.
