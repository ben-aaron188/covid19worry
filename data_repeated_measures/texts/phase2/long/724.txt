I'm pleased that no-one close to me has been badly affected by Covid. I'm now anxious that the promised vaccinations are forthcoming, both for myself and for my family. I am sure that issues with the economy will sort themselves out, even if this takes time. I am concerned about reports of a third wave being seen in Eastern / Central Europe, and wonder / hope that the vaccines will prove to be adequate if / when a third wave comes to the UK.
I am curious if we will ever find out who was awarded a contract by the government during the crisis, and if all public money spent will be accounted for.
