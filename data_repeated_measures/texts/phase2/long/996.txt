I feel frustrated with the length of time we have all waited for the restrictions to lift.
I also feel frustrated with the whole situation, between the government messages, the media messages and peoples feelings in general, it has made me sad and frustrated in equal measures.
I would have expected a more optimistic response following the vaccinations, but again frustrated by the messages being sent out.  We have constantly had positive messages about the uptake of the vaccinations, but a rather negative reaction to wanting to open things up again.
