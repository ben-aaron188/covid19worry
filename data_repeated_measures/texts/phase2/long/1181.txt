I feel fed up and a bit hopeless with new virus strains - fearful of the vaccines not helping in the long run and just want it to be over. Desire to go out with my friends as I want to get my life back. It is easy to feel unmotivated to work when there is nothing to look forward to. I do appreciate what I used to have more though - which is a good thing. It is just very isolating and anxiety provoking. i want it to be over to get my life back on track as it can feel upsetting that there is no positive news in the world - this eventually gets on top of you and feels very overwhelming,
