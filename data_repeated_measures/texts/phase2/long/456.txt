I feel optimistic about the Coronavirus situation at the moment. It feels like progress is being made each day and the end is getting closer. I feel like I have got used to the current situation and it has become my new normal. Compared to the start of the pandemic, I feel less worry about myself and the people I care about. I feel less anxious than I did before. I am excited for the future and how it will be different when the world opens up again. Now that the vaccine is being given out, I feel like the most vulnerable people in society are going to have some protection and hopefully this will see the pandemic slow down and the virus become less dangerous and less of a threat to people.
