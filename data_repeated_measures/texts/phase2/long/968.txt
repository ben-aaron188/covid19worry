I am still very worried about the coronavirus but am pleased that the infection rate is going down and so is the admittance to hospital. I have already received my first vaccine jab and am glad lots of other people have also taken the oppportunity to get this. I will be glad when things can start to return to normal and we can spend time with our friends and family again and I can return to work as normal. I have been working from home for a year now. I started a new job in May so have yet to meet my colleagues in person.
