I am very hopeful and optimistic about the Covid-19 situation at the moment. With the vaccine rollout in the UK going very well, there is light at the end of the tunnel at last!I am hopeful thinks with return to some semblance of normality soon albeit with a lot of economic pain still to come. I am very hopeful that my financial situation will improve in the near future as this pandemic has affected my work very badly and I have suffered quite a lot over the last year. My anxiety levels have reduced with Covid cases going down at the moment and I believe a lot of my work will come back in the next few months as restrictions are eased gradually.
