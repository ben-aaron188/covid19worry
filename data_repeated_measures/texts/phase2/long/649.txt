I’m certainly relieved that the vaccinations are going ahead and that older and vulnerable family members have had them. Looking forward to my husband and I getting ours. My children have been into school to do lateral flow tests today but haven’t had results yet (supposed to be in 30 mins) so a bit concerned about that as it’s all up in the air enough as it is.  There is concern about the mutations but am trying not to think about that too much. I would definitely be keen to see able again though
