I currently feel quite disappointed, particularly towards how the government have handled the situation. It's so frustrating seeing other countries handle this better, but also annoying to see people continue to break lockdown restrictions, as we're all longing to go out and see our friends! Its overall a difficult time, but I'm hopeful we can return to normal soon. Although it seems a long way away, with the lockdown roadmap in sight, hopefully the government has finally got it right, especially due to the success of the vaccine in the UK.
