im feeling quite burnt out by it all but at the same time quite used to it. im missing the old days when you didnt have to worry about everything you have to worry about now. the hardest thing for me is being unable to visit my partner who lives in a different continent. i hope people continue to be safe and conscious even though the vaccine is here and numbers are generally going down. im looking forward to things being somewhat back to normal, although i dont think that will be for a while. i want my family to stay safe as it quite tiring to be worrying about them and myself.
