I feel odd... over the last year I’ve come to embrace quiet family weekends at home and not having to rush out the house to work and school. I miss some friends and family but I don’t miss constantly being busy and having to please everyone. I feel worried about the potential impact still on my business but also like there may be a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope we can have a family holiday this year and birthday parties for my children. They are much more resilient than we give them credit for!
