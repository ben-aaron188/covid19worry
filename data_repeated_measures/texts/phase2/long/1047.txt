Currently I feel excited and happy about the roadmap boris has come out with for the next few months.

The thought of being able to see family and friends again so close in the future is amazing. Especially with it being 3 weeks away until we can see 6 other people in our gardens.

I haven’t seen my dad in over a year and he lives almost 3 hours away, so I’m super excited to be able to go and see him. 

We’ve been living with this for a year now and I’m so ready for things to go back to normal.

I’m not sure how much longer this can go on, but it gives me hope, hope for a better future and better summer.
