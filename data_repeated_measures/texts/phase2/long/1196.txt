I feel both drained and hopeful about the current coronavirus situation. It is draining hearing constant news of death and restrictions and trying to be positive when things didnâ€™t seem to be improving. I am hopeful as we are starting to see a possible way to get nearer normality with the vaccine and warmer weather dampening the viruses efforts. It makes me feel happy just knowing there is a possibility of some freedoms returning. I feel anxious as my partner has recently been placed on furlough so we are dealing with financial implications and means that every set back with the route out of lockdown is even more upsetting and frustrating as it will start to have a financial impact on us in the near future. I am also grateful as my partner and I have been able to spend a lot more time together both with each other and with our child which has brought joy and memories we would otherwise not have had at the moment.
