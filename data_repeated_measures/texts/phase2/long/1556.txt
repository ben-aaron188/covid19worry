I feel concerned that the effort that we’re currently making won’t be enough and we will have to be in another lockdown again at some point.
I feel anxious about the vaccine and it’s long term effects.
I feel anxious about being released back into normality.
I feel worry about how my children will come out of this time.
I feel trapped and unable to see how to regain my normal life back. The idea of going back to work and going out feels daunting.
I worry about the long term effects of those having had coronavirus and what it will do to us as a population.
