I feel sad that there have been so many deaths, but also feeling hopeful as more people get vaccinated. It’s been a scary year and I hope we are finally on the up. I have been abit anxious about the virus and vulnerable members of my family, and those who are most at risk. It’s just turned the world upside down and has been hard times for everyone. It’s uncertain times and uncertain future, and for the population as a whole. I hope that we can get back on track and get back to normality sooner rather than later
