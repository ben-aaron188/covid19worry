I feel like it’s starting to come to an end, I feel drained and tired of living the same day everyday. But I am well and healthy. Covid-19 just feels like a part of my life now, I’ve learnt to live with it. I do really miss my old life though, going out and having fun with friends. I think about past memories and future ones to come once this is al over. I’m grateful I never got unwell and contracted the virus and even more grateful none of my family members did. The pandemic is really effecting my motivates toon at university though, I’m struggling to keep focus and maintain my standard of work
