I feel stressed and my skin has taken the brunt of that.
I have no open and go no more as we're not allowed out and what makes it worse is the cold days.
My anixety when I do the weekly food shop is through the roof as most people ain't social distancing or wearing masks. Or if they do wear masks they have there nose hanging out. I hate going out and I've turned into a hermit when I was usually the girl who never stayed in.
I feel tired all the time and all I seem to be doing is being a coach potato.
