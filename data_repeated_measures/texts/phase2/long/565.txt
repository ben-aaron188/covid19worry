I am weary of the whole situation, as are probably most people - it seems to have gone on for so long. I do accept that it is just one of those things, as there will always be pandemics occasionally, whatever we do to try and prevent them. I am very tired and stressed and in need of a break - my situation is that I am a single parent of a teenager and also care for my elderly father (who has dementia) at home. Usually I have respite breaks where my dad goes into a care home for a week or so and I and my son can have a break from the situation. This has obviously not been possible due to the virus being so prevalent in care homes (my elderly cousin died of Covid in one in January) - it has been too risky to take the chance Also, if there was an outbreak while dad was in one, we would not be allowed to get him back out. So we have just had to cope. I'm so relieved, however, that we seem to be coming towards the end of this - dad has had his vaccine, and I have just been offered it. So I am tentatively looking forward to the summer - better times are hopefully around the corner.
