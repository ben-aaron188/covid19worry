I am a bit more relaxed now that we see that the end is possibly in sight. I am looking forward to doing lots of things I've missed such as seeing my friends, having a pint, seeing my collegues at work. I am still worried though about the economy and I think we will be paying this debt off for the next few years. I am therefore worried about it the impact for the future, my retirement and also for my children and their future.
I a also relaxed because it is Saturday and it's the weekend so that has an impact as well
