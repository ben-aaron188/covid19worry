I am slightly concerned about the corona situation and worried that things may get worse again with new variants. But most of my immediate family Have been vaccinated or will be vaccinated very soon which was my main concern and so a large proportion of my worry has subsided. As the infection rates are so low in my area this also puts my mind at ease. I still find myself paranoid about cleaning surfaces/deliveries though and I will not be happy meeting with anyone until my family have built up immunity from the vaccine.
