I feeling so stressful, I’m afraid about myself and my family and my friends. I take care about my family but still angry about this situation in the world. I still asking myself when it’ll be normal. I want to be healthy and care about it but the virus is everywhere and I can’t do anything. This is so stressful for me . My partner is working around so many people and has the risk , when he’s coming back to home I’m afraid about my son and myself. We aware public spaces or we keeping distance but the other people don’t care about this.
