I feel worried about how this will affect my degree, and I’m scared I’ll fail the year. I’m looking forward to things opening up again, and being able to see my friends. It feels like the end is in sight, but I’m often anxious and sad about my current situation, and angry at how much time has been wasted. I wish I could’ve had a normal last two years at university, and I wish I could’ve seen my friends before they graduated. I hope that the vaccine rollout goes well, I want to be able to see all my friends again this summer.
