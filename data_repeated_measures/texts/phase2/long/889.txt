Im really annoyed how badly the government have reacted with multiple lockdowns etc. A lot of this could have been avoided and they’re all liars. I am sad how long it’s been since I saw family. I’m also sad it’s coming up to my second lockdown birthday. I am impressed how fast people are being vaccinated and I am excited to see family again when I can. I hope that the timeline stays the same and we can have a normal summer. I feel sorry for those who have less of a support network than me. I am glad this has caused a shift in working from home post-pandemic being the new normal at my workplace
