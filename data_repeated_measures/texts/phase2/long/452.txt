I am frustrated and angry about the fact that my life has been put on hold for almost a year due to the lockdown, but a little hopeful that with the vaccine the situation will finally go back to normal. I'm also worried about the long-term financial impact of the government support measures taken in the last few months. I feel annoyed by the people who supported and still support the lockdown, especially those that refuse to consider its social and economic damage, and closer to the people who did not. I generally feel less connected to the people around me than I used to before the lockdown. I miss seeing, visiting and interacting in person with my colleagues, friends and family.
