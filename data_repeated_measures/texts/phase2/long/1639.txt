I feel happier knowing many people have been vaccinated- including my parents, and that the vaccine will be available to more people soon. 
I am thankful none of my family members were affected by coronavirus.


Also knowing there are plans for lockdown to end in the next few months makes me feel better too- although I do feel anxious about life after the pandemic since we have been indoors for so long now away from people. I haven't been out of the house much since the first lockdown last year.
