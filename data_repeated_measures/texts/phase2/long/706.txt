i feel upset that i’ve missed of most of my younger adult years and i feel extremely lonely and miss my family and friends. I also feel anxious about when things are allowed to return to normal but now i see the light at the end of the tunnel and am looking forward to the future. I feel like i’m going to try and live life to the fullest as i have had a lot of time to reflect on my past self and feel like i should have appreciated the smaller things in life a lot more. I plan to take every opportunity as it comes and make the most of everything by travelling and seeing the world, and never saying no to making plans with friends and family. i appreciate everything a lot more nowadays
