I am relieved we seem to have a way through it but so sad that it came too late for so many and, in particular, two much loved family members. I feel a little angry it took them but mostly numb to feelings other than a deep sadness.  Covid has robbed us of our lives for the last year and has now robbed us of our loved ones as well. I am fearful that it will take others in the family before they are vaccinated or that the vaccine wonâ€™t be enough to protect us. 

I am worried that opening things up again will cause a further rise in infections but at the same time I know it needs to happen so that we can test the efficiency of the vaccine. I think a lot of people will still be too scared to start living life normally again and it will be a long time before people will feel safe enough to stop wearing masks when near others or indoors with strangers. Some businesses will never open again
