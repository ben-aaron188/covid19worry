It's been a difficult year, but there's definitely a bright side, and things are beginning to look up for the better now. My parents have had their first vaccines, so they're in a much better position than they were a year ago, and a lot safer for it too. I'm currently preparing to get back onto campus for university, and seeing how things go from there. Things will get better soon, I'm trying to remain optimistic - especially since around this time last year we were all in so much uncertainty about everything to do with the virus, it's nice to know that now there's a bit more certainty and security with life.
