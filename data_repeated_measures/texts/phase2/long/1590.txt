I am not afraid of getting the virus but I am afraid of how it has changed the world. I have no motivation to work, exercise etc. My family live in Ireland and I am working in the Uk. It’s currently not legal t fly home to visit my family and I do not know when I will see them again. 

I have been working from home for a year now. My apartment is very  small and some days due to the volume of work I have I do not get to leave the house for air. 

I am currently single and feel like I’m losing time to meet a husband and have a family. I also really miss socialising and being able to go to the gym.
