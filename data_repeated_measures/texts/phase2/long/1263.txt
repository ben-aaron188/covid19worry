I feel as though people are getting 'used' to the coronavirus and are starting to accept that it will be a part of daily life for the foreseeable future and possibly forever.  

People are starting to do more and once allowed to by the government they will not hesitate to do what they did previously, before the coronavirus.   

I do believe there is a large majority of people who are not worried about the coronavirus and how it will affect them (maybe they haven't had any personal experience i.e. someone close to them dying!)  

This morning I took my son to school.  The lack of social distancing was a disgrace.  One example was a couple of mother's standing in the middle of the pavement, having a conversation with people struggling to get by them.   It's infuriating.  I could have started an argument with about 4 or 5 people on the walk to school.  

I can't stand the way these people are and how they are behaving.
