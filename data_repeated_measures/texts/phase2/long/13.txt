I am hoping that the rate doesnt go up as soon as the children go back to school. I am worried that they will see that the vaccine doesnt work as well as they think it does. I am not sure how long it will be until I am prepared to go back to the life I had before as I am still scared of catching covid. 
There will be another lockdown son. They keep lifting measures too soon. They listen to the public instead of us listenijg to them. Other countries are much more strict and getting better results. We should have a full tough lockdown.
