I'm sad because it doesn't let me see my family, I miss them so much and I feel I may never see them again. The world has changed so much and I don't ever know if we will get back to normal again. I must my normal life back again. Like really I do. How will it go back to normal? Businesses are closing left, right and centre. People's anxiety are through the roof and mental health is being affected by all this. The world needs to come together and embrace all that are suffering from this pandemic.
