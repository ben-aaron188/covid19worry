I am cautiously optimistic that the vaccine will actually work and that we will be back to some form of normal by the middle of the year. i am trying not to get too excited about it and be realistic. 

i am conernced of not learning from mistakes last year and re opening too quickly, but now that the vaccines are going v quickly hopefully this mitigates that risk.

i will feel a lot happier when everyone i know has had the vaccine, myself included. 

i am not sure if i would vaccinate my child however.
