I don't feel as scared and anxious as I did over the last few months. The vaccines have helped me feel we may be back to normal in a few months. I miss my friends and family and I miss just doing things like going to the pub or to the shops. I feel sad and sorry for those who have lost loved ones and/or their livelihoods. It has made me appreciate how lucky I am to have my health and financial security. I am looking forward to a sense of closure/normality in the near future, however I hope some changes remain, such as working from home.
