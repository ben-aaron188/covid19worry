Right now, I am quite angry. Angry at the government for the catastrophic failures which have caused untold suffering. Angry at 'people', I'm the one who gets disgusted looks for distancing around groups of older people gathered on town benches having a good old natter, whilst my husband is shielding. Angry at parents who think it's now OK to gather around the streets after school to have chat, blocking both routes away from the school. Mostly I'm angry at society... not ONCE have I seen examples of patience of others, understanding or a shred of decency, to be honest. I've been sworn at, shouted at, and on one occasion almost assaulted- all for following the rules.
I have lost my faith in humanity.
