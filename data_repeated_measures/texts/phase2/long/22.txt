I am optimistic that there is light at the end of the tunnel and I hope that we can avoid a third wave, but suspect there will be one. But what really worries me and makes me anxious is how different the ""new normal"" will be once vaccinations are done and lockdown is finally lifted. I hope that we can get back to our old lifestyle, but fear that may have gone for ever, with lives lost, businesses closed, relationships changed and new ongoing restrictions introduced, such as vaccination passports etc.
