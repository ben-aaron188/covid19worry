i am still feeling  a little anxious at the current situation  but less than this time last year but my more concern for my son who has asthma than myself.i am definitley ready to get back to seeing people again, living in a different town from all my friends and family has made the situation extremely difficult. the tier system does not allow us to visit them which has been very hard on me and especially my son unfortunately it would appear that the tier system will remain in place for the significant future.
