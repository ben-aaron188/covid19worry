I feel things are improving and the end is in sight but there has been unnecessary loss due to bad management of the situation by the government. They acted too little too late initially and human lives were lost because of that. I personally have not lost anyone close but know it has had a huge impact on many around me. I am relieved that the vaccine has been distributed effectively and seems to be working well. Hopefully we will be able to continue living a Normal life soon. I am getting bored if Netflix and doing the same thing every evening.
