I’m sick and tired of feeling the way I am feeling, coping or trying to cope with things without my family and being fobbed off by a government that seems to make bets rather than actually trying to make things better for people and their mental health. There has been clearly a number of failures, probably countless failures on their behalf yet we are asked to trust them now. I miss my family, putting something in place like a daily test for covid could help people reunite and improve their mental health but instead, it’s just lies and half truths always.
