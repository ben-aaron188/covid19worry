Due to the vaccine there is some light at the end of the tunnel, but we are still under-lockdown and I have noticed lots of people not wearing masks in shops and generally getting to close with no regard to social distancing. I've heard a lot of fake news about Covid19 and people are still acting as though it is a government construct to bring about the 'New World Order' so there needs to be better communication of the facts.  People are still getting ill and dying and the prospect of spending another birthday under-lockdown doesn't appeal to me.  I've been told I've been reclassified into the 'clinically extremely vulnerable category,' and been told I need to stay in after a year of not being told that, so I feel perplexed as to why this wasn't told to me earlier and a little incredulous about the fact that I've been having to shop for myself and now suddenly the local council are telling me they can help me, just as things are improving infection-wise.
