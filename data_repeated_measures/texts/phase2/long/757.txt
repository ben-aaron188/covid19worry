It is improving and we have our jabs on Sunday, very grateful we live in the UK rather than the eu.  We have succeeded where the eu have failed and then they have tried to blame it on us which is ridiculous.  Yes, we could have done better at the start, but now we are streets ahead of the idiots within the eu.  I cannot write much more, you have the idiots that do not think the rules apply to them obviously, like the SNP MP Margaret Ferrier, sure Sturgeon paid her to go to Westminster on the train and try to spread it around in England, she risked lives by doing what she did.
