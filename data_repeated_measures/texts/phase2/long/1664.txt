Feel positive towards the fact that vaccines are being given to a lot of people on a daily basis. However, I do feel that people will suddenly think that once they have a vaccine that they can't get Covid, which isn't true. I still see a lot of people disregarding social distancing, and this makes me slightly annoyed. I've found that a lot of people are complaining about others during covid, but don't actually follow the rules themselves. I believe there are still quite a lot of hurdles and challenges to get through before life gets back to 'normal' e.g. convincing anti vax people to vaccinate, as well as certain bubbles of the population.
