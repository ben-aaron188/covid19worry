Things in my country are slowly improving day by day, vaccinations are starting to take affect and the government are actually doing a decent job of getting them out to people, we have been given dates for the ending of lockdown, granted everything goes to plan, so I think the whole country is feeling optimistic and excited about the future. It's a feeling I dont think i've felt before, I feel like I can get my life back to normal and back on track, the same feeling I'm sure is with others too. We just have to make sure to stick to the restrictions in place and take care around others, the last thing this country needs is another lockdown.
