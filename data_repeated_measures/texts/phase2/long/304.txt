I do feel very sad because of the all people who are with the virus and a fighting for their lives. Also do feel very sad for these that can't pay for their bills and food. A bit worried as the whole world is going crazy and more people a having mental problems, but can't get help.
Finally I do feel sorry for all the children because it is like a stolen childhood for them. Feel sorry for all the people as they can't meet their relatives.  I do have one hope that all this will end soon and we'll go to normal again as this is not a normal life.
