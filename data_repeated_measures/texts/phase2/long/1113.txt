Very optimistic about humanity's ability to overcome Covid-19 with vaccines. Cautiously planning some return to international travel and normal society. I feel a kind of justified cynicism with regard to the actions of the UK government, which has made a mess of almost everything before succeeding with its vaccination programme (which is really the NHS's programme). I feel very sorry for young people, especially those whose careers have been blighted, often before they've got started. I'm using the lockdown to learn new skills - piano and German - but finding it hard to focus.
