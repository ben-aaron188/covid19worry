I feel more positive about the situation now that so many people have been vaccinated. I personally have not been, so I still feel anxious about going out. I am appalled by the way the government has ""handled"" this crisis, which makes me angry. I feel very sad that so many people have died unnecessarily.

I am looking forward to returning to work, but hope to have the vaccine before that happens.

I think that the government should tread very carefully so that we don't end up with another lockdown later in the year.
