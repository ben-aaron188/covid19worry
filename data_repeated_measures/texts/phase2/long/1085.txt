I feel a bit hopeful as I will be getting my first vaccination shot this week. I also feel frustrated that things have not opened up yet in my area here in Aberdeenshire where the numbers are very low. I also am fed up with such emphasis on the schools whilst the rest of society is suffering. I am hopeful that this time next year we will be back to a bit more normal life. I am angry at those who had flouted the rules and continue to do so as it has meant longer in lockdown for all of us. The thought of getting back out there once things open is also a bit more daunting. Will I be safe? will there be another lockdown? How will I adjust after staying home for so long. I am very sad that corona virus has stopped me seeing my family for over a year now. I miss them.
