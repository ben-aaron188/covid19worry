Concerned that lockdown is opening too soon with children back in schools with unvaccinated staff members. I’m concerned that the positive steps we’ve worked towards will be undone because of a rush for a Big Bang reopening. I’m also concerned that older people are taking more risks and putting more pressure on family members to break restrictions because they’ve had one dose of the vaccine. There seems to be very little regard for keeping younger people safe and recognising the role younger school age children have in spreading the disease amongst under 40s.
