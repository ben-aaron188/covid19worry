At the moment I am really sick of Corona virus, I feel it has taken over peoples live and has now gone on so long! 
I want life to go back to normal and try and have some of our lives back. It has massively impacted my childrenâ€™s lives and their education and also the impact of not seeing their families. My job has been put on hold as I work in a school, I had received a promotion not long before the first lockdown happened. Then it happened and I feel I never had time to show myself. Which I very frustrating. My husband also works for the NHS and he has been working extremely long hours, which has resulted in him not seeing the kids much which we understand but it is really hard.
