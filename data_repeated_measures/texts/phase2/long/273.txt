I feel that despite keeping everything safe some people will mess up again and break the rules and we will get a third lockdown. I also hope my family who lives abroad may get illness and also I don't know how long to wait until to travel to my home land.

I hope my daughter don't have side effects of this pandemic as she said was fine but I wonder if she is telling the truth because she knows I worry.

I hope colleagues are nice when we are back to the office because now I feel they try to avoid me.
