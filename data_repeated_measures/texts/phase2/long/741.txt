Anger and frustration at the incompetence shown by the UK government in their shambolic handing of the pandemic. Dithering and acting too late time and time again. Appalled by the cronyism of PPE contracts awarded to firms who produced not for for purpose equipment. The lies. Putting political expedience above public health. Ignoring the scientific community. And above all the sadness of so many unnecessary deaths, so many families grieving; and gratitude to the selfless dedication of unrewarded NHS staff.
