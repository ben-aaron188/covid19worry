I feel utterly drained by the situation and can still no real end of it all. I am angry at those who think they can carry on and ignore the rules, they are selfish and I'm fed up of them all. If everyone worked together maybe we could have already ended this! I wish the world was as it was and I'm so sad that I can't see my family at the moment as I miss them so much and it has been so long since I saw them last. It just gets me down and the anxiety I've been feeling has been off the charts, I no longer sleep properly which in itself is highly frustrating.
