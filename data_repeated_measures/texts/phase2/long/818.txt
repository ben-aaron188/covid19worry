Anger towards Chinese dishonesty. Inability of the UN to organise anything and EU bungling of the vaccine roll out. UK was poor to start but got better with the vaccine. I am very disappointed that politics has taken over the supply and access of the vaccine to poor countries. It is predicable that greed has benefited greatly from friends in govt. opportunities being passed lucrative contracts - this is especially so in the UK. Friends of friends in the Tory party should be investigated to see if criminal links can be established and cases prosecuted.
