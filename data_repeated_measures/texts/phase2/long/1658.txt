I am frustrated that the choices the government are making, to move the UK out of lockdown, don't seem to be considerate of what we have learned from what has happened previously. I am anxious because children are returning to schools without being vaccinated, despite them previously being referred to as ""super spreaders"". I am worried that we are making steps that will lead to the NHS becoming overwhelmed again and that there will be more deaths. I am upset that the government seem to see these deaths as numbers on a graph, rather than individuals with lives, families, dreams and aspirations - which are just as important as theirs.
