Worried because my elderly mother is in hospital after a heart attack, she’s 88 and I don’t know what will happen. My father died and now my mum might die, my aunt has just died and my uncle is dying. Life isn’t great. My son has been investigated for cancer. What else can I say? I work in a school and have been in all year since March 2020 and do personal care for a child with special needs, social distancing is impossible. I have to work in three different bubbles. My son goes back to full time school next week, he has asthma and his immune system isn’t great, neither of us are vaccinated. I can’t see my daughter as she can’t do a support bubble because she doesn’t live in the same town. I miss her terribly.
