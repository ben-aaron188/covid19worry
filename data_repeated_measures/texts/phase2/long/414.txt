I feel like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel but I also feel like there may be another peak or issue. I also feel anxious about returning to my pre covid life as I have enjoyed working from home and having a slower pace of life. I feel that I am different from other people in that respect. Most people want to return to their pre covid life. It has made me realise that life is too short and I am not really living. I feel like I need to change a lot of things in my life but I don't know how to go about it.
