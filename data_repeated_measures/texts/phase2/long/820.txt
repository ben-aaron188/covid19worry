I think it’s an absolute joke! We just need to get on with this now and learn to live with it. I am being penalised because I’m young and am not having the jab and I work in a primary school with 4 year olds. We can not social distance. Yet I know someone younger than me who works in an SEN school who social distances more than me who can have it. I also know people who work in social care but are working from home who have had it. How is that fair?  I won’t be able to go on holiday because I haven’t had the jab and places will only let you go if you’ve had both. More people die each year of the normal flu and of other illnesses. Why has this much destruction happened for something this minute?
