I am unhappy that people seem to flout the coronavirus guidelines and restrictions as this will put us all back at getting out of lockdown. It is also worrying how long covid is affecting some people who are not vulnerable.
The economy is also struggling and I think it will get a lot worse before it gets better which will be horrible for everyone. There will be lots more unemployment and people will lose their homes and everything they have worked hard for. More people will go hungry and the number of children in poverty will go up. It is a very stressful time for everyone and it needs to end soon otherwise we will have a mental health pandemic instead.
