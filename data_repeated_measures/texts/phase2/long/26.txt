I am optimistic about the future and I feel like the worst of the UK's coronavirus situation is over. I can't wait until people can go out again and things can return to normal more. I feel upset about all the opportunities and time we have lost, particularly as this was my last year of university and I was unable to go in and have been paying rent for nothing. I'm very excited to be able to meet friends and go out again soon. I feel a lot less worried now because my parents are being vaccinated very soon and It's very positive that covid cases and deaths are decreasing considerably now. I hope that more is done in the future to help our NHS and try and stop this happening again.
