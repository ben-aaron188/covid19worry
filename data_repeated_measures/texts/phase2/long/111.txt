I am so sad and also angry at how the situation has been mishandled. I am angry that people are catching Covid in the hospitals (this happened to a relative, who then passed away). Sadly many of the health care workers we came into contact with were not trained well and were incompetant.  This is terrible in a country which should not be under-resourced. I am angry that the government has made too many mistakes. I used to work abroad a lot so I feel very restricted but also nervous about things opening up again.
