I'm starting to get a bit fed up and annoyed about corona virus. It has almost been around for a full year now and we're now in a lockdown again. But hopefully the new road map will give a rough idea of how things are going to go. I'm. Just annoyed and upset about how the last year Has been wasted and could of done alot more with our lives. But hopefully more people are able to get vaccinated over the next Couple months and there's hope that therw will be some improvement and normality at some point in the near future
