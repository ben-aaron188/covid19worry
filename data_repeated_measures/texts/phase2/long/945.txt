More optimistic because I have been vaccinated and so have my colleagues in the NHS. Some of my older friends have also been vaccinated. My daughter hasn't and returns to school next week so I might feel mild anxiety about that and about other friends who are younger and have longer to wait. However I live in area where infection rates are low - people need to continue to be sensible however. That is really important. So I feel cautious, slightly anxious, a bit uplifted by spring and things starting to progress out of lockdown. But this optimism is tentative. I feel grateful to be healthy and that those close to me have not been seriously ill, grateful that things could have been much worse but thankfully weren't in our area. A little weary of lockdown and the restrictions on social life.
