I feel like it has been greatly overblown by the media and authorities. At present I do not feel like any government will allow us to return to normality and any promises made about not infringing on people's freedoms are now obsolete. I feel more concerned about the possible dictatorship-like measures that might become reality than the virus itself (e.g. outrageous things such as vaccine passports and other subtle sanctions on people who don't wish to be forced into anything). In my view, perfecting treatments will eventually produce greater results in battling the virus than overrelying on a vaccine as if it's humanity's saving grace
