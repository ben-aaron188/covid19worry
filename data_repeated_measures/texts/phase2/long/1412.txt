It's hard to be optimistic in regards to the pandemic. Over the last year there has been a lot of conflicting information. I've sort my information from medical experts but many people, who don't research, just get the conflicting information. This has lead to a distrust of facts. I've received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine but I'm still fearful of possible infection, especially with new variants popping up. I've spent the past year locked indoors apart from medical appointments, this is due to being diabetic and vulnerable. I'm stressed, anxious and more depressed than normal. A lack of money or anything to do has left me climbing the walls. I wanted to study a new course but I've found it hard to concentrate.
