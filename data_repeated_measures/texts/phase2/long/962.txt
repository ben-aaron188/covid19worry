At this time I feel confident in the corona situation with vaccines now being administered. I fully support vaccinations and praise how quickly they have been administered. 
The spread is very low in my area and my workplace are taking great precautions to protect their employees. They have provided training and also provide PPE (I work in a special school).
I support the government in prohibiting travel and remaining focused in still stopping the spread.  I fully support mask wearing and social distancing and would be concerned if these precautions were scrapped too soon.
