I feel stressed and frustrated that the coronavirus pandemic is still an issue. I also feel some anger and sadness that we are still unable to do things that we all used to enjoy, and I do feel the Government is hugely responsible for this in how they handled the lockdown situations. However, there is some relief that there's light at the end of the tunnel now of leaving lockdown but anxiety remains over the safeness and reliability of the vaccines available. It's been a stressful time for everyone, and there is some anxiety and fear of how we will recover from this.
