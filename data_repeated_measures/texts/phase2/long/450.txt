I feel sad that it feels it has gone on for so long when compared to other countries successfully managing the pandemic more successfully than us. I feel sad for the people that have lost their lives and those that are going to be heavily impacted by a future economic downturn as a result of the pandemic and those who have already lost their jobs. Loneliness is also something I’ve been feeling more and more, I feel that maintaining friendships is harder and not being able to see family is frustrating. I do feel lucky though that I’ve been able to stay employed and haven’t been impacted by the virus and neither have my family.
