My current feelings is mostly anxiety as I suffer from depression anyway way before this pandemic so staying in and working from home is a welcome relief . I try and avoid the news as they focus on negativity too much . I see this pandemic carrying on for longer than expected for some reason , also one good thing to come out of all this is that crime levels are down and it keeps kids/gangs off the streets ect . One of the down sides is the waiting in hospitals for people with life threatening illnesses as myself have a issue with health and have had hospital appointments cancelled like many others , not that its anyones fault it's just the way it is . I believe lockdowns should carry on for a bit longer to be on the safe side .
