ANXIOUS FOR MY CHILDREN GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. i AM WORRIED FOR THEM AND HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED SO MUCH. i WISH I DIDNT HAVE TO SEND THEM BUT I WILL GET FINED IF I DONT. I REALLY FEEL FOR THEM AND I WORRY FOR THEM. I HAVENT SLEPT FOR A WEEK THINKING ABOUT IT. I KNOW THEY HAVE MISSED OUT BUT I PREFER THEM AT HOME, ESPECIALLY THE OLDER CHILDREN. ITS NOT LIKE SCHOOL , SITTING IN MASKS ALL DAY, MY DAUGHTER IS A GLASSES WEARER SO THEY STEAM UP. THEY HAVE TO WALK TO SCHOOL ALONE AND NOT TOUCH ANYONE. SAT IN A CLASS AL DAY WITH WINDOWS AND DOORS OPEN, WHEN THEY HAVE GOT USED TO SITTING IN A WARM COSY HOUSE AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE
