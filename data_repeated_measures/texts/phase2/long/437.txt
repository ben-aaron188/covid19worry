We have  been in lockdown for almost year now. A vaccine is now available and I am now feeling that the end is in sight after everyone has suffered so much.  I am now feeling optimistic. I am now feeling very positive about the future and the next year.  I am looking forward to seeing friends and family. I am excited about life returning to some form of normality before coronavirus. I am looking forward to going on holiday. I am looking forward to going out for something to eat in the restaurant. There is still uncertainty how long this will continue but we face this when we need to.
