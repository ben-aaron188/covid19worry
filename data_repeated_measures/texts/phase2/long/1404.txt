I am thankful that solutions are being made to fight against the virus with a plan to start to transition back to normal life in the summer.

However, I fear it will be increasingly difficult to find employment in an already hard city to find employment within.

I feel sadness and sorrow for all those affected by this horrible virus and with them all the best for their recovery.

I am also incredibly grateful towards the NHS for all of the consistent hard work they have done throughout the entire situation.
