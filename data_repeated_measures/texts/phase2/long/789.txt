I feel anxious about leaving lockdown after such an extended period of time but i do have a strong desire for society to return to normal.  I have already made plans in the local community to go to the local pub and celebrate the summer solstice in June.  I feel anger about the way the pandemic has been handled in thus country and of the politicians failure to own their mistakes.  I feel ready to return to normal life but am slightly scared I have lost social skills as a result of the lockdown.  I am thankful for the vaccine and my concerns about the virus are less pressing now.
