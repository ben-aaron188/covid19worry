I’m angry that people still aren’t taking things seriously. I worry that the new mutations will be resistant to the vaccine and we’ll have to start developing another and we’ll be no better than this time last year. I feel that our education system has failed us when people give more weight to Facebook opinions than to science, purely because science is too hard to understand so it must be fake. And it seems like the government puts more value in whether they’re liked than they do in making competent and consistent decisions.
