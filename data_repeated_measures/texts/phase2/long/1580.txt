I am feeling more relaxed than normal as people are being vaccinated, myself included, and i am safe at home and able to protect myself - I am shielding. On the whole, numbers are reducing at the moment, but i am concerned about returning to normal life. mostly i worry about interacting with people again as I am anxious, i worry about my routine as I currently don't have one if im honest, and addressing my ever-increasing work load which I have been ignoring due to lack of motivation is worrying me. I started a new job in the pandemic so haven't met colleagues yet and it is hard to gauge expectations over email
