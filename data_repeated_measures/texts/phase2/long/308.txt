I feel happy that things seem to be moving along with the Corona situation. It put my mind at rest when we were given a roadmap out of lockdown. I'm sad that my wedding has been cancelled twice but hopeful that I can get married later this year. I'm concerned about my finances as I've lost a lot of income due to Corona but again hopeful that I'll be able to sort that out soon. My Dad has had his vaccine so that is good news and we hopefully will get ours in the next few months. I'm looking forward to be able to go out and about again.
