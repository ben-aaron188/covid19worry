I have felt anxious throughout the pandemic and even with the vaccine, I still feel worried about catching covid, especially being high risk. I worry about sending my son to school and have been shielding for the best part of a whole year now. I miss seeing my family and friends and I worry about my son missing out too, especially as he’s an only child and hasn’t been able to socially interact due to covid.
I feel anxious about all my relations, but especially the older ones who would be far more at risk if they were to contact covid
