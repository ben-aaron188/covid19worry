I am feeling so fed up with corona. I feel like it is never going to end. I haven't seen my family since 2019 and it is just hard. I wish life would return to normal as it has affected my mental health significantly. It is a very scary Time because my family members who I haven't been able to see have had the illness too and it is hard. It is hard on my daughter as she misses school tremendously and she is only 4 so doesn't understand and she also has special needs so she is struggling even more with her learning, and not being at school has made her even more behind
