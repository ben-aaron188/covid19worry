At the moment I feel quite passive about the corona situation. The vaccine results seem very good and I am looking forward to getting mine- although quite nervous. I wish that all the people who have died could have been saved with the vaccine earlier but I am proud that the Oxford team have been able to produce the vaccine so quickly. I do worry about variants.  I get annoyed when I see neighbours flouting the lockdown rules. I am looking forward to starting work again (self employed) and getting back to some sort of normality.
