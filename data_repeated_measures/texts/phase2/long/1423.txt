I feel very anxious, worried about the situation for my immediate family and especially older members. I am very concerned as I haven’t yet had the vaccine but I am very close to getting it as it is currently being offered to over 60’s and I am 50. I teach adults and some don’t believe it exists and have said they won’t have the vaccine. I want to keep my distance from people until I have had the vaccine. I have two boys who will return to school next week after the 3rd lockdown as I will also return to the classroom and hence risks increase.
