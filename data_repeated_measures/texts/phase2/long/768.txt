I feel completely drained throughout all these lockdowns, I don't feel worried about COVID anymore, just angry at how its been handelled and how I still feel in the same situation as before. I feel sad and I don't feel like I can really ever properly recover from all this. There is nothing to look forward too, even with things opening up it still feels properly unreal. Everyday is blurring into one and I've lost any structure with my life, equally I do not want to return to 'the way things were'
