At this very moment I feel a little calmer because we have been in this pandemic for over a year now and I am still doing all the things I need to do in order to limit myself from catching the virus, however I am a little angry that people are becoming blase to this virus. I am seeing people not wearing masks, not giving way, not giving space and meeting up in ridiculous groups now more than ever. I also feel like the people who have had the vaccine have this inferior likeness about them as if they may not ever catch the virus ever again.
