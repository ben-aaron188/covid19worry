I feel slightly angered and annoyed because I want shops to open up so I can carry on with my life. I would like to actually attend uni and no be at home. My whole first year was done at home and the teaching was horrendous. There is no actual support and mental health is deteriorating. Covid had a large impact on me and my family with family deaths and right now I just want it all to end so I can get back to living like the student I want to be living like and actually go and make uni friends which is extremely difficult to be doing from home as of this moment.
