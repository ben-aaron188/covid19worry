I am anxious about the financial implication that corona will have on us my workplace recently announced 2,000 job cuts and there’s not a lot of other jobs out there. I am saddened and anxious at how much time my son has missed from school I know he’s behind and I’ve really really struggled I have worked from home throughout taking on more job tasks due to furlough but still expected to teach at home my son needs motivating so needs my attention which I can’t give whilst working I feel terribly guilty about thus really really guilty but I have tried my best. I am anxious that we will be forced to go back into the office full time home schooling aside I have enjoyed working from home it’s saved so much money on fuel and childcare. In terms of the disease itself I’m hopeful I really believe in the vaccine, I caught corona virus in January of this year and although I felt poorly for 10 days I was okay and I’m kind of relieved it’s over and done with. I can really see light at the end of the tunnel with the relaxation plan the government has released it makes me happy to know socialisation will be back very soon I will be back to the gym it’s like the end of a dark period and I won’t take basic things like hugging relatives for granted again. We lost my grandad during the pandemic and a family friend we will get the opportunity to celebrate their lives all together properly as we couldn’t at the funeral with social distancing etc. It is like the dawn at the end of a dark night I think a lot of people feel hope and a gratitude
