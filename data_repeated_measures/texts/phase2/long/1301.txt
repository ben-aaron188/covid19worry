I am feeling completely and utterly fed up with Covid 19. I resent having to give up so much of my normal life and resort to attempting to teach my children and leave my job to do a teaching job which I am useless at. I am also fed up with not seeing any of my friends or family for over a year and living within the same walls for the majority of my time. I didn't appreciate how much freedom I have in my life and to have it curtailed due to government restrictions has been a shock. I understand why these lockdown restrictions are necessary but I feel that these have to come to an end and that normal day life has to start at some point.
