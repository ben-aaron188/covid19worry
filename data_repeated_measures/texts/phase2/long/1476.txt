I am feeling okay regarding the situation as a whole, my family have all had their first jab so that has relaxed me about working in a school. However, I am now just feeling fed up and sad about staying inside and not being able to do things or go anywhere on my days off, even if that is popping into my village for a coffee. I am not angry any more about decisions made, I understand that it must have been hard to make decisions on something no one knew anything about, it is just annoying that decisions are still not being met (e.g. shutting of the borders), that could mean we can be 'free' for longer and safer. I personally would much prefer to travel within the UK and boost our economy if it meant there would be fewer lockdowns than to travel abroad.
