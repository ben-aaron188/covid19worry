I'm still anxious. Many people behave like they are fine with the situation, but circumstances are still the same. Deadly virus is flying around. We are not vaccinated, vaccine is not working in 100 percent, virus have more and more variants, so nothing really changed. I'm frustrated, have enough and I worry a lot. I would like this to be over and I'm angry, because it could be of people would behave and have some common sense. I'm also frustrated, because I see many people (online) that are denying the virus, it's possible outcome or vaccination program. I'm sad that there is so many things that we cannot do or miss out.
