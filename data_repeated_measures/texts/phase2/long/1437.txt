Before a lot of people were getting covid 19 and there was no solution for it so I felt very sad and anxious. However, now I feel relieved since millions of people in the United Kingdom are getting vaccinated furthermore the R value is below one at the moment. Also not only in the United Kingdom but a lot of people in the other countries are also getting vaccinated so hopefully the world will be free of the covid 19 virus. Hence I believe we will be able to go back to our normal daily lives soon.
