I am very nervous that it is still going on, I miss going out and seeing my friends and going to restaurants.
I want lockdown to be over, I really need a holiday and a break from work. Work has been so hectic at the moment can't even leave the house. 
The vaccine needs to work so we can go back to our normal life's, been nearly one year since we went into lockdown.
Since we went into lockdown last year I have been working from home on a daily basis and not hair a hair cut in 4 months now.
Government is going too slow on opening shops and restaurants
