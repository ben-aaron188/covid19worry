As of this moment, I feel very frustrated and tired of this whole situation. I have had enough, and now, even more than a year ago, I feel it heavier than ever. Even though things seem to be slightly improving, I find it hard to see an ending to this. I am worried I got used too much to be isolated and restricting myself from doing things I would have normally done without even thinking about it. I don't think there will be a return to the normal we knew before. I am also worried these restrictions, especially vaccine-wise, won't allow me to visit family in my home country for a long time.
