At this very moment I feel little to no tension regarding the coronavirus situation. The cases are low in my area and I always adhere to the social distancing guidelines when going out, along with always wearing a mask. The vaccine is just around the corner so I don't think there is much to worry about. Compared to last year when the cases were higher I haven't changed my mindset too much, since I would always wear a mask and follow the social distancing guidelines. I do think, however, that the pandemic has lasted far longer than it should have, and would have been over much sooner if the general public were a little more obedient.
