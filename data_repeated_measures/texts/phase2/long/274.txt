I feel frustrated by the way the Government are acting and have acted . I am worried about the kids returning to school  too early and all together .I am  annoyed that the kids  have to test themselves . I hate the way the govenment brag about the vacination success but choose to ignore all the mistakes they keep on making. I can never see how life will return to normal. I worry about all the education the children have missed and ow the lockdown have effected them mentally. I fear that new varients will come and make lots of people ill again . I feel so sad that so many people have died and are still dying.
