I have recently had my first vaccination jab and so I guess I am feeling hopeful. I feel good about the road map set out to release us from lockdown and get back to normal. I still feel a little anxiety for my friends and relatives that have not had their vaccine yet and for those that havenâ€™t had it but the country starts opening up more as this will put them at more risk. I am slightly fearful of the new strains and whether the vaccine will protect against them and if not whether I will have to have further vaccines when they develop them.but I am still very  hopeful that we are on our way out of the pandemic this year.
