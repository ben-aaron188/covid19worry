Fed up with lockdowns. Want some certainty back. Exasperated with the government over some of their decisions which I feel put the economy before people. I feel conflicted about the need for life to get back to normal versus peoples right to choose eg to have the vaccine or not. Not sure I trust the government. Feeling sad for people who have lost loved ones, or who are unable to see loved ones. I desperately want to be able to travel to see my mum, and other friends. It seems like this has dragged on for years. Am concerned about the new policing bill that is being read in parliament and how force was used to break up a masked vigil being held for Sarah Everad.
