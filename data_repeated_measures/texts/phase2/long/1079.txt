I feel frustrated that we are still experiencing the lockdown, but I do feel hopeful about the end of lockdown being around the corner.
I feel guilty as I have been socialising probably more than has been advised, but I have felt this necessary to get through the difficult situation.
I am worried for my family still but I am relieved that my parents, parents-in-law and grandma have had their first vaccines. 
Work is stressful but I am enjoying working at home more than I thought I would. 
I am excited to start making plans with friends again, to book restaurants and go to shops.

I don’t think I’ll feel ‘normal’ again until we don’t have to wear facemasks in public again. That has been stressful and makes me feel claustrophobic.
