I feel optimistic about the current situation with the vaccine roll out. I also feel that if the population are willing to accept the current rules we will return to some form of normality. People should understand that this will never go away and COVID will be with us and the possibility of annual vaccinations maybe required. The future looks more brighter than this time last year. Governments around the world should also help other countries that do not have the infrastructure that other countries have to help them with there vaccine roll outs.
