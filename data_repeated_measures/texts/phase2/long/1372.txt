I feel like the situation is getting better with less cases locally and nationally, less people in our hospital and especially less people in our critical care department and more people being vaccinated, we seem to be on track with the vaccination schedule which is nice to hear but I still feel like people arenâ€™t going to follow the rules with the relaxing of lockdowns and I still feel like we are some way away from normality. I worry that we might have to enter another lockdown at some point with the news of more variants coming from different countries and with travel opening up, this is a concern for me.
