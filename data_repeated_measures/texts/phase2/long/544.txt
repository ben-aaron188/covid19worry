COVID-19 I believe has taught us and the world to be a better place. It had reminded us of the things that matter and pushes back the least important things that we have depended on prior to corona virus. 

Things like nature have became more important, things like technology have became less important. Improvements to the world have been experienced, such as less pollution by so many cars on the roads. 

I for one am thankful for this reminder and it’s made me feel a lot happier about things and myself as I’ve made it a time to focus on me and my family.
