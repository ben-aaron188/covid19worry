It gives me anxiety at the current situation which also depresses me. It also fills me with mistrust in the government, the who agency and many pharma companies. Most of the time I comply with the gov rules but some of the rules are pretty stupid and arguments are easily believable from both sides of the story. My life at the minute is mostly staying in the house where I watch tv browse online and listen to the radio or read books. Hopefully now that the vaccinations are starting to roll out we will see a major shift in the rules needed in place to enforce this virus.
