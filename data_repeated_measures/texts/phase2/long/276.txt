I feel a mixture of emotions when I think of corona virus. At the moment there is quite a bit of hope that the situation is getting under control - the vaccine roll out has helped massively to increase optimism. I also feel quite sad when thinking of the impact the virus has had, and continues to have on people's lives. It is upsetting to think how many people have died, and how restricted our lives are right now. I am fearful of the potential health impact on my family and worried about our safety before we get vaccinated
