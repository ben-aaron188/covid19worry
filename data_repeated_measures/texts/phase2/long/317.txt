Iâ€™m sometimes start to feel more hopeful that things will return to being a bit more normal but then I will perhaps see something on the news or social media about events happening in other countries and it will make me worried again about if we will ever be normal again.
The vaccine is great news but I worry about new strains and if it will be any good against them .I am lucky though that I have had work but my partner has not had so much so financially we are not doing so great but we are coping .
