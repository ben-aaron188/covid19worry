it's getting better but we're now over a year into this and a lot of things haven't really changed. i understand lockdown is important but it's still difficult to have motivation to do anything when the country is essentially turned off at the mains. Isolation is hard to deal with over a long period of time and things you'd like to do but arent allowed to do is frustrating. I'm very much looking forward to when things get back to normal or close to what once was the norm. I also hope a lot of lessons were learnt from this. I feel like we could have avoided such a long time in lockdown if things were done differently at the start.
