Corona situation dragging on and on. Happy about vaccines but precautions still heavy. New mutations are a worry. My mom aged 88 has been shielding for nearly a year now sigh. No holidays no pubs no hairdressers no restaurants no charity shops all being greatly missed. Wish we could get back to normal. National debt is horrendous worried about son losing his job. Daughter not been furloughed is a key worker subsequently caught covid still cant smell anything luckily i didnt catch it isolating with her but being mega careful ....was a strain having windows constantly open in the winter and got through 2 bars of soap handwashing
