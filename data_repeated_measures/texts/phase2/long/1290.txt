It feels like the end might be in sight but such a long road to get there. I’m likely to get the vaccine in may but that still feels a long long time away, and meanwhile my baby daughter has not met her grandparents and so many people are still dying and the NHS is running on fumes. I am sad for us all and I can’t wait for life to open u again. However those politicians who are all ‘don’t care about deaths what about the economy’ make me cross. We just have to suck it up and wait. 

I’ve been heartfelt and laid it out there and apparently this is still not 500 characters so now you get some filler I’m afraid.
