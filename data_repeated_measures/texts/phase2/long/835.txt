As we close in on a year of Coronavirus, my current feeling about the pandemic at this moment of time is that of exhaustion yet positivity. The rules in which we must abide by, in order to overcome the hard times placed upon us by the invisible enemy, have taken a toll mentally and physically on one's self. However, in times of turmoil, I do find myself in good spirit and high hopes for the future! The reduction of deaths and increased rollout of vaccinations has eased what was once fear, yet the overwhelming longevity of the virus which did not seem so bad at first; still allows for one's mind to think if we'll ever go back to normal.
