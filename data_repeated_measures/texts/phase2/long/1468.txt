but annoyed it’s taken this long for it to be fixed but glad it’s over. looking forward to a normal life again soon. at the moment i’m quite relaxed regarding corona as i don’t see it as much of a danger to me personally as i make sure to follow social distancing and other rules regarding it. i do know personally know anyone affected by the virus which probably increases my relaxed attitude of the subject. i am excited to be able to go outside again like i said previously. i have had multiple birthdays ruined by the virus, both my own and friends parties.
