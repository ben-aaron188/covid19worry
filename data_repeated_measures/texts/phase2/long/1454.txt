I’m hopeful that we can get out of this situation soon. The vaccine rollout is going really well. That’s one thing the government have done well. However I’m angry - furious - that tens of thousands of deaths could have been avoided if the government had told them to stay at home over Christmas. They didn’t do what was needed. They did what was easy. And because of that all these people died. Some family got COVID and are still suffering from long term effects. Because Boris couldn’t do what was needed of him.
