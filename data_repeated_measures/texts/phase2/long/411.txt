With things how they are right now, everything is still all over the place, although restrictions are lifting i am worried that we will go back into another lock  down. which means it has been over a year since i seen my best friend and her child and all i want to do is visit her and her family and spend some time there.
i am however happy that both sets of my grandaparents have had their vaccine in order to help fight covid, meaning that when restrictions lift fully i can go and visit them too as it has been awful not seeing them during covid especially when they are ill
