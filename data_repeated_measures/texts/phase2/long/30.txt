I didn't think the pandemic would last this long but our government haven't helped matters by delaying lockdown. The closure of shops and other travel restrictions are annoying and frustrating but I see why they are needed and I wish everyone would stick to them. Human life is more important that the economy.  I have no problem with masks and social distancing but I'm hoping that vaccination means the virus will soon be under control but I think vaccination is going to be a permanent and standard thing like vaccines children get at present . I'm not sure where the virus started.
