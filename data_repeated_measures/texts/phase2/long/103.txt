I feel sad that the pandemic has caused disruption especially to families, those who have lost loved ones, and many children who are at risk of falling behind in a divided have/have not society. I’m determined to try and make a difference for good in this as a school governor and parent. I am optimistic about our current chances to start recovery now that the vaccine distribution seems to be going well. However, I’m a little anxious about future recurring disruption and the fact that divisions within society which have been revealed and heightened by the pandemic may not be dealt with fundamentally once enough people prefer to get on with life as comfortably as possible.
