I’m anxious about the post covid world. Money worries. The vaccine has given us hope, but I do think people are going to be too relaxed and we are likely to go back into a lockdown. I can’t have that anymore. I’m lonely. I live in a family home that isn’t particularly supportive, I just really miss my friends, and hugs. I’m hopeful we’re on the way out. I’m a social butterfly and to get me through I’m working 2 jobs, I can’t stay home and do nothing. It’s been happening for too long now, I won’t take things for granted as much after covid.
