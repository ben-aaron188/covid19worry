 
I feel slightly hopeful that the government's current plan will work and we'll be able to get back to some sort of normalcy and the death rate will decrease but I feel like people are rushing things and are too ready to do things without precautions like wearing masks or keeping their distance. I feel like it's gotten to a point where the government themselves are ready to put everyone in danger if it means the economy will start moving forward again. I really hope that we're able to move forward from this pandemic but in a way that's sustainable
