I feel relaxed and safe in my home right now, having had the vaccine earlier on today.  I feel a little more hopeful for the future and getting back to normality, seeing friends and having some physical contact.  I'm looking forward to getting out of the house for a walk tomorrow, into the fresh air after being cooped up in front of one screen or another for the majority of the week.  Even though I've had the 1st dose of the vaccine, I know I still need to be socially distanced when out and about, and to wear a mask when in shops.
