I feel like throughout this whole thing the government have consistently made the wrong decisions like keeping schools open, starting lockdowns too late, ending lockdowns too early, etc. I think for the most part people are fairly used to living in lockdown now, although I think some people are almost *too* used to it, and will have trouble readjusting once normality resumes. The people who do not follow the guidance (ignoring social distancing, hand washing, mask wearing, etc) along with people opposing the vaccines are fools.
