I'm starting to feel like this whole situation will probably never end, or we'll never be back again as to how we were, I'm really confused, and my mental health is steadily deteriorating.
 I feel like everything's hard and care about other people is slowly declining, everyone is becoming a lot more self centered and empty.
It's a really tough situation, one that last year I thought it might end, but right now I'm thinking back to it and I sincerely do not know how to feel about it
 I hope this is over, with not many dead people, not many broken homes, broken people and broken mental health. 
 With people of less fortunate economical backgrounds able to stand on their feet.
Low income people are on a really tight spot right now, and it's crazy thinking that you can't go to work, but there are people also not getting paid as well with stimulus checks etc
