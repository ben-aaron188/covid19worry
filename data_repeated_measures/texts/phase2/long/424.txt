I'm very worried about schools going back and businesses re-opening.  i feel its far to early and this will end up with a spike in cases and more mutations. The government are more interested in business and their own profits (fingers in pies) than the average person. 

i fear that we are going to have to have more lock downs and more restrictions that will cause people to become more and more lethargic in their reactions to the virus.  i see people walking around in groups without masks all the time
