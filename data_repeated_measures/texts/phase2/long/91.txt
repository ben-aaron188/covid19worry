Being stuck isolating is very much a toll on my mental health. My feelings of anxiety have gone through the roof and I'm finding it quite hard. I dislike complaining though as we are doing this to help everyone and I feel determined to get through this all and work together to make it through the other side. I feel optimistic about that future and hopeful that things will return to normal. I am anxious about  my current employment though. I am struggling to get by financially but am also scared to put myself or my family at risk right now.
