I feel fairly relaxed about the current situation. I live a quiet life where I am mostly at home so day to day life is not really much different for me although I do appreciate this is not the same for everyone. As a country we are doing very well with the vaccination programme and it feels like we are getting the virus under control. 
As the pandemic wasnâ€™t something I could personally control, I have chosen to look at it from the viewpoint of what we gained from it rather than what we missed out on and am thankful for the time I got to spend at home with my partner and our children and for the time off from my job.
