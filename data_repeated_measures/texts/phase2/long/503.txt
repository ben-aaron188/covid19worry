I am angry that people have not taken the pandemic seriously enough and fell that it can’t happen to them which has resulted in the situation we are still in
People need to be mindful that this will be with us for a long time
I am annoyed that there are so many people who still don’t believe that it is real and that it is a hoax!  Until these people are proved wrong and accept that it is real there will always be issues
There is also a need to get the economy back but it needs to be done in a safe and knowledgable way and not just release everyone
