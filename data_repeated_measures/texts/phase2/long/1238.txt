Overall, I am feeling much more happy than I was during the first national lockdown in the UK (which was around April 2020). I feel confident that the end of lockdown is near, and there is a good chance they life will return to normal at some point during this year. I am looking forward to seeing people in-person and going to restaurants to eat and drink again, as this is the one thing I have missed the most during lockdown since it started. I feel much more happy than I did about 6 months ago, when things were very uncertain. The vaccine rollout is helping us all as more and more people are vaccinated.
