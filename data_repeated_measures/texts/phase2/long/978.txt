I am quite relaxed as of now due to the number of cases going down due to lockdown and the vaccine. I just hope this is all done by the end of the year. The way the government has approached this has confused me as there was no reason in opening schools which drastically increased the cases and closed after a couple of months. They should have just kept them closed until the vaccine was made to prevent all these deaths. I like the lockdown because I was able to relax and spend time with my family and luckily no one in my family has contracted covid.
