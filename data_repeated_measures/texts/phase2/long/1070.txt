I feel sad at all the things we have missed out on- spending time with family, seeing friends etc. i feel worried that everything will be returning too quickly and we will end up in another lockdown. Iâ€™ve enjoyed spending this Time with my children but worried that they have missed learning and what it will take for them to catch up. I worry that although my parents have had the vaccine that they may catch covid. I am concerned about my children finding it hard to return to school and how they will find mixing with people again.
