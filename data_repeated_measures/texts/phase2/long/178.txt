I'm still very anxious about the situation as I don't know when I will receive a vaccination. It's been very tough not being able to see family and friends. I am working from home at the moment which has been nice and a lot less stressful than going into the office with 10+ people, but I do worry about going back if I haven't had a vaccination before. Hopefully we'll be able to get back to some normality by summer, it would be really nice to start seeing people again and being able to get out of the house and go places.
