I'm hopeful with the news of 3 vaccines in the UK and how fast the government are distributing them. However, I'm worried lockdown restrictions are being lifted too soon and people will take that and the vaccine news to mean they can just go back to how things were before the pandemic and that if they do, we'll end up back where we were at the end of last year all over again. I'm also anxious to see my family again! It's been far too long since my children got to hug their grandparents and it's been far too long since we were last able to see friends.
