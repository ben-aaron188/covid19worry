The entire COVID situation is just completely and utterly frustrating and surreal. I would never have thought in a million years life would be like this. At the moment, I feel stressed and full of anxiety especially knowing this situation is not ending any time soon and the uncertainty is killing me. The uncertainty of things being able to go back to normal- whether that will ever be the case. The anxiety of what is to come- can this happen again? There are so many strains and other viruses that could potentially cause a pandemic again. It stresses me out knowing that I feel sad and lonely and very self isolated as I haven't met any friends and family- in fact I feel more disconnected to the people around me more than other. I am worried about my health and future prospects, knowing that all my plans for the future can be destroyed by it. it scares me knowing that so many people I know have died from this virus and no one is really safe.
