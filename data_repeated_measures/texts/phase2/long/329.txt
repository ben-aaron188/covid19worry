I feel that the end is near. With the uptake in vaccinations I think we will all get back to some sort of normality by the end of this year which is really great. I'm very hopeful at the moment that normal life is just around the corner. I think that everyone is looking forward to the next stages and changes in relation to lockdown rules and once things start to open up again then everything will be better. It's going to be a long road but we are going to get there by working together and doing everything we can at the moment to stay home so we can hopefully have a better 2nd half of the year
