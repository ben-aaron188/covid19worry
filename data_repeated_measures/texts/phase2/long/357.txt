I am beginning to experience fatigue with lockdown, though I still understand why it is necessary. I am also concerned that we will end up with further restrictions again if we rush through lifting restrictions. I am more sad than anything, however, as my 1 year old has missed out on many things in his life so far that I had taken for granted he would experience, such as birthday celebrations and playing with cousins etc. 
I feel like we all need to continue to be careful even after lockdown ends, though I absolutely understand the desire to ""get back to normal"".
