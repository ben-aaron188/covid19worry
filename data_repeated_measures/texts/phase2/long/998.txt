I feel incredibly sad for families who have lost loved ones as I think more people have died than was necessary.  I feel angry at the way politicians have continued to look after themselves to the detriment of the people who they should be serving.  I feel angry that the NHS staff are not better looked after and I feel very frustrated with having been locked up for so long.  I am angry that in spite of saying they will focus on data and not dates, we are given firm dates only and the lifting of lockdown is not linked to how well or badly we are doing.
