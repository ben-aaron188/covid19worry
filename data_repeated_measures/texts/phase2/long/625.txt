I feel like the government has done a very bad job managing the epidemic, it feels like the average person really doesn't matter, I am unemployed and so running out of money to live on, but at the same time I don't see why I should look for work and then risk dying from Covid, however at the same time there's no support for people in my exact situation... so I have a choice, starve, or take a public facing job and risk catching Covid... I've worked in enough businesses to also know that they don't want to spend money on adequate protection for staff...
