I feel a little bit imprisoned by the current restrictions. I am not fearful of the virus per se at this moment, although I do follow all measures strictly as I respect and acknowledge the seriousness of the current situation. I feel frustrated that it's been keeping me away from my loved ones as we do not live in the same country. I feel upset and a little bit hopeless about not being able to travel further than my own city, as well as the fact that the current restrictions really limit the number of things I get to look forward to to 'get away' from my work responsibilities.
