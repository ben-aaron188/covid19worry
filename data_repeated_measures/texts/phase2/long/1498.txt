Hopefull that we are coming to the end of this. Glad that we have kept our jobs and excited that our little girl will soon be able to play with her friends in the park, go to the zoo and the farm. Experience life as a toddler should out exploring and seeing people outside of her family. I am also looking forward to being able to travel abroad or just nip to the shops. Simple things you take for granted. I am worried however that the plan set out may not work based on furlough being extended. I hope this is not the case and it has enough lengthy gaps between each stage to prevent it from failing.
