I am feeling a lot more relaxed about the situation. Having had the vaccine and now seeing the effect around me where the numbers have dropped I do feel less threatend or worried about my and my families health. I am looking forward to the summer and the opening up of things and on the whole just feel optimistic. I also feel lucky as the sliver lining to this whole pandemic was a job change for me which has worked out to my benefit. I am happy that my child is going back to school soon and that he has come through this year without sever negative mental health problems and got through the school year as best he could. Life is hopefully returning to some sort of normality and that makes me feel a whole lot less anxious and worried.
