The corona situation makes me feel slightly anxious. I am worried that there may be another wave and I've already had to shut my business for 8 months in the last year due to the virus. The lockdowns have also made me feel proud of myself. Early on I decided that I would live the best life I could during lockdowns and use the time to evaluate what I want with my life.  There are aspects I will take forward such as living in the moment more and making sure I make time for me after this is over which I didn't do much before.   I appreciate things more. I realise how much much I love my business, my family and my friends. It has been an appalling year but I have come through it stronger than I was and I glad I had the opportunity to make the most of this year.
