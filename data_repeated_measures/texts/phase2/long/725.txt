I feel very insecure regarding the coronavirus situation.  I have no faith that the government is acting in the best health interests of the country.  We have been in official lockdown but this hasn’t been enforced so most are ignoring the rules.  The vaccination programme is powering ahead but with only one shot, and the second not within the manufacturers’ timeframes, who knows what the final efficacy will be. The economy is being taken care of as best as possible but the fine line between this and the health of the population is biased towards the economy.  I am fearful that once kids go back to school next week infections will once again rise.
