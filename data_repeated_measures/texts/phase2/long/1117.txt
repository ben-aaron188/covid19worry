Would like it to be over. To stop social distancing so we can start to resume normal life so we can see family and friends again. After having covid and loosing my mother in law to covid I'm thankful there is jow a vaccine. I feel like things could have been done quicker and restrictions put in place quicker than they actually were. Ready for my children to resume normal school life they have missed out on so much and I'm worried about how behind they actually are with their school work and whether this will have any future detrimental effects on thier mental health in the future
