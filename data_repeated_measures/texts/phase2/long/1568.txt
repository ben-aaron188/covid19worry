I am feeling positive that things are improving and lockdown measures are easing at the end of this month and beyond, but I feel anxious about how long it will last and whether further lockdown measures will have to be reintroduced in the future, especially over the winter again. I worry that figures will start to go back up and we won't be able to meet with friends and family again. I just want to be able to see my friends and family, even if it has to be outside in gardens etc. I do think things need to start getting back to normal, we can't stay locked inside and put all of our lives on hold for much longer. We will have to learn to live with covid like we do with the flu.
