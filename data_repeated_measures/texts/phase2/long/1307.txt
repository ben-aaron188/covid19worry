I feel anxious about the current situation, as I am worried for the health of myself and the health of my family. I am also stressed about keeping up with my university work online, as it feels more hectic than when it was in person. I am starting to feel more hopeful, as more people are getting vaccinated in the United Kingdom, however it will be a long time until I can get vaccinated myself. I am also worried that there might be another lockdown when things start to re-open in the coming months, if the current spread gets worse or a new strain begins to spread.
