Feel very scared of the virus...not out of the woods yet...frightened that people think the vax will solve all the problems and take advantage causing the virus to continue spreading...still need to be very careful for a long time yet. Stopped me from socialising but wont be in a hurry to do it. Will continue to wear a mask for a long time yet and distance myself from other people. Not interested in any interaction with people outside my family...will continue to shop online and wont be eating/drinking out at all.
