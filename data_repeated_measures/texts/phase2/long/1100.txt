I feel sad that it has been going on so long and for the loss of life but hopeful for the future now we are coming out of lockdown. I feel anxious about catching it and passing it on to my grandmother who I live with. I also really want to get back to my normal life but am aware of the dangers. I feel anger about how the government have handled this and wish we were more proactive (like Australia). Overall I'm hopeful for the future with the knowledge we now have of the virus and the precautions we can now take.
