As an at-risk person, it's nerve-wracking to feel so vulnerable whenever I step outside. Having to be so cautious about the disease has given me so much stress recently that it's difficult to remain optimistic.

However, I'm feeling like there might be a light at the end of the tunnel now. I'm scheduled to receive a vaccine soon and the idea of being able to go to the shops without worrying for my health and wellbeing is incredibly soothing.

I worry for my family too. We're fairly susceptible to illness, and the thought of anyone I care about catching it terrifies me.

My relationship with my partner has had to be put on hold as well. We talk often, but actually seeing eachother is impossible, and it's saddening that I can't comfort them during all this.
