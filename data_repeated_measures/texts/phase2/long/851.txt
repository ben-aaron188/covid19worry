I am disgusted at the government for the way they have handled it. We are only now making people do hotel quarantine, and they are not vaccinating people fast enough. They waste vaccines every day if people don't turn up instead of just offering them out with some kind of appropriate system. They should be giving money to everyone in the country irregardless of if they work or not - there should be a set sum to help people with bills. We are sat at home all day every day, and bills have increased exponentially.
