I feel hopeful for light at the end of this long tunnel bug also anxious about 'vaccination passports' and what not having the vaccination means for the future. I'm worried I will be forced to have something. I actually don't know how I stand on the vaccine yet but being forced to have it worries me and makes me want it less. At the same time, I'm fed up of our situation, going in and out of lockdown, not being able to see family and being stuck in a very lonely situation. I'm also a big frustrated at our government. I know they are doing their best but more and more infotmation keeps coming out. About giving 'friends' contracts, failed contracts and now they can't give our NHS staff the oayrise they deserve?! The one they deserved before even all their started?! It's absolutely ridiculous and makes me so angry.
