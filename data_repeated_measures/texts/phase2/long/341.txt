Positive about change but not convinced that it will all relax in time. I have no faith in the government and I'm so sad at some many people have died. I want to see my family and am fed up of being in the house. Looking forward to summer and better weather and going on holidays. I am nervous about returning to offices and my work making me travel to London. I don't want to socialise, I'm still scared of catching the virus and want people to be wearing masks and stay distanced to make me feel safe. I'm nervous about people I love getting the virus
