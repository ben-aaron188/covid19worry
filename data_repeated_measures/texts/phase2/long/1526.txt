I am still feeling very anxious and worried about the coronaviris situation as I am classed as vulnerable and my partner works in a primary school so is unable to socially distance himself away from the children, although I have had the first dose of vaccine which makes me feel a bit more reassured about the situation. 

More so feeling angry with the government and the way they have handled the coronavirus outbreak. Just seems to be a complete shambles when compared with other countries and the way they have handled it.
