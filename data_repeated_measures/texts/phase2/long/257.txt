I’m happy to be spending more time at home with my family. I don’t feel under time pressure as I’m not wasting two hours a day commuting as I’m working from home. I’m relaxed as there’ more time to do things I enjoy like gardening. I can exercise every day after work and then make dinner without rushing. I love hanging out with my kids and my husband and my dog. There’s time to chat and have fun together. We get chance to do things together like going on walks and chatting. I choose who to hang out with outside of my family and go for a walk to chat with a friend once a week rather than once a month like it used to be. I can see colleagues in meetings and get the job done together. It allows me to be more focused on my work and get stuff done.
