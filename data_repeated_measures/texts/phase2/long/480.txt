At the moment, the end of this pandemic is not in sight. I am not sure that the vaccination will take away the risks by that degree and am anxious about the effect this all will have on my children, their education and the experiences that they will have to miss in these crucial years. In the past year, there has hardly been much face-to-face teaching and absolutely no extra-curricular activities or clubs. It would be alright if we knew when this will be over but it seems this way of life is the new normal which would be bearable for me but I feel sad for the children.
