It’s annoying having to hear about it all the time, it’s always in the news and everyone keeps talking about it. I don’t really care about it either, I just wish everyone would stop overreacting about it. It’s not a big deal - more people die from the flu or cancer each year but everyone seems to have forgotten about that, yet they are still a very prevalent issue. I want everything to go back to normal and put all this nonsense behind us. I would much rather we focus on other issues too, such as illnesses that kill more people.
