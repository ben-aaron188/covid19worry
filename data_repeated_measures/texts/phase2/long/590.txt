Still very anxious and apprehensive as I’ve worked all the way throughout with the public. There is hope with the vaccines and cases and deaths coming down so that’s something to be encouraged about. But slightly worried to hear about different variants. So cautious but optimistic about everything. I know I’m a way off getting my vaccine but hopeful to get it and will the second I receive my invite. Vaccines are the only way out of this mess and the fact we’re doing well in this country gives everyone reason to be hopeful.
