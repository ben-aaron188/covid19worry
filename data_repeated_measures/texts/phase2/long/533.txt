I'm feeling positive that the vaccine seems to be making a big difference to the number of infections, and that it doesn't look to be too long now before we can really start to relax the current restrictions.  This last year has been hard, although I do feel it has had some benefits, such as the opportunity to work from home more often even once the offices have reopened.  I've also been able to take up a home exercise routine using youtube videos, which has helped me to become fitter and start losing weight - I'm planning to keep going with this in the future.
