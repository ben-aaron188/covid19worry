I am worried but hopeful about the rollout of the vaccine. I am still anxious about being around others and in public places. I have been working from home and self -employed and scraping by but after some big expenses last month I have to get a job for the time being. I am scared about what that might mean for my health as I am vulnerable.

 I am angry at the government for using the crisis to enrich their friends and families and I am angry that they are pitting the UK population against the NHS wrt the 1% ""pay rise."" All these things are linked. We could have had any government to see us through this crisis but we had the most incompetent and corrupt one imaginable. I feel shame and anger.
