I am very sad tht I have lost the closest person to me in the world because of this horrendous disease. 
I am very sad due to this reason but also very hopeful for the rest of my friends and family and society. I really hope we are near the end of this awful time.
I want everything to go back to normal because the anxiety that I feel that I could potentially loose someone else I love to the virus scares me every day and I just pray we get back to some sort of reality very soon.
I hope everyone listens to the rules and stays away from their loved ones to save life’s because if they don’t we will not see the light at the end of the tunnel.
