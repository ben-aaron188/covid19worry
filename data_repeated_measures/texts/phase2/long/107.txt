I AM WORRIED ABOUT PUTTING MY SELF INTO DANGER. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY LETTING THEIR GUARDS DOWN. I HOPE IT WILL STILL BE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO WEAR A MASK. I WILL BE NERVOUS IF ANYBODY GETS NEAR TO ME, AND DREAD CROWDED PLACES. I HOPE PUBS AND RESTAURANTS WILL STILL HAVE PERSPEX SHIELDS, AND TABLE SERVICE. I AM GLAD, AND RELIEVED WE HAD LOCKDOWN RULES, AND FEEL SAFE WITH THE RULES. THE RULES DID HAVE TO BE PRECISE, BECAUSE EG. THE CHURCH I BELONGED TO, EXPECTED US TO ATTEND, EXPECTING GOD ALONE TO PROTECT US, IF WE PRAYED HARD ENOUGH. WHICH I KNOW IS DANGEROUS THINKING.
