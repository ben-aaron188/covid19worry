It seems to getting better and we are at the end of it. The numbers are going down and the children soon return to school. I am really pleased with the speed of the vaccine rollout so again it seems like the government have taken control. In the summer I hope to travel again, we have booked mexico. As long as we are not aske to restrict our movements when we are on holiday and we are not asked to self isolate in a hotel room at a very high cost then this will be a major positive. I hope to experience a summer with very few restrictions.
