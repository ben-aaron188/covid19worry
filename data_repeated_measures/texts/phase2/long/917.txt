The long lockdown with no end in sight is hampering my mood. The isolationa and lack of social activities make every day the same. A boring hamster wheel.
I am glad that I still have a job, many lost theirs and they were hit hard. Economically I'm in a better place, but the mental health is deteriorating.
I hope that with vaccine passports we'll be able to get out, albeit with limitations.
I still manage to get in touch with friend and family but it's awful.
I am sad because working from home makes every hour the same. I work and live in the same place, there's no solution of continuity.
