I feel disgusted and angry at the way people are disregarding rules. I have experienced 2 losses in January this year, 1 of which was caused by covid. And both didnt get the send off they deserved due to rules, which could of been eased earlier if people did as they are told and cared for one another. It is all getting better, but I am scared that with dates of easing now in place, people will just stop putting in effort and make these dates be prolonged even more.
I have also been financially impacted, and mentally as being at home on my own whilst furloughed has meant i feel very lonely
