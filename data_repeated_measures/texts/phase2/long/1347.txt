I feel stressed about the whole situation, as a teacher it has been a lot about adaptability and resilience with online learning and everything changing constantly. I don't fear for myself but I do slightly for my older, more susceptible relatives. I am angry at how the situation has been handled and the false hope that has come with it. I feel like it should all be over at this point, much like other countries and had it be handled effectively with a focus on people rather than money and the economy.
