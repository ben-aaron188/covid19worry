I feel very little. I have turned my feelings off to deal with this entire situation and lack of social stimulation. I feel passive and remote. I have been on a rollercoaster of emotions the last year. I know don't feel much and avoid getting high or low feelings as there is nowhere to put them. I'm more stable feeling very little.
 Just easier to keep your head down and get on with everything as there is no other option. I don't want to feel anything as it's easier to feel nothing. I really don't have anything else to say or any other way to explain it. Thanks
