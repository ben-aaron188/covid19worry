I am hopeful that the vaccine will help to bring back normality, but I am also worried that sending children back to school next week will start another wave of the virus, as numbers of infected people are still quite high.
I hope that I can see my family again soon. It has been a tough year for us all. Five loved ones have died, and a new baby has been born. We have not been able to either mourn the loses or celebrate the new baby. It has been a time of mixed emotions for us all and we need to know that we can come together some time soon to support each other.
