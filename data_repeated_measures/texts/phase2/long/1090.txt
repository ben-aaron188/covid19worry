Depressed at the woeful response by the government and the number of people who have died. Frustrated by the wasted money on contracts for the mates of those in government on PPE. Worried about the chance of catching COVID still. Disappointed by the seeming inadequacy of the track and trace system. It feels like we still need to now more about how COVID is transmitted - who are the people who are still catching it in a lockdown, how does it still spread? 
The only surprise is the seeming success of the vaccination programme but I'm waiting for something to go wrong with that.
