I feel afraid as I am high risk. I feel abandoned by the government, who made it clear that the loss of disabled lives would be an acceptable price to pay for economic recovery - and they then failed to even attain economic recovery. The statistics relating to the disproportionate rate of disabled people among the dead are not being reported. The UN previously investigated and found the UK to have breached human rights in treatment of the disabled. I am scared, and I am full of disgust towards the government and towards the individuals who refuse to take the vaccine or even wear a mask because ""only a tiny % of people die from covid!"".
