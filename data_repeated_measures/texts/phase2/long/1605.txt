I feel like the government is not doing what it could to keep the situation under control. As such, my anxiety is increasing as I don't know what I might or might not be able to do soon, as I'm about to enter the workforce. I also am thinking of moving soon to benefit my mental health, but there is a lot of uncertainty about the availability of jobs and help no matter where I am.
Also, with the lockdowns becoming almost regular by this point I'm feeling very lonely and it seems like there is no end in sight with new variants appearing.
