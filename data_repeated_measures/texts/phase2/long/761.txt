I feel so frustrsted, I want things to go back to normal. Majority of the population have now been vaccinated so I really do not understand why we are still living like this. I hate living in this way it makes me so sad. I think the government need to be honest as I feel we are all being strung along. I have noticed my own mental health has deteriorated during this pandemic. My work has also suffered. Everything has been hit hard. It is difficult at the moment to imagine that we will ever be normal. It really affects me with other people in terms of personal space.
