I feel very tired and exhausted from the current covid-19 situation as it has been going on for a year now. I still feel very anxious about the uncertainty of the future and the months and year to come. I also feel angry that the government has not done more to support the people that need it during the pandemic. I also feel a strong longing and desire to finally do normal things again like seeing/visiting friends and family once covid-19 restrictions are lifted. I want to return to normality without having the constant worry of covid.
