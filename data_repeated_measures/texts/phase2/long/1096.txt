Im on constant edge about corona. Ever changing sityation is taking its toll on my mental well being. Now Monday with schools reopening my fear is it is too soon. What if this triggers another lockdown can people cope with another lockdown. U fear that too many jobs are lost and we will be payingbthe debt back for my lifetime.  I'm scared my family will get the virus becayse they are wanting to get normality bak. Will they rush qnd fall foul to not following safety precaution. My head is full of worry  i want to seey friends qnd family but i want to be safe and i don't know how that can be.
