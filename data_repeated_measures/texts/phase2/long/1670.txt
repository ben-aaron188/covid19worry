I am optimistic about the covid situation because of the vaccine drive in the UK. Although I hope that we can continue the vaccination programme without experiences the supply issues that may other countries are facing. For the first time in a year we seem to have a way out of the cycle of lockdowns but we will still bear the responsibility of maintaining low infection rates after lockdown is eased. Compared to how the situation was handled initially, the UK seems to be in  much better position than many countries across Europe.
