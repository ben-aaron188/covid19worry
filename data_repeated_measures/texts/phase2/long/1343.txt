I don’t feel worried about catching coronavirus or anyone around me catching it anymore. I’m now more annoyed at how it has gone on for so long and how the government have dealt with it. I feel fed up of being stuck indoors and not having any motivation to do anything, I’m sick of wearing masks, I’m sick of other people not wearing masks. I don’t believe anyone is exempt, as it doesn’t hinder anything as it’s constantly plastered all over yet they’re allowing those who can’t be bothered a get out card making the rest of us sheep to carry on regardless, proving it is a joke. It’s been a complete farce from the start and the only thing I can say about how I feel is just fed up. Completely fed up.
