Desire to get some normality back. Desperate to see family and friends and travel without restrictions and get on with life. Fearful at the thought of spending even longer in lockdown. Frustration at the lack of freedom and plans being constantly cancelled and the governments constant u turns. Sad that I haven't seen a lot of family or friends since the beginning of lockdown, I've now lost a family member due to something non-covid related and only got to see them once during the pandemic. Angry that we can't accompany close family members to hospital to offer support.
