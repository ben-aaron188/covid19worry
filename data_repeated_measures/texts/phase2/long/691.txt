I am feeling a bit frustrated and sad about the amount of time that the virus seems to be lingering and affecting our lives.  I do feel the the end is in site though and that within a couple of months we will back to some sort of normal life.  Its the simple things like having a haircut and being able to go shopping which seem to be so tantalisingly near but still seem so far away. Just really hoping that there are no further setbacks and that we will not be disappointed by having further restrictions.
