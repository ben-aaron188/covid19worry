I feel hopeful about the current covid situation.  With the rapid roll out of the vaccine we should be able to return to normality.  Im am just conscious of the economic repercussions and what they will mean for the future of the economy. There will be long lasting effect particularly withing the employ ability department where there will be mass unemployment, particularly within the hospitality sector. 
What I am most looking forward to is that people will be safe socialising and finally being able to see friends and family that have been missed.
