I feel frustrated at the handling. I’m frustrated at the thought of vaccine certificate and not being able to enter the world post covid without one. It feels like the government are trying to force themselves into everything we deal with. I feel frustrated at how long we as a country have been in lockdown, everything seems to be dragging and on many occasions I’m not sure I believe what is going on with the give. I feel quite excited at the prospect on coming out of lockdown. I am a bit apprehensive about how busy everywhere will be straight after we come out after lockdown.
