I am a bit fed up of the rules but have been following them exactly as I am supposed to. I'm a bit fed up seeing lots of others who don't bother following the rules at all. Work has been very demanding over this past year as I am a key worker & we haven't got much thanks for risking our health, so not too happy about that either. I am happy the government have been rolling out the vaccine pretty well, it's the one thing they have seemed to do right through this. I feel that we are getting close to things opening up again and I am very happy to be getting the kids back to school, that will be a massive relief.
