I feel frustrated that it is still affecting our lives so strongly. I am also frustrated that the government bumped my health condition (asthma) from Group 6 in the vaccines. I'm sad my family couldn't visit the country this year and anxious because I don't know when I'll be able to see them again. I am also bored of working from home as I feel very isolated from my colleagues and not part of the team. I'm looking forward to restrictions lifting a little so I can see my friends but nervous that it will cause cases to rise again.
