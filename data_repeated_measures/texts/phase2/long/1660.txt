With the vaccine programme I am starting to feel more hopeful that things will get better by the summer. I fear I will still be anxious around people for some time to come. I am fed up of lockdown and want to be able to return to some sort of normal. Thankfully with the return of schools my children will get to see their friends again. I am also hopeful of travel being allowed by the summer to permit a holiday for me and my family which we all feel we desperately need. Fingers crossed we are allowed to go abroad
