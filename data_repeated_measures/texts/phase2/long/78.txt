I'm feeling very optimistic, although still a little disappointed that many people still aren't taking it seriously in the area I live.  Since March 2020 I've seen many carrying on as normal. On saying that, as a family, we have followed all guidelines and restrictions in an attempt to protect ourselves and do our bit. I don't think the restrictions have been enforced enough and the ignorance of done people is shocking.  
I'm looking forward to returning to normality, although I'm not in any rush. But...I can honestly say that there are some people I won't be in a hurry to see and won't hide my feelings to how badly they've acted towards the pandemic.
