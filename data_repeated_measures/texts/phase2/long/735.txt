I think right now the corona situation has made me somewhat at ease due to alot of people getting the injection however I still have my worries for if the injection has bad side effects to family and friends and other people as I cant bare to see anyone suffer. 
Having the lockdown eased somewhat and children going back to school has definetly helped me to be less scared of the future and I really hope it is worth it too! 
The feeling I have now is much more relaxed and I know now that things are going back to normality which is something I really cannot wait for.
