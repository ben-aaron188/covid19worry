I am frustrated that, despite a successful vaccine rollout in the UK with subsequent positive effects on death and hospitalisation rates, we are still in lockdown and will have some form of restrictions until late June at the earliest. I am frustrated that the government said lockdown would be eased once the vulnerable have been vaccinated - which they now have - yet nothing has changed and we still need to 'protect the NHS' from a virus than now poses a small threat to the service and will therefore not overwhelm it in any capacity.
