I’m just absolutely desperate for things to start reopening - I want to see my friends and family so much. Also would like to be vaccinated and angry with anti vaxxers, not so worried about the actual virus anymore, more just fed up with all the restrictions and rules and wanting to get back to some normality, I’m dreaming of nights out and pub crawls and garden parties and all the fun stuff I used to do. I’m also angry with the government for how they’ve handled it and are responsible for so many deaths
