I feel that once again, we are rushing back to ‘normal’ too soon. I am anxious for my child who has to go on public transport to get to their education setting. I despair of some people and their anti-science stance. I am depressed and would like to go out. I have a holiday booked in the UK but am not confident that it will be safe to go. If people behaved themselves and the government gave responsible advice and guidance, we might be living like New Zealanders now. Life is slipping by, my children are getting older and passing milestones. Relations with one of my parents is damaged because of them putting us at risk.
