I feel more at ease. The prime minister Boris Johnson has stated that lockdown will end by the 21st of June. This has slightly improved my mood about the virus as I have closure about the lockdown. I don’t fear the virus as much as I used to as everything is starting to die out such as cases but there is a bit of fear in me that there is a possibility that the virus could mutate and be more dangerous this could result in more cases and more deaths which in theory would put us in a another lockdown and would be an endless cycle. But at the moment I’m feeling quite happy and well.
