I feel angry at the way members of the public donâ€™t take the situation seriously, i see the protests and vigils and I am sad and angry at their selfishness. While hospital admissions are down which is giving me hope and I have been lucky enough to receive my first vaccination which gives a lot of relief.However the situation growing in Europe is worrying and I am worried that the government will allow foreign travel before it is fully safe to do so and new variants will be introduced and more restrictions will be introduced. I am also concerned about the about of government debt and how the repayment of that will affect my pay going forwards.
