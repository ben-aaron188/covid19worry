I am very nervous about everything starting to open up again and people starting to go back to work and school. It feels more positive now that the vaccine is being rolled out but it is still scary. I hope that people continue to follow the rules and be sensible so that the cases stay low and don't start to go up when restrictions are eased. I will be staying in until I have had both doses of the vaccine. It feels like a lot of people might act irresponsible when restrictions start to be eased and that makes me anxious.
