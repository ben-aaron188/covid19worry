At the moment, I feel sad at not being able to see my family or friends . I have not seen any family since January 2020, and have not seen some friends for even longer.

I feel anxious about coming out of lockdown as people seem to forget that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic and it seems as though people are forgetting to social distance etc. I worry that as restrictions are relaxed, people will think that things are back to normal and they can live their lives as they did pre-pandemic and do whatever they want, such as gathering in large crowds, forgetting to wash their hands regularly etc, particularly as the vaccination programme is rolled out.
