Just waiting til shops and pubs are open, I don't want to get the vaccine as I feel I don't need it but I will take it as I want to travel and go to pubs, restaurants and gigs again and don't trust this government to stop companies from insisting on proof of vaccine, they screwed the nurses and doctors with their pay rise and they will screw the rest of us too. Unfortuantely I don't think people are taking it seripusly enough, I was just out to 3 shops and all of them were packed with some people not caring about masks or social distancing and acting like things were normal again
