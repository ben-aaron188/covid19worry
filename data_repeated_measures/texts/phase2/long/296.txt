Whenever i think things will get better, business can be reopen, there are always something make me feel depressed. Too much mixed messages out there, locally and internationally. People should stick together and make things back to normal again. However, I think its a bit too early for students back to school when there are still 10K new cases a day...I really wish the number will not rise again because of that. It is not easy to bring the new cases down from 60K a day to 10K, the government should really be very careful about this as I think it is the main reason why the number was so high before. In fact instead of school, they should let non essential business to open first with a very very strict measure.
