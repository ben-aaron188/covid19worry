I am very annoyed with the government for doing so little to protect us.  Even the vaccination programme which could have been a positive was turned negative by using it as an experimental tool and moving the goal posts for some after they had had their first vaccination.  I'm fed up of the restrictions, but see that they are necessary generally.  I do think it should have been a stronger lockdown so it could have been shorter - too many going to work.  Schools are going back too early with no real measures in place to stop spread of aerosol.  I feel anxious because I am still waiting for my jab and my son is back at school with hundreds of kids from Monday.  He will be on public transport too.  If they had waited till the end of the month it would have made a big difference to me.
