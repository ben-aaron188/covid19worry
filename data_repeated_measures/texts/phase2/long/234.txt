Im afraid that the virus will find its way into my home. My other half is extremely high risk and we have been isolated since 2020 to protect him.
I am angry at people who donâ€™t follow the rules and could result in wasting our sacrifice.
I am tired as a result of stressing.
I feel completely cut off from the world and like i could probably benefit from medical help. My anxiety has never been this bad. I get a migraine everytime I have to leave the house.
I am only leaving for unavoidable reasons and would not leave at all if there was any way to do this.
