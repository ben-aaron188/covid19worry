The corona situation originally made my lose my job, however 6 months ago I found a new job. With the new lockdown in December I have again lost my job. I feel very anxious about my personal future, however with many people taking vaccinations hopefully coronavirus will be gone for good. Me and my family have lived through lockdown stuck in our home and occasionally going grocery shopping. I am very worried about our mental health as things are becoming very boring and stressful due to my parents work online having no proper breaks or social time.
