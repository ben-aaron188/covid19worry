I am hopeful that life will almost return to normal soon. I am looking forward to seeing friends and family for the first time in ages. I am fearful that I could still catch covid-19 as I am not a priority for receiving the vaccine. I feel that the government handled the covid-19 pandemic poorly with not bringing in restrictions quickly enough last year. It does make me feel anxious at work as I have to deal with people who refuse to social distance or obey guidelines and the same people could pass on COVID-19.
