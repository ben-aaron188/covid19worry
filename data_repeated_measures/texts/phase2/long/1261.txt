I feel like the worst is behind us and hopefully i am right. That makes me feel hopeful about what is to come but and the same time anxious about what is to come.
Going back to normal at this point almost seems like changing again since the current state of things has become almost normal.  
Almost, the shock was greater on the start of the pandemic than at the end still i believe.
I feel a little hesitant in moving forward but i believe it has to do more with my current situation than the pandemic.
