I am concerned about contracting Corona virus when out and about - for example on the school run, when buying fuel, popping to the shops etc.

I am wearing mask everywhere I go and using anti-bac gel.

I want the vaccine as soon as possible.

My wife is scrared that if I contract corona virus that I will die because of my age, sex and BMI.

I'm a bit tired of lockdown and I am looking forward to restrictions being lifted, however I will still be taking precautions when out and about and doubt that we will be going to pubs or restaurants for a while, we will mostly be doing outdoor activities.
