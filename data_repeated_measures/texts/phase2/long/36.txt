I am feeling hopeful about the vaccine rollout going well but anxious about the return of schools, and hopefully it won't be like the September surge all over again with all of the mixing, but it seems like adequate measures have been put in place to prevent a repeat of what happened previously. Might even get a holiday in this year which'll be good, but happy to stay in the UK this year if it's considerably safer. Nice to be able to get family booked in for vaccines too. Just annoying that it's still going on, especially coming up to the 1 year anniversary of the pandemic, but the end is (hopefully) in sight.
