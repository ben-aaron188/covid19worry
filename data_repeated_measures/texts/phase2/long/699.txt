I feel angry that we have been deprived of so much for something that was not our fault. People are so afraid of dying of something that has a very high survival rate that they have forgotten what it means to truly live and are all too happy to give up their freedom and liberty. I feel worried that our government is mismanaged the  situation and is going to eventually force us to have a vaccine that I fear has not been fully tested and despite all this the lockdowns will continue and people will lose livelihoods.
