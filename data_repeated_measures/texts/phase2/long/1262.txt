Very stressful with university deadlines coming up and work not being the same, everything being online for education has proven to be a struggle. Difficulty with everyone being at home and slacking so difficult to get in touch with tutors for work or asking for help is brushed aside often. Also being out of work for so long has been tough, very low income compared to usual and the struggle of getting by, mainly frustration that a year later we are still in the same position. Anxiety has definetely changed over the year, never use to feel it and now its frequent when attending online lectures and semiaes or leaving the house
