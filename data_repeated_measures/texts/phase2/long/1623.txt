Frustrated that it has gone on so long.
Sad that I havenâ€™t seen family and friends for ages, it has impacted me socially, I have found it very hard. 
Anxious about places opening up and social distancing measures being removed and cases rising again. 
Excited to be able to go out and try to return to normal again though. 
I feel sorry for all the businesses affected, I have been fairly lucky with how my jobs have turned out. 
Upset about the loved ones everyone has lost to the virus. 
Proud of how we have all coped though. 
There is light at the end of the tunnel all be it daunting in some aspects.
