I have no real feelings towards the COVID 19 situation, it is what it is. I feel it is unlikely to effect me if I were to contract it. The only mild annoyance is the lockdown restrictions but as they will be lifted soon I am fairly relaxed about them. I am comfortable that my friends and family will be unaffected by the virus. I feel that too much is focused on the virus currently and that especially given the vaccination rollout that life will soon go back to normal for the vast majority of people
