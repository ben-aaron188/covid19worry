I feel quite relaxed about the situation.  I tested positive for covid in January when there was an outbreak where I work.  I work in a social care setting and the outbreak spread very quickly. Luckily I work with children and not the elderly so none of the residents were seriously unwell.  I was quite unwell and had to take nearly a month off work.  The number of infections nationally is now dropping considerably and i'm feeling optimistic about everything returning to near normal in the future.
