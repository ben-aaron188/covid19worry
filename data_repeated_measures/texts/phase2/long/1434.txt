12 March 2021. I suspected a year ago that this would still be the major part of everyone's life now. In terms of positives now, the UK's vaccination programme is exceptional. Having had the first Oxford jab myself and taken a vulnerable person for theirs I am endlessly impressed by the cheeriness and astonishing efforts of the staff and volunteers at the vaccination centres. I am appalled in equal measure with the casual arrogance and treachery of the Government in terms of the Track and Trace debacle. The vaccination programme and the pace at which that is taking place allows for a little optimism despite somehow new strains of this terrible virus emerging while apparently the UK is in lockdown and not allowing new strains into the country. I am massively fearful however of the relaxation of lockdown before the entire UK population is fully vaccinated. Opening the schools again will result in additional deaths. Further the determination to follow a 'road map ' that the virus is unable to read is foolish, stupid. We have come so far and we risk it all by impatience. In terms of the economy, it is a false economy to jump the gun. I as am impatient as the next person to see my family, spend time with friends, go for a casual coffee and heavens, the idea of foreign travel but that to me is a long way away. My birthday is 24 this month, the last one was 'celebrated' on the first day of lockdown, this is personal, I loath the damn virus but I respect it and we all need to, otherwise you may be asking me these same questions this time next year and with all due respect, lets hope we are all far too busy living life by then! Stay safe, the automatic close to messages from both loved ones and strangers, lets hope we can sign off with 'best wishes' again soon, but carefully.
