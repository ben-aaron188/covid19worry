I really feel sad that this isn’t control and we soon are out of lockdown it gives me anxiety to go shopping for items and scared I will catch COVID I feel if this was control in a good manner we would not be in this situation some times am depressed in the house I can not see my family  and scared for my parents whom are not well and feel that the country has let us down  with many people who do not care and mix a lot and it’s going to get out of controlled I couldn’t see my daughter who had a major surgery and felt really sad and scared for her
