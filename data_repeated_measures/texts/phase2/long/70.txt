I am fearful for my children and grandchildren . I feel i am shielding but the children are back at school . I do not believe the vaccine is going to get us out off lock down any time soon and there will be another spike in the virus. More people are going to die because of this and the government should have acted sooner and closed all borders to foreign travel and travellers . Only good and medical supplies should be allowed across borders. I fear that this virus will last a very very long time.
