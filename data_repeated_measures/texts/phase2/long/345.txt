I feel the corona virus situation is coming to an end and it has been so long since things were normal. I canâ€™t wait for things to begin opening. It has been draining living with coronavirus and although it will never be fully gone I am looking forward to returning to some sort of normality and my children having some sort of normality in life. Corona has changed so much over the last year and it has been so full of uncertainty. I have been scared of catching it and passing it onto my family and especially scared when I was pregnant that I would get it and pass it on to my unborn child
