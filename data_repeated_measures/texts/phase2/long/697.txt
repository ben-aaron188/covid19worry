Overall I don't feel too bad about the situation now.  I'm slightly concerned about the virus still spreading around, due to people not following the rules and that behaviour is still annoying me but I'm not stressing about things.  The new variants are worrying but I think they will quickly get under control.  There is always the niggling thought that other people or lack of government planning will set us back. However, I'm much more relaxed about it than before now that there are vaccines.  I'm feeling more optimistic that will be back to normal sooner than expected
