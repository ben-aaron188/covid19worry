I feel that it is never ending, and that our government floundered so much at the beginning, it feels like it will go on forever. I am glad that vaccines have now been approved and are being dispensed. But again, if they run out or it transpires that they're ineffective, again where does that leave the country. It is frustrating and frightening. So many lives have been lost, time wasted, money wasted it's ridiculous to think that the government keep getting away with the horrendous way that this has been handled.
