I think we have gone from high fear and little cases to low fear but high cases. luckily I have not been personally affected so I do not have many strong personal emotions however my heart does go out to all those affected. even if they say death toll is down to 60 people a day, that is still 60 families everyday dealing with the loss of a loved one sooner than they should.
i think the government are doing what they can at the moment but should've handled it better at the start. I think they should delay the opening of  gyms and non-essential shops to try and reduce the spread since we still have thousands of cases a day.
