I feel really truly sick of the pandemic. If there was any novelty it has long worn off. Im meant to be experiencing university life and am getting nothing but sub par lectureswhich I end up leaving. I've got no motivation and have lost all faith in it being over any time soon. I miss seeing my friends and family and I hate going on walks, nothing has a purpose while there is an overarching virus. I want to be able to enjoy my hobbies, get a job, take part in lectures and socialise with other, not least to stop worrying about everyone around me getting poorly
