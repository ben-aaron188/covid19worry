I am more concerned about other countries who have a less effective vaccination program than the UK. I've been vaccinated, as has my wife and our main anxiety issue is our children, who will be the last to be vaccinated. We are relatively lucky in the UK because we have a good vaccination program and have gone the right way about it. Hopefully, if (and when) the third wave hits the rest of the EU, the UK will largely be insulated against large outbreaks. The only people left will be the fools who refuse to get vaccinated and these people will pose the largest health risk to us all. They will be the ones who will help perpetuate the disease and will not contribute to eradicating it.
