I can describe how I feel with 3 words. Scared. Anxious and Hopeful 
I am scared because there are new variants of the virus. Anxious about catching the virus and how vulnerable my I and my family members are and also Hopeful as there are promising vaccines available now to at least give us a fighting chance.
I am nervous about Potential Side effects of the vaccine as very little is know about them.
The government says its sage but where are they pulling their data from. I wonder. I worry about the long term psychological effect the lockdown will have on myself, my kids and the nation as a whole and I look forward to be able to travel again and hug my family
