I feel that the coronavirus situation is becoming better and better as the vaccine programme continues to make progress. Both cases and deaths are declining so hopefully the coronavirus will become under control. I am optimistic that the latter half of 2021 will see society have more freedoms with less restrictions in place. I am not scared of contracting coronavirus as I only make essential trips when necessary and keep to all coronavirus guidelines. My only fear about it is if any of my older relatives contract coronavirus, as it may put their life in danger.
