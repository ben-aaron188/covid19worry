I am feeling a great deal of anger and frustration towards the Tory government regarding how the coronavirus situation has been handled in this country. Our government has always taken far too long to respond to it which has meant that far more people have died unnecessarily. Not enough has been done to protect the most vulnerable. It makes me particularly angry that vulnerable people have had their lives sacrificed and I currently don't feel that things will pan out positively for the rest of the year. The additional kick in the teeth is that the government aren't giving medical staff the pay rise that deserve considering the risks that they have taken over the past year.
