I'm worried about catching COVID and the long term effects it could have. I'm glad that we've started a vaccination program but I think it'll be a long time before things are truly 'normal' again. I'm worried about lockdown ending and the infection rate going back up, I'd like to just stay at home indefinitely. I wish people would stop being selfish and just stay at home to minimise the spread. I'm angry at the government for how poorly they've handled the situation, and wish that they'd looked at how well other countries were doing and followed their lead.
