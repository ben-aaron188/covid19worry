I feel hopeful for the future. I feel the vaccine rollout is going well and canâ€™t wait to be vaccinated . I am hopeful that we can see a way out of the pandemic. It will be lovely to see family and friends and return to work and return to some form of normality. I feel the NHS had been wonderful and deserve lots of praise and reward. It is heartbreaking that many NHS and health professionals have lost their lives or been very ill with Covid. I do worry about the economic problems that the country now faces though and worry for many people who have lost their jobs. It has been a very worrying time for many people.
