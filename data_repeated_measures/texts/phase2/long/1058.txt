IM VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT CORONA FOR MY OWN HEALTH AND MY FAMILY. ALSO, I HAVE A RELATIVE IN HOSPITAL AND WE CANT SEE HIM. I WISH THIS VIRUS WOULD GO AWAY.IM SCARED OF THE FUTURE AND HOW LIFE HAS CHANGED.THERE IS A DETRIMENTAL AFFECT ON MY MENTAL HEALTH AND I HAVE NO OPTIMISM FOR LIFE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.I DONT KNOW HOW WE CAN GET BACK TO NORMAL OR IF THERE WILL EVER BE A NORMAL AGAIN LIKE WE USED TO THINK OF IT.I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE AFRAID TO GO GO OUT AND MINGLE WIYH PEOPLE BUT THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I FEEL AND ITS GETTING WORSE WITH EVERY PASSING DAY.
