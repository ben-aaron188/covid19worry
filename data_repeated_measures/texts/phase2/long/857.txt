I feel much more relaxed about it due to the vaccination programme going well and reaching good target numbers lately. I still adhere to social distancing and find mask wearing and lockdown very depressing, but there's a light in the tunnel and this keeps me going most of the days! I look forward to getting my vaccine. I think I might have normal-ish summer holiday if I get both doses of the vaccine. Hope levels are much higher than last year. I'm still scared of corona and anxious about getting infected, and I dread going back to the office before being vaccinated.
