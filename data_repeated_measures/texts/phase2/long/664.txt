Frustrated that I am going back into work in a school with no vaccine and mixing with lots of children when I can't see my parents indoors. Tired of not travelling far and seeing others break the rules. Hope that there is a route out of lockdown and that we can see our families more in the summer and enjoy a holiday as our household. Worry about the rates rising as the lockdown in eased and having to postpone events again. Worry that my daughter who is now 4 will remember this part of her life and look back feeling that she missed out on part of her childhood, not seeing family or friends at Christmas, not being able to have a birthday party.
