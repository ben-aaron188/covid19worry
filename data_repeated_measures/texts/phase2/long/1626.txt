I feel the entire situation has been mishandled by the government and if it had been treated seriously from the start we wouldn’t have lost as many lives and our society could have already returned back to normal. I also feel that whilst the vaccine is helping those more vulnerable be less at risk, people are still not recognising how dangerous and threatening the situation we’re  currently in is. Additionally, I feel that certain groups in society, such as university students, are not being taken care of or even acknowledged. Students must follow vague guidelines designed for students in primary and secondary schools, and are either stuck at home paying for accommodation they’re not living in, or stuck in accommodation away from their families.
