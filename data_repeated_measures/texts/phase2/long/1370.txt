I feel hopeful. The number of new cases and deaths is dropping steadily and the roadmap from the government is promising. I hope to see my family again soon as I miss them dearly. Iâ€™m still a little sad at times due to the increased isolation and lack of team spirit at work, but this is improving. I look forward to things returning to normality gradually as the year progresses, and really hope people use their common sense. We need to keep pushing on through the tough times, it will be worth it.
