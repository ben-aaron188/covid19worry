With the vaccine rollout I feel very optimistic about the future in terms of going to university and travelling. I do feel sad sometimes at the times missed as a young person. I also feel angry at the government for the avoidable deaths if the situation was handled better. I feel a strong desire for new experiences and spending time with my friends and being around lots of people being able to socialise. I really miss it. I do feel slightly relaxed as
there is no obligation at the moment to go out, drink ect and I feel a lot more refreshed in the mornings now and seek better
