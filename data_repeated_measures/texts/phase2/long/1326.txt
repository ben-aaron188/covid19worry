I am very worried that things are going to be opened way to quickly and way too soon and having had my father due from covid 2 months ago I donâ€™t want other families to have to go through the same grief process. People are thinking that the virus is finished and are already starting to break the guidelines and the children going back to school will only spread the virus again and as not enough people are vaccinated it will cause sadly further deaths. We should wait as much as possible before opening to preserve lives. Borders should be fully closed to prevent more variants coming into the country and there should be no exemptions to the guidelines at all and any people not complying should suffer the highest penalties.
