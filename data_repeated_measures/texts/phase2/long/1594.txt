Starting to feel more settled with the situation, getting use to living with it but also looking forward to an ease in lockdown measures. 

Starting to look forward to the future although nervous what that will look like and trying to get back into normal society ways. 

Worked through all lockdown periods so will be nice to have time back and be able to enjoy different things in life. Feel like I go to work and come home, don't get to enjoy things we used to like visiting places etc

Starting to miss family members and friends who we have not been able to see for a while so happy about this although sad that we got to miss out on a few things. Hopefully everyone stays safe and well and healthy
