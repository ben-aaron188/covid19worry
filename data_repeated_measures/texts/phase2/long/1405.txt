How I feel about this situation at the moment is fed up and bored. I am very tired of being locked up, I would like be out of lockdown and for everything to open up. I feel as though these mini lockdown breaks have made it all harder to deal with just one effective lockdown would have been better. I am grateful that we finally have an end date where everything is finally going to go back to normal! Not seeing friend and family has got harder over time. The first lockdown was a novelty and it was fine as we thought it was only going to last a few weeks
