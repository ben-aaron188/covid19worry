I feel very sad at the huge and unnecessary death toll in this country and how other countries are also letting their citizens down too. It's sad to look at the graphs each day and feel like 'oh good only X number of deaths' followed by realisation that that means a bereavement for so many families. It's also unnerving to think of the longterm effect on poorer people and small businesses...it's hard to picture what the new post covid world will look like.
Alongside this I'm feeling positive that the vaccines will have some effect in the coming months. I'm pleased that schools are going back so children at least aren't missing out any more.
