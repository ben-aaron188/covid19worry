I still feel anxious about it as I fear we're not out of the woods yet. A vaccine gives us hope but only on top of other measures. There are still question marks over new variants that make me worry. Life is not going to go back to normal anytime soon, I still feel fearful anytime I go indoors somewhere other than my house, that I am relying on masks to protect me. I can't see that easing soon. I am angry at the government for still not doing enough. The vaccine rollout has been mainly the scientists doing. The government don't care about people's health and just want to get the economy back on track.
