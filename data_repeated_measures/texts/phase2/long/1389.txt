I'm tired and fed up of the situation now. I have tried to follow the lockdown and social distancing measures throughout the pandemic but regularly see people flaunting that they aren't following the precautions and it makes me sad for my daughter. She gets confused on why she is told not to do something, only to see grown ups doing that exact thing. Homeschooling has been hard alongside working from home, and I'm scared that the schools may close again even though they've only just opened up again after so long.
I have had the first covid vaccine and can not wait for the second and for others to have had it too. My mother is also coming to the end of cancer treatment that we only found out about at the end of 2020
