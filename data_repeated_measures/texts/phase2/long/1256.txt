I believe the death toll from Covid-19 in the UK reached 120,000 today, or 140,000 depending on how these things are measured.  Our economy is f***ed, totally, by a government that has flung unimaginable amouts of money at every management consultant in the country, and a few in the USA, that between them haven't actually managed to come up with anything that has performed better than any other country, other than the roll out of the vaccine programme - and that was the NHS's responsibility, not management consultants.   I'm beyond enraged by the sheer scale of the incompetence and I will NEVER be reconciled to our failure.  How anyone can think Johnon's performance is acceptable is beyond understanding.
