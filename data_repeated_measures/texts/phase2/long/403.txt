I feel a lot more relieved now than I did a year before especially with the vaccine and employers allowing staff to work from home. A lot more relaxed since schools open tomorrow so less pressure to home school and so that’s one more load off my mind. It’s been interesting to see how women have borne most of the pressure during this pandemic and now with IWD looming there’s the challenge to change include more women in leadership roles to help make policies that are favourable to all including women.
