At the moment I feel less anxious about the pandemic due to the vaccine being rolled out and the number of deaths per day decreasing significantly. The advances in the vaccines and lateral flow tests have led me to feel less stressed and safer to go out for exercise and for essential journeys to do the weekly shop. In addition, the fact more individuals are choosing to wear masks fills me with a higher level of confidence and makes me feel much safer than before when many people were choosing not to wear them even if they did not suffer from any health issues preventing them from wearing any form of facial covering whether that be a mask and/or a shield.
