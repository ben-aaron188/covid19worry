It feels like their is a small glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. I don’t fully trust everything that’s reported so I’m still a little anxious how likely things are going to return to ‘normal’ before the summer but I feel a lot better knowing my loved ones are starting to get vaccinated. I’m still waiting for mine but it’s a small step in the right direction. I definitely feel upset and frustrated at how long it’s been/ still will be before I get to see my close family. I am a key worker and I occasionally get angry at people I know who are not following the rules even though I have no choice but to continue to come in close contact with other people.
