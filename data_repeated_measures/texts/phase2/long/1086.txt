I am just feeling burnt out and fed up with the whole situation now. We have all been in lockdown for most of the past year, and it has taken a big toll on my mental health, which I’m sure is the same for so many other people as well. I feel that the COVID restrictions should be loosened much sooner than set out in the Boris Johnson “road map”, as positive cases etc are falling every day. I feel we should all be living as close to a normal life as possible by May at the very latest, and also that we shouldn’t have to show any sort of vaccination certificate to access work and services etc, as vaccination is a personal choice and should be confidential to the individual.
