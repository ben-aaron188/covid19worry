I’m tired. So tired. Tired of living and parenting and teaching and working full time from home. Feeling like I’ve liost me and anxious that I won’t know how to get back to normal. Worried about my elderly mum and dad. Feel like I’ve lost the essence of what made me. I want this to be over but I still can’t see the end of it.  Life just seems to have become so small that it all revolves round being in home nearly all the time.  I almost feel institutionalised. Feel like I’m failing at parenting. Failing at work. Failing in my relationship. It’s very hard currently
