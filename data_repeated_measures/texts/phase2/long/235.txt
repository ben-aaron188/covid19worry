Living in the UK, I’m encouraged by the speed at which the vaccines are being administered. Since lockdown 2.0, daily infection rates and deaths have been falling and it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel. The government has released a plan on how we will leave lockdown which will possibly lead to zero restrictions by June. This feels like a remarkable achievement considering the scale of the problem. However, I do worry about the problem on a global scale, especially how vaccines programs will progress in poorer nations. Corona is the world’s problem.
