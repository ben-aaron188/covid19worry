I feel anxious moment that life will soon be returning back to normal. I think it is too soon, and know my peers still do not take this situation seriously. But I also feel sad, for I believe that the current situation has now gone on long enough to really be bringing the worst out in people. I am scared to reintegrate back into society however, and almost secretly wish we would go back into lockdown after this one ends - despite my previous concerns that this would be bad for people and society on the whole.
