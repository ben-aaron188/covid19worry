i am extremely fed up as i am sure everyone is.  The world needs to get moving again.  Mental health is an issue for a lot of people.  I really miss being able to go to a clothes shop etc.  I miss seeing my family, it has been over a year and it is really getting to me now.   I feel the UK government handling has been appalling from beginning to end.  The only thing they have done well is the vaccine and now even that looks like it will be stopping for people my age.  I feel i am getting more and more depressed, my partner is the same.  We just want it all to end now.
