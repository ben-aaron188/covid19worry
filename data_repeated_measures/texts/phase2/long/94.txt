I have enjoyed being at home and spending time with my family so the restrictions havenâ€™t bothered me over the winter. I also feel a lot less anxious now my family have had their vaccinations. But now we are coming into spring I wish I could take my daughter places. I get upset when I realise how little we could do with her last year and I want to make up for it. Also she really misses people which really upsets me. I think it is unfair that we have to wait so long just to go for a walk with another family, it seems really excessive.
