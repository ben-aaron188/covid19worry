I am awfully tired of this situation. This is not to forget about those who have lost their lives/have their lives interrupted by covid-19. But as an individual I am constantly tired of this state of nothingness. As a university student, this state is horrific as I don’t feel like time is real when deadlines are still very much real and demanding. I miss everyday life and genuine social interaction. I feel like when every day life is “back to normal” I still wouldn’t be comfortable with it as I am now not so accustomed with it. Now that we will be allowed to see one person from outside our own house, my friends have tried to make plans however I am mentally not ready for it even though I really want to be out and in their company.
