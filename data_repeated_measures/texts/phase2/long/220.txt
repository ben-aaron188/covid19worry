At this moment I am fed up trying to work and be a mum at the same time, from our home. I am fed up of missing out on key moments with family, who won’t be around forever. I’m
Fed up of putting life on hold. I’m fed up of seeing my kids sad because they don’t understand why they can’t see family, friends, go to places they enjoy. 

I’m sad that people have died, I’m sad that people are still very unwell.  But I want to get life back to normal - I am happy there is a vaccination and appreciate that it is being delivered to older people first.
