I am becoming tired of the mundane and the loneliness the pandemic has caused. I am pessimistic that things will get back to normal any time soon and as I love to travel this will be difficult.
As I am disabled and not able to leave the house often even before covid it is affecting my mental health more. I feel quite trapped in my own home. This becomes very boring and isolating and means I have been unable to do the things that I love. I am concerned about my financial wellbeing as the government makes cuts to benefits that I rely on.
