To be honest, I'm completely fed up with it now, I just want to be able to travel and see my friends and family.  I'm feeling a little less anxious now that my mum (who is high risk) has had her first vaccine but I'll be happier still once she's had her second.  I have enjoyed getting to know my local area better, discovering new running routes and doing some work on my house, but I'm more than ready to get back to normal again now.  Apart from the work aspect.  I'd be quite happy to work half my week from home on a permanent basis.
