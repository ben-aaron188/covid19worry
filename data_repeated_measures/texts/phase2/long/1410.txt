I fell exhausted by the Corona situation. I am glad that vaccines are now being distributed but as a healthy young person I am anxious about the wait time and wondering when i'll be vaccinated. I am also very anxious about returning to work (particularly as this would involve a train journey) and the travel costs and tiredness associated with in person work (though I have been working full-time from home). I also wonder what changes, if any, will be implemented to keep everyone safe (by the government and more locally by my work place). Finally I cannot wait to be allowed to travel once more but also again feeling extremely anxious about being in a tin can in the air.
