I think tired would be the best word. Tired of the lockdown, tired of the deaths, tired of the economic situation, tired of the vaccine politics.  Even with the vaccines i worry think this will be the end. Countries are going to require passports and are going to use coronavirus as stick to beat other countries with. Like the anal swabs from china. It's going to become another tool in the geopolitics playbook. I worry about the long term effects on my young sister, who seems to be developing into NEET even though she still goes to virutal school, she is stressed about going in person again, she doesnt look for a job, etc.
