I feel that the coronavirus situation is beginning to see an improvement in death rates and cases per day. I’m hoping that the lockdowns will end soon, I’ve been very anxious in these troubling times not because of the fear of catching this corona flu virus but the economical and financial strain it has put on me the past twelve months. At this moment I feel frustrated and also anger towards our government for not handling this pandemic properly. Locking down my part of the country for nearly five months now is not the solution.
