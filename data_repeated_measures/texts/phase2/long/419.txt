Neutral on feelings tbh I donâ€™t feel at risk because I have followed the rules strictly. I am confident once vaccinated it will be over soon. I have missed seeing my family and my nieces and nephews. We have moved home since the pandemic so also looking forward to exploring the area. I have more hope for future than sorrow at this moment in time. I think we will end up living with this like we do fly and other diseases. The hardest thing has been the increase in food costs and although I have stayed in full time work my partners wage has dropped and even affording one shop a month is difficult with the price of food. Fruit and veg is cheap but everything else seems to have shot up in price.
