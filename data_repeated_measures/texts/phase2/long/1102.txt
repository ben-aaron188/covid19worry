I feel frustrated that not everyone is taking the guidelines seriously and I feel angry at the government for not properly dealing with the Corona situation when it first started. I don't feel very hopeful about Corona being gone anytime soon and I think it will be here for a while. It's been harder for me to attend college and I've had to drop out due to mental health reasons but it's also been very difficult to find any sort of work. I miss my friends and I haven't been able to see them for a long time because of lockdown regulations but I understand that it's something that must be done.
