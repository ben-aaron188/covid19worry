I feel that now the vaccine has been created and proved to be effective, things might improve very soon. I think the pandemic has opened a lot of doors on where society will move next and exposed vulnerability that need to be addressed. One example of  things improving is remote working. One vulnerability is that many people can be misinformed about situations and don't listen to reason such as people not believing that coronavirus is real.

Ultimately, I feel that while there was a lot of incorrect steps that the government made during this whole ordeal now that the vaccine is done, there may be a new beginning.
