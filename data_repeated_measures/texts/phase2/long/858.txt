I had my first dose of the vaccine this week so I feel optimistic about the future.  Iâ€™m looking forward for the first time instead of being in some sort of suspended animation.  I can start planning for future outings, shopping trips and even holidays but with the understanding that some precautions are still needed, like masks and social distancing.  It looks like the vaccines combined with the lockdown are reducing the number of cases.  I am feeling more positive than I have at any time in the last year.
