I've not been too worried recently. I take all the precuations I can - social distance, mask wearing, hygiene plus trying to remain helathy.  I've also just been informed that I should be able to get a vaccination shortly so I'm currently cautiously optimistic about my own situation. I am, however, extremely agnry about the Government's colossal mishandling of ths situation and their quite frankly carpet bagiing attitude to use the pandemic to give money and contracts to their pals. I;ve never witnessed such a level of outright corruption in a UK government in my life.
