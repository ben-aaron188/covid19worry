I'm fairly relaxed about the Coronavirus situation now. My fiancee has had her first dose of the vaccine, so I'm less concerned about her wellbeing as I have been throughout the last year. Further, my personal finances have seen a sizeable boost, meaning I'm less worried about job security going forward.

I'm slightly anxious about the EU vaccine situation though. From experience travelling in Europe, they do not know how to queue, which I fear will result in them jumping the AstraZeneca vaccine queue and creating tension on the global stage.
