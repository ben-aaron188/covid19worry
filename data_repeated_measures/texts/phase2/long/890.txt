It is better, covid cases are down and  there are less people dying. we have been in lockdown for ages and are coming out of it. we will have normal summer where we can go out and see people and eat out. it is much better now and covid is pretty much going away. i am looking forward to going back to normal and getting out and about so that i can be free. there has been lots of deaths and we are broken as a society with so many flaws and inequalities which covid has highlighted. its time that this changed
