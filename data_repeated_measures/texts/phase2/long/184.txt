I'm anxious for family members and friends as don't want anyone to get sick or worse.  I'm tired of lockdown, especially as I live alone as it's hard sometimes.   I'm trying to remain hopeful that the vacccinations and ongoing lockdown will allow us to return to some kind of normality this year.  I really want to be able to see my friends and family again, and properly so be able to hug them and just spend quality time with them.  
I've been lucky that I've been able to work from home throughout which is good from a safety and financial point of view.  It does however bring it's own challenges, from a technological point of view and having no interaction with  people in a physical sense.  Can be a bit lonely at times
