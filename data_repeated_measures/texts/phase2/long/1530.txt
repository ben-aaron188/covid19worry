I'm fed up with people not sticking to the rules and allowing this to all drag out for longer and longer. My kids will both be reaching their 2nd lockdown birthday in a few weeks (currently aged 1 and 4). My youngest one hasn't had a chance to socialise so who knows how that'll affect her. The opportunity for her to build a bond with the family has all but gone now when she was at a crucial age.
I pretty much hate my neighbours now, they just have anyone come and go as they please and these are the people that 'clap for the NHS' and so on. I think there are a lot of people who I will see in a different light now once this is all over. If someone like me with depression and anxiety can manage to stick to the rules for a year, then what on earth is everyone else's problem. People are dying alone and scared because they aren't allowed their loved ones to be with them as they pass away, while others are just flaunting the rules. Selfish, that's what.
