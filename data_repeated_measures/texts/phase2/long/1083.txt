I recently received my covid-19 vaccine so my anxiety has reduced somewhat about contracting covid however i know that this is still possible. my dad has terminal cancer and i am a front line worker so i still have a lot of anxiety around passing something to my dad. all our immediate family received the vaccine and are looking forward to our second dose to further boost our immune systems. i am cautious about coming out of lockdown as not everybody adheres to restrictions and social distancing and it  feels early to be opening everything back up again
