I feel that although Coronavorus is still very much apparent in our society, the affects it has had on peoples mental health is much worse. Members of my family have not stepped foot out their doors since last March as they are terrified. I am working and have been throughout the pandemic in an emergency childcare hub which has been tough as guidelines have been consistently changing meaning. I have severe asthma and I'm due to get my covid vaccine next week. I am looking forward to life returning to normal. I have attended family members funerals where only 20 people could attend a very impersonal service and covid has taken away any form of proper grieving as it has forced the family to be alone during a time where you need family and support from others.
