I am at the stage where I am very concerned about what is happening. As we are told we are coming out of the lockdown in a controlled manner we start to get news of new variants and that vaccines aren't the panacea that we were being led to believe. I am both angry and worried that this is being manipulated to change the way we live so that we never get back to the normal of pre pandemic.  I have no fear of the virus, I have had my first dose of the vaccine and now I just want my life back. I still do not understand why it seems that anyone who dies now seems to be another covid statistic, it is as though we are in a competition to have the most covid deaths. I hear of more and more people who are protesting that covid is put on death certificates when the deceased entered hospital for another reason (terminal) but contracted the virus in hospital or had a positive test after they had been in hospital a few days. None of this makes any sense. I am not into many of the conspiracy theories but some of what is happening just makes you think that something is not right.
