Corona doesn't bother me but I have been thinking a lot about the vaccine. I have my letter to get the jab because of my ms but really don't want it for a couple of years as I want to see if there are any problems that come up with it. I am feeling apprehensive about it as I'm concerned that I will be bullied into having it if establishments stop people entering that don't have a 'vaccine passport'. I'm not bothered about holidays abroad etc but I don't want to get stopped from me or my family being able to do every day things or for holidaying in the United Kingdom. I thinks if this is brought in it would be very unfair and foes against everything.
