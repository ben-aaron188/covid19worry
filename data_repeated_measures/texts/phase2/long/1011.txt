On the one hand I feel we are close to returning to some sort of normality but I worry that something unexpected will happen such as a new strain tearing through the country. I'm fed up with lockdown but I also worry about the financial situation that may follow. We talk about returning to normal but I don't know what normal is going to be. After having been under lockdown for so long part of me is reluctant to rejoin the normal world. I worry that everything is going to be very expensive and the we are not going to be able to afford any luxuries in the future such as a foreign holiday and  that we will simply be working to survive.
