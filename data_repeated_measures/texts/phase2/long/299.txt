I feel more relaxed now because with the introduction of the vaccines life does look like it may be about to start getting back to normal again. There is definitely light at the end of the tunnel and I can sense that the majority of people feel that way too. It's been a hard few months but we are nearly there. I think we have done well and I feel thankful that I have come through it unharmed, I am ready to get on with living life to the full again. I feel that as a country we have worked well together.
