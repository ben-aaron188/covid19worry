I still feel anxious about it. Normal life feels a long way off and I would not be comfortable with it until I have been vaccinated and the rates are lower. I think it is irresponsible to allow people to travel abroad or even plan it until we have a better idea of how things are. Other countries are way behind our vaccination progress. Allowing people abroad could jeopardise the progress we have made. I feel safer with with current restrictions in place. My day to day life has not changed so much because 9f the restrictions and I feel relaxed in my bubble.
