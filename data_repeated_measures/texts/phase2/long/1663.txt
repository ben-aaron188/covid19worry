I am extremely fed up with the COVID-19 situation. I feel like if we had been stricter to begin with, we could be in a completely different position now instead of a third national lockdown. Compared to the last survey I took I’m a lot less worried about the virus as most of my vulnerable loved ones have been administered the vaccine. I’m hopeful that everyone will stick the rules set out by the government so Boris Johnson’s plan can be followed and none of the dates will be delayed. Currently, I'm looking forward to everything being allowed to re-open so I can continue to live my final year as a teenager in the way I envisaged. There are so many opportunities that have been missed and memories that I haven't been able to make so I'm trying to remain positive and plan the best summer yet.
