I am not angry that Corina Virus exists, I am angry at the UK governments response. The lack of action and then cracking down too late is getting tiresome. They have no given clear guidelines or laws to police, therefore it is difficult to enforce anything. I also have no trust in them when they say that things will be 'normal' in June 2021 after the Christmas mayhem that they caused by shutting the country down after promising we could all go home. For me, this leads to feelings of anger and sadness whenever I see or hear the news, which is particularly distressing, as I am already prone to anxiety and depression.
