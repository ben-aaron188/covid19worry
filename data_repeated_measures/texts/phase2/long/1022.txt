I think the word tired best describes it. I am tired of lockdown, tired of working at home, tired of being alone. I am a bit more hopeful though, given the vaccination programme and the current rate of slow opening and easing of lockdown. The fact it is much slower has in a way made me feel more hopeful and have more faith in the governments actions compared to last year. I get very frustrated easily and i think it is because almost everything feels out of your control at the minute. I've noticed that I get upset a lot more over little things and they feel like an even bigger deal.
