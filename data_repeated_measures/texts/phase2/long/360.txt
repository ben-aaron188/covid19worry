Mixed. I don't think there is a right way to handle the current situation.  Yes, distance and wear masks at every opportunity ams avoid gatherings.  But at the same time the government can't pay its way out and support everything without this having a huge knock effect for years to come.

And its terrible that we have to accept there will habe to be a certain amount of expected deaths annually... But there does, we need to keep going, kids in school, people at work.

So, its both worrisome and challenging.  I hate risk but risk seems inevitable.
