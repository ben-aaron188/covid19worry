The pandemic at the moment feels like the new norm. It seems to be becoming desensitised which saddens me when itâ€™s still very much current. I am hopeful for the future now that vaccines have started to roll out but still cautious and practising social distanced measures and wearing masks. I feel worried about my family and friends and am looking forward to them all being vaccinated. The death rates seem to be decreasing and we are at the last push, but I am very tired of it and feel mentally drained.
