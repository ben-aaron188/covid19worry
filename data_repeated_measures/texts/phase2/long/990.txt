I mainly feel frustrated as there are so many things I want to do but I can’t, I’m wasting what should be the best few years of life (at university ) sitting in bed learning on my laptop and going to work, then for fun going on walks. I am very bored and want to get back to normal, every time I see someone disobeying the rules it annoys me as it is just prolonging lockdown for everyone. I miss my friends and family and I am finding it so hard to be stuck inside and not being able to see who I want and do what I want.
