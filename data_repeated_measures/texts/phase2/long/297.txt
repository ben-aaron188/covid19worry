I feel worried that we will never get away from coronavirus and that life will never be normal again. I really feel ready to have life back again and be able to live properly rather than just surviving, I want to be able to do things with my son as he has basically been shut inside for most of his life so far. I feel angry at the government for their handling of everything related to corona and how they keep changing the goal posts for things getting better and they are messing around with people’s life’s and it’s not fair.
