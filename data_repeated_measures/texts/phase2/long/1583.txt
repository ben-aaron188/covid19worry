I'd kind of just like for it to be over. I don't have any worry about catching the virus myself because I know it won't affect me badly and I don't come into contact with anyone who it would affect badly either. But it's very difficult to stay in a positive mindset when I'm barely allowed to leave the house and I can't see my family and friends. I think I'd be a lot happier if I was able to meet up with some friends, or go to the gym, or do something that doesn't involve just sitting in my room.
