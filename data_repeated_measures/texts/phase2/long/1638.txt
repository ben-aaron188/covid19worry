Hopeful and Optimistic. I am having my second jab tomorrow and looking forward to lockdown being lifted soon. 
It’ll be nice to have some sort of life again with my little girl and have days out
The last year has seemed to go pretty quickly looking back though
Other than that, it’ll be nice to get back to work full time too 
and be able to have childcare again! 
I miss the little things like the beach. It’ll be nice to go for a walk along one again and breathe in the sea air

It also nice to see the daily numbers dropping in my local area
