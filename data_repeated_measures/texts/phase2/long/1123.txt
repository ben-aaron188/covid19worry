i desire for things to be open but i accept it will come eventually. i feel anxious about the upcoming months but fairly relaxed at the moment. i do feel a bit sad as its harder to see family and freinds but i have managed to see people close to me. i am slightly fearful about how everything will work once things 'go back to normal'. i do feel quite happy as i am at university and i am still able to socialise and have some sort of routine. i feel sad about family members lost or for those who have lost their life or corona has affected severely.
