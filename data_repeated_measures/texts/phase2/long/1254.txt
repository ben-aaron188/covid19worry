I'm significantly more relaxed about the situation due to the rollout of the vaccine and the reduction of daily deaths from Corona in the United Kingdom. I think we're almost out of the lockdown and quarantine period as a result of that, and i'm generally relaxed about the situation now. If everything goes well in the UK, we should be out of lockdown by June and people's lives can go back to how it was pre-pandemic. This'll help people's mental state as well as repair the economical hardships it has caused on people and the state.
