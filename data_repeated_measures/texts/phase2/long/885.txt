I am feeling a little less anxious since my in-laws, mother, brother and myself have all have the first dose of the vaccine. I'm sorry that my husband has not been called to have his yet.  I will feel even less anxious once we have all had our second dose.

I am very sad for all the families living in fear or have lost loved ones due to the virus

I am slowly feeling more positive that things may be a little more normal later this year.

I still feel anxious if I'm around a large group of people (the school run even though we all socially distance) and using public transport.
