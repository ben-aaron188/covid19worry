I’m feeling worried because I’m not sure how I feel about going back to school on Monday and I haven’t had a vaccine yet. I want to be able to give my mum a hug and can’t yet because it’s not safe. I don’t want to catch covid and I don’t want my family to be infected with it either. I want the world to go back to normal and to be able to go into a shop without risk. I want to be able to visit family and friends and to get my hair cut and my nails done. 
I think my daughter has missed out on a lot by not being able to go to play centres and ballet classes etc. I hope the projected route out of lockdown is able to go smoothly.
