I feel robbed of life for over a year - my children have suffered greatly and I worry about the experiences they have missed.  My terminally ill father has missed out greatly - from the lack of support available, services cut, unable to see friends, enjoying holidays and just generally everything that would have made his life a little easier at this difficult time. 

I feel we could have recovered from this a lot quicker as a country as we are an island and could have stopped travel right from the beginning that makes me angry.
