I have just had my first dose of the vaccine two weeks ago, and my outlook is more of hope now than it was a couple of weeks ago without the vaccine. I can see better days ahead, but I am also disgusted at the amount of people that have died when they didn't need to over how the uk dealt with the situation as a whole. I am anxious for my children and myself on how the world is going to be afterwards and if things will be able to be the same again. I feel that not everyone is going to take the vaccine which means that covid will still be able to spread around those people and mutate in the way we don't want it to, and the vaccine won't be enough it is a scary time still for everyone.
