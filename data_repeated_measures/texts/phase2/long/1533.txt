It’s just the unknown and not knowing when it’s all going to end that’s the worst bit.
The impact on children has been quite severe and I think they need a return to normal ASAP.
I don’t think they need any catch up on education but on time to socialise and experiences.
In general I think everyone is now reaching covid fatigue, the winter at home in lockdown seems to have sapped all energy and motivation, for anything.
I am looking forward to the better weather and hopefully the lightening on restrictions
