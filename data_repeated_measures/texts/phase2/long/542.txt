More hopeful towards the future as there are now many vaccines that appear to be effective against the virus. The number of infections is falling, as well as people admitted to the hospital. Also, the government have set dates for the reopening of society which gives people something to look forward to. It seems like after so long we are finally getting on top of the virus as more people get vaccinated although these people may still get infected the symptoms appear to much less severe. Although the virus is still serious, I'm still hopeful about the future and feel like the end is in sight.
