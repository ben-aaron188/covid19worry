I am still as worried about the situation as I was a year ago. Now the added thing is the Covid vaccine and people having that. I'm not going to get mine until June time probably but even with this I'm not letting my guard down. I'm still missing family that I haven't seen since last year. And I'm still worried about me or my partner getting ill, but hopefully, it will all be fine. The anxiety over it and being around people though is still high and I think will be for some time to come. I will still continue to wear my mask and I don't like being around people not wearing one, if I could avoid people altogether then I really would.
