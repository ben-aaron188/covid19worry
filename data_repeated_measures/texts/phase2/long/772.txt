I am much more comfortable and relaxed about the corona situation right now. Cases are down & the vaccine rollout has been successful and at pace. My children go back to school the week after next which will give us all more normality. They are excited about seeing their friends again. This in turn will lift pressure at hind which will be a relief for us all. My disabled daughter will receive her vaccine very shortly, as will I as her carer. This too is a big relief.  My older relatives each have received one dose of the vaccine while my grandmother now has had 2 doses. This has brought much needed good news and has lifted their spirits and given them hope for the coming months.
