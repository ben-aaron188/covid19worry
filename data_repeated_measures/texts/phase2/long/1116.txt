Corona is very scary although things are easing off still scared of potential relapse in virus causing future lockdowns and causing depression.
Life has been totally turned around and frozen due to everything going on and I do not see an end to this way of life we are all going to have to rethink how we go about day to day business and be mindful of who we come into contact with especially family members who are vulnerable to prevent them being put at risk.
Although vaccines are about it is nerving to know that other variants could be perking about and potential re infect family members.
