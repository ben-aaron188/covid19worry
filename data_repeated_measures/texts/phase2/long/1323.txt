i feel very worried , if a family member was to catch the virus i would be upset .it is a scary time .life is at a standstill at the moment life is not normal and everything is worrying. i worry about the effect it is having longterm on childrens education and social activities. the elderely have been isolated from familiy members for such a long time in care homes and there own homes. it is going to affect a lot of peoples mental health in the long term       the economy is going to take a long time to recover maybe a lifetime of recovery
