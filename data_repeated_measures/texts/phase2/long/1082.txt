I have had my first vaccination so feel a bit safer from the virus, but I am worried that people are not taking the lockdown seriously as it's not the same as the first lockdown when everyone stayed at home. I think it will all come back again as people are going out and mixing. I dont want to ever go to a pub or restaurant again as this will always be around and could come back at any time. The virus will change as it has been already, and I think this fear will be here forever now. I am worried about some people saying that covid doesn't exist, and its all made up by the government. They are going to get us all infected.
