Whilst the situation is improving with vaccinations happening there is still uncertainty over my job which is making me anxious. 
When out exercising some other people are making me angry when they don’t respect the 2 metre rule, this is very rude. I have been lucky that no one close to me have had the virus but this has been hard won with us not seeing each other. I am hopeful that things will improve but uncertain. I’m very concerned about the consequences of how the government will recoup the money they have had to pay out as feel that it will once again be the poorest who will suffer the most.
