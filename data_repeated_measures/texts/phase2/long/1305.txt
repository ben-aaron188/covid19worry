I feel sadness at this time. We are a shielding family and I feel sad and missing my friends and family. My teenagers are missing out on so much of their teenage years.

It also angers me that people keep breaking the rules when we have stuck to every rule over the past 12 months. I am left feeling angry and sad at this situation that not all people are doing what we are doing.

I feel anxious that my youngest child is returning to school this coming week. Whilst I know she needs to return to school I am anxious as shielding is still in place until the end of March.
