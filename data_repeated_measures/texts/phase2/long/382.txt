I just feel so resigned. Schools go back next week after iver 2 months off and hopefully locjdoen ended by June but it all seems pointless now. I've lost touch with all my family and friends and relationships will not be the same now. I feel lonely but almost like I don't want this to change as got so used to being at home. I think people will just be wary if being around people for a long time. I feel anger at people who have flouted rules when a lot of us have followed the rules. I feel upset that people will continue to be worried even after it has all calmed doen a lot....it just feels like the world has changed.
