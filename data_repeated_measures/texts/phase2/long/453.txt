I feel that the UK government have been completely ineffectual at tackling the COVID-19 situation. I feel that Tory ministers and officials have acted in their own economic interests rather than in the interests of public health, and I feel that science has been supressed in this process. I feel that COVID-19 has exacerbated existing social inequalities in the UK, and that the wilful spread of the disease through the population from early 2020 to now is nothing less than social murder. I feel that moving into autumn 2021, the country will find itself back in a similar COVID-19 situation as in the previous year because of government corruption and incompetence.
