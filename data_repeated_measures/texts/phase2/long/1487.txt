I don’t want to relax. I feel happier now my husband is vaccinated. Strangely my anxiety and concern is about my family rather than myself. I feel angered about others relaxed approach. I’ve been angered by seeing neighbours out and about with covid. I’m excited about some sort of normality returning but equally this makes me thoroughly nervous. I think the government have had a hideous situation to deal with and no matter what they’ve done there’s always going to be people who disagree. I trust their choices even when I possibly don’t agree. I am nervous for the future. I feel it will be a very different place. I don’t see life as we knew it returning. I think this will permanently change society. In some ways for the better.
