It makes me sad about people not following rules and anxious about being around people. In supermarkets there is little social distancing which makes it hard to shop safely. I am worried about catching covid and passing it on to my family. My children go back to school tomorrow and though I am happy for them to be back I am also worried for them. I do not feel good about not having a holiday this year again but I cannot put my family through the risk of catching covid from all the people who do not feel the same as I do.
