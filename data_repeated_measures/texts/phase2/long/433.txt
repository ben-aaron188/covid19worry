I feel that as a nation we need our lives to get back to normal now and we need to start living again. We have lost people but also saved people from not having flu this year. The impact on mental health now is very concerning and we are wasting time that we should have with our families and friends. The government have done the best they can and people need to stop judging. We are all in this together and i feel that has been forgotten. We aren't able to move on unless the media let us. As a single full time working mum i need my life to start again and am fed up of being lonely and tired.
