I don't really feel affected by it anymore. The vaccine developments have made me quite relaxed about the situation, so I rarely think about it anymore. While my life is still different, for example I can't see my friends and I have online classes, I feel that I have gotten used to it. I have adapted to life in the pandemic so I feel that it may be difficult adjusting to life post-pandemic. However, the roadmap set out in the UK has given me an idea of how society and the economy will begin to adjust, so I feel somewhat prepared to make changes.
