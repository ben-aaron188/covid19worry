It's weird. I have a better understanding of the Corona pandemic but I'm still anxious as I haven't had the vaccine yet. Maybe that'll change when I do receive the vaccine. I'm less anxious if I know I'm doing everything I can and I'm staying at home safe, but I feel like there's always still a risk which is why there's still a level of anxiety.
I have some levels of anger towards people who aren't following the rules and are making it harder for everyone else. It's really frustrating seeing everyone prat around and doing what they want, when there are still many people who are at high risk.
