Angry, frustrated and exhausted. The fact that it’s a year later and we’re STILL in the same situation is appalling. 120k lives have been needlessly lost and the economy in ruins thanks to the utter incompetence of the UK Government and they should all be forced to resign. 

I’m also feeling lonely because I haven’t seen my friends and family in such a long time. 

Perhaps slightly hopeful because the vaccine rollout is happening, but not at all confident that the day of the 21st June being ‘over’ will be adhered to
