I'm glad that the vulnerable people are now getting vaccinated and things can soon go back to normal. I'm worried about the government putting us into lockdown again after the summer and the impact it will have on small businesses once again.  I strongly feel that once the people at risk of serious illness have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated and enough time has passed to where the vaccination is effective that the country should completely reopen and corona safety guidelines should be optional.
