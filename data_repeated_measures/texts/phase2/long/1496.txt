I feel the nation has not followed the rules closely enough and the Government did not impose stricter control much quicker, leading us to having been in this restricted living situation for a year now. I am sick and tired of being trapped indoors and I am angry at the general public for not practicing more caution. I have gone through an entire pregnancy in these circumstances and am due soon but am slightly anxious that my partner won't be able to come to hospital if he tests positive. I feel overlooked as a new first time mum to be and devalued, like I don't matter, as I have had to attend all my appointments alone. In fact I feel fathers to be don't matter because they have missed the experience of seeing their babies and being involved in pregnancies. I have started to feel a bit of hope but this is mixed in with apprehension about this June 21st date when we can come out of restriction totally at the earliest. If I'm being honest with myself I think this will be pushed back but I don't want to think like this because it makes me feel sad.
