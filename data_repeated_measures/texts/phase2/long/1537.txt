I'm happy that in the UK we finally seem to have an end in sight. I'm extremely happy and feel very positive about the vacine roll out. I'm angry that our government did'nt do more, and sooner to help bring us through this and that so muc money was wasted early on through cronyism and nepotism. 
I'm feeling happy that I might get a winter holiday and that very few people I know have become ill.
I'm sad that so many lives have been needlessly lost. 

That more or less sums it up. A great big mix of emotions. Mostly anger though, at our incompetent government.
