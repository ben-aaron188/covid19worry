I am not concerned at present, I have had my first jab, more concerned aboutthe people that are avoiding the jabs. I am enjoying working from home and more anxious aout having to go back to the work place just because of covid but I am finding a better work life balance now because of covid, it has actually done me a favour! I worry for some of my friends thae have been caught up with financial loss because of Covid and those that have been furloughed or lost their jobs because of it. I dont believe that life will go back to what it was and things will become harder for people, the financial loss for them and the UK as a country could effect what happens in the future and a new rich/poor boundary could be created because of it.  I am a little cross with myself because I could have been alot better of but because of the boredom I ended up still spending just as much, if not more, on shopping and gamling and my friends were not there to discourage me. My son has not been able to start his adult life after college closing and he is not suffering anxiety because of it, this is hindering him from looking for a job in an already difficulty and flooded environment.
