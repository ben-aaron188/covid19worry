I want things to return to normal. My children miss their friends and family, my 3 year old doesn’t understand that she cannot see her grandparents or cousins. My 9 year old is not happy with home schooling and he needs to return to proper education. I haven’t been to work for a year and I miss my routine. My mental health is beginning to suffer. We live in a beautiful area but have been to the same park everyday for the last god knows how long. I feel I have wasted so much time of my life that I will not get back.

However, at the same time I understand people have lost their lives and the lives of their loved ones. 

I do believe we should have had more enforcement during our lockdowns. It is unfair how many of us have obeyed the rules whist others have continued to mix with others
