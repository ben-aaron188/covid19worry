I am anxious abot whether we will go back to normal as the road map plans out. I am worried they will have to change the plan if numbers spike again. 
I am also excited about the prospect of normality! I just had a baby and so am desperate to see family, attend groups and be able to meet others. This lockdown in particular has made me feel very isolated - previously I was working full time and am now on maternity leave and have to stay home for most of the time. I hope the vaccine programme helps us out f this mess but also feel anger towards the government that they have helped add to so many deaths.
