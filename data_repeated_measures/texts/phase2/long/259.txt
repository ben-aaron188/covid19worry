I feel like the situation has been going on far too long now and that nothing significant has been done to stop it. We really should have properly locked down for a month or so rather than this useless stuff for over a year. I feel that we have been let down as a country by those in power and there is still more to come in the form of additional taxes which is unfair going forward especially on those who have had to work through in ""essential"" jobs. There is no real end goal here and I feel that it will continue past the dates currently set out for relaxation with continued number of strains appearing  week by week
