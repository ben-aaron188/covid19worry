I feel very relaxed about the current Corona situation. I'm in good health, am not a person at risk from Corona and have no immediate financial worries. I'm currently on furlough and enjoy having free time to spend with myself and others. I'm happy for the lockdown roadmap that the government have outlined to run it's course until normality can resume once again in the future.
I anticipate we will have to live with COVID-19 as a way of life in the future. I'm pleased that there is now COVID-19 vaccines to help the most vulnerable.
