I feel like the worst of the situation has passed, and that things are going to improve soon. Things are already improving, and soon I will be able to see my friends again, and socialise. I’m so excited for the schools to be opening again this week, and for shops etc to be opening again soon. I feel like the plan the government have laid out for lockdown to end, is a positive one, and is giving a lot of people hope. 
The fact that it’s ending soon, has really lifted my spirits and made the desire to see friends and family again, really strong. I am so excited to go to the beach, to do loads of fun things this summer. Not long to go now!
