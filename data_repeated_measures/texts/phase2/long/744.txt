I'm just really looking forward to being able to do more stuff. Even the simple things like fish and chips at the seaside. It's boring now, that's all. It's even hard to describe my feelings because every day is the same. I work from home, see the same four walls and do the same things. Making conversations is hard becasus I don't do anything new. I don't even feel depressed or anxious, just bored. Even getting this up to five hundred characters feels like a stretch of my abilities since there is so little sat about the situation. It just feels as though its gone on long enough now, I cannot wait to be vaccinated!
