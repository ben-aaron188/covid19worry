I feel like it is still something to be worried about, however i think now that the majority of vulnerable people in this country have had their vaccines, we should start opening up the country again. I still get anxious when around other people, as even though the number of cases is quite low at the moment it is still a concern, I feel like outdoor activities should start to open up first, then move onto indoor, such as opening shops and cafes etc. I feel like this would be the best approach. Overall I am quite happy how the welsh government have handled it, however the uk government have handled it very poorly.
