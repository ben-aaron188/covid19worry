Its good that we have a vaccine and its being rolled out quickly. I'm concerned about how long before its safe to travel abroad and it looks like the UK government acted too slow to put restrictions into place in airports, i honestly thought it was a forgone conclusion that we'd have put measure in place for international travellers much quickly. I also think its a huge mistake to open bars and restaurants when not everyone has had a chance to have a vaccine. Bars and restaurants should have opened after the entire UK  had been offered the chance for the vaccine.
