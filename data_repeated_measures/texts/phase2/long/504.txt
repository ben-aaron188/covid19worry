It's been a disappointing time and feel we have lost a year of living. It will still take at least another year before hopefully, we get back to some sort of normal life. I feel angry about the way I have been treated by my government over this period. I pay the same taxes as everyone else but they have chosen not to support me and people like me in the same way as other citizens. But I can be thankful that my family and friends have stayed safe over this period. The sooner the world can get the Coronavirus the better it will be for everyone.
