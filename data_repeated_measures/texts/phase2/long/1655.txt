It quite exhausting especially when the corona virus has been so long time. I would want to get back to new normal, where there is no restrictions on socializing with people and going outside for activities. I especially look forward going back to work, because staying at home has been quite difficult. The difficulty is to stay inside and having the same routine everyday, with no chance to explore new things outside. It is bit difficult to continue doing same things over and over again. Even though it has been nice to do your own thing it is difficult to have the meaning on what youâ€™re doing.
