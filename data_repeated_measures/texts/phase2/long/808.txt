I am angry that after over 100000 deaths those responsible for the decisions that led to those deaths are not only escaping justice, but making personal fortunes out of the situation.

I am hopeful that the vaccine rolling out quickly will squash the pandemic but don't trust those intoxicated by greed and power not to mess up yet again.

I am, however, looking forward to getting out and about again as the weather improves. 

I am concerned that a significant proportion of those vaccinated early - baby boomers with disposable cash - will act selfishly and place those younger and poorer than them (upon whom they depend for the service economy) at greater risk.
