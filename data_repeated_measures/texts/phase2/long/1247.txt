The situation seems to be improving but the government handling of the situation is not inspiring confidence.  Lifting the lockdown seems to be a matter of ""how soon can business start making money?"" rather than ""when is the safest time to lift lockdown? ""   We have seen two relaxations of restrictions followed by increasing infections and deaths.   On both occasions, decisions were driven by commercial considerations rather than scientific or medical considerations.   The government always claim to follow the science whilst actually giving priority to economic factors.
