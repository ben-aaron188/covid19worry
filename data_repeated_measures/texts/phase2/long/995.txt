Very disgusted and furious at the way it has been handled, the rules put in place have made covid less manageable and have caused bigger problems to crises we were dealing with before covid became an issue. Other health cases have had their priorities reduced and increasing with more cases and resources needed to treat them. I don't believe we will be back to normal by June, i believe they have given us that date to silence people. i have nothing else to say...........................................................................................
