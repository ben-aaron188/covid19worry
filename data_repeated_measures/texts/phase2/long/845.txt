I feel exasperated. It’s been handled badly and people are getting to the point where they don’t care. The focus is on the economy, holidays and money which I understand but they’re rushing things and not making sure people are abiding by rules. It seems the country should’ve been harsher at the beginning and reopening too much cause the second wave. The rules aren’t clear and don’t cover enough instances. The fear is that more things will be open and people will rush out and we will be back to square one
