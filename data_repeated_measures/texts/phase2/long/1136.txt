I feel that the coronavirus situation is on its way to being some way of under control. I feel like the vaccinations is a fantastic idea to support the easing of lockdown, and will make the older generation feel a lot safer when our and about after having the vaccine. I believe the government should force people to have the vaccine and they shouldn't be allowed in certain places without it. I read about the coronavirus most nights, as I am only 25 years old, I have already been vaccinated and believe it is well worth the risk of having it cos the level of protection that is offers.  Sometimes I think boris Johnson should have brought restrictions on early but that is his choice and now we are suffering an extensive lockdown for this.
