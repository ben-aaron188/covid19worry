Back in September i was made redundant, now I worry about the future for me and my kids as there are very few available job opportunities and to more and more people with much better qualifications than me applying for any job they can in order to make ends meet. I think at the moment i feel like a bit of a failure, i know being made redundant was beyond my control as it was due to a company breakdown due to Covid-19. There is still the feeling in my head that I should be in work again by now but it doesn't seem to matter what I apply for, replies to my application are never given. 
As for my feelings towards C-19 as a whole, i am fed up of lockdowns, tier lists, shop closures and school closures. I have been fully supportive of all the measures taken so far and follow the guidance whenever I can. I find myself getting really annoyed and angry when I see groups of people in the street or walk past a house that is having a party. I honestly blame these people for making this situation drag on as long as it has done. The reason i am so fed up of the measures now is my general feeling towards these people that break the rules, thoughts going around in my head such as ""Why should i follow guidance to protect those that aren't willing to protect their selves and instead put other people at risk."" Well, I will continue to follow the guidance in hope that these people don't completely ruin our efforts. Not for myself or those that won't give the same curtesy but for those that are vulnerable. 

Thank you for the invite to the study.
