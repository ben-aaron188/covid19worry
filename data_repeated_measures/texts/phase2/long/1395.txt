I feel that much of the past year has been wasted.  That government has lined their own pockets and those of their cronies at the expense of the poor, women and children.  Mental health is now at crisis point and they have terrified healthy people into thinking they will die.  There seems to be no cohesive idea on how to get out of this situation and no care taken of the many who have fallen in-between the cracks.  Mainly I am angry at this and bored of the small world I now live in.  I want to be able to do my job (singer) and my child to experience the world properly.
