I’m feeling bored and tired of the pandemic and restrictions. I still feel a little anxious but less so now that the vaccines are being delivered. I’m a lot less worried about clinically vulnerable family and elderly family catching the virus now they are vaccinated.  I’m back on furlough which is fine but overall I am a bit frustrated. I would also like the schools to go back as I’m concerned about the mental health of my kids- this is the number one worry for me. They need to be with their friends and away from the screens much more. I just want my life back!
