I feel like we are close to the end with lockdowns nationally which makes me feel like I have something to look forward too, I do still feel worried about the circumstances in the UK on the cases and deaths daily. However, I do feel happy I have been vaccinated now and just want it to be over. I feel like I have missed many events over the last year such as big celebrations in my family, holidays abroad with my boyfriend and just want normality. I am worried this summer leaving university and the current employment in our country with Covid
