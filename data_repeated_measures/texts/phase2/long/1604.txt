I am concerned that there still are an astonishing number of foolish people thinking that the rules don't apply to them, or that it is okay to bend the rules. It makes me angry to hear about underground raves taking place and having to be broken up by the police. I am hopeful that with the continuing rollout of the vaccine that despite the percentage of the population who couldn't find their behind with a map we will be protected enough from the future spread of Covid19. I feel reassured that my wife has already been vaccinated. On top of that I actually feel flattered that I am classed as too young for the vaccine yet, at 44 it has been a long time since anyone called me young.
