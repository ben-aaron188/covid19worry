Absolutely fed up, sick and tired of lockdown. Bored. Missing out on life. Sick of rules and regulations dictating my life. Want to get back to normal asap, have already broken rules and intend to carry on doing so as I need my and my family's mental health to be ok. Not worried about catching covid, would rather live my life with freedom than this depressing way of living. Overreaction by the government. Lockdown should end now, open shops and businesses asap. Get rid of face masks. Let people live their lives how they want to.
