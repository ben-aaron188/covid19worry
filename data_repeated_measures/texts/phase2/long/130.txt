Let down by the government relating to contracts and lockdown timings but relieved to have the whole family survive having the illness and not be suffering from the effects of long covid. Frustration relating to work but hopeful that there is still an end in sight. Dont believe the true scale of the economic damage done during this period has fully set in and it will develop into a much bigger problem in the coming years and will affect future generations massively as a result. Could be a very bad problem that effects the country for generations
