When will this lockdown end so things can go back to normal. This makes me feel anxious. I would like to enjoy being being able to eat outside. I feel worried for the vunerable people. Especially for those who are weak and old. I worry about the third wave and Iâ€™m scared of news that the third wave could be the most deadliest. I look forward to things going back to normal. Times like this make me appreciate the things we take for granted. I look forward to this coming to an end. I look forward to meeting my family and being able to hug my loved ones.
