At the moment I am really fed up with the lockdown. Not so much for myself but for how it is affecting my (and other people's) children and families. I feel that the young people have been dealt a bit of a raw deal throughout this, made worse by the school closures. I'm quite third of all of the restrictions as we have completely stuck to them, but a year is a long time. Now that the schools are starting to feed back in up in Scotland, and the vaccine programme is being rolled out I feel a wee bit of optimism for the future, but also rather anxious about it all shutting down again. I think if there was another lockdown after this one it will break a lot of people, and I'm not sure how much compliance there would be next time around.
