I feel the entire COVID situation is or has been used for a pretext to take out freedom, and to install draconian measures. 

I do believe there is a virus, I don’t believe in the media narrative at all.  It has destroyed many lives, loss of employment, suicides etc

I do hope we can achieve some semblance of freedom as we cannot give away hard won rights. 

Also believe it’s to wipe out the middle class (business owners) so everyone is dependent on the state.  I do not believe the government cares about their citizens to entirely shut down the economy, do you?
