I am still feeling anxious about the Corona situation but more in terms of economic implications than health implications. I am worried about how the economy will recover and if there will be higher levels of unemployment and higher taxes and how long this will go on for.  Overall I feel that I have made a number of changes in my life in terms of living with Corona such as not travelling, using transport less and working from home etc and Iâ€™m not sure if these will be permanent or not.  I am also more dubious about information that we receive from politicians about Corona.
