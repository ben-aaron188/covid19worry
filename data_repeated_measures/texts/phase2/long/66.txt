I feel that the situation could of been handled much better and then it would of been solved much sooner and things could of got back to some what normal, it has caused too much disruption for things to just go back to normal without some issues.
Being stuck inside is very annoying, yet people still seem to think that it is fine to ignore the government rules and go out and socialise, but this is just causing more of it to spread.
There seems to be no one dealing with the problems and I have yet to see any police give out fines to people, it has made the whole situation very worrying for me.
