I am angered about how the government is behaving under the banner of Covid.

I fear how civilization will be in the future especially with how willing the public is to have its freedoms taken away. I fear a police state and less of a connection between people and instead more of a snitching community.

I fear for those who have taken the vaccines and what negative effects it may have immediately or in the future given how quickly it was rushed out and how the companies that producers them ensured no negative effects would come back on them.
