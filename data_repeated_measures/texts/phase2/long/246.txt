I just want this to over now so I can live a normal life with my family. I wish I can go out for a day out or a little break away from all this without masks etc. I am angry at government for not being clear about all that’s been happening since last year. Basically I am fed up. My daughter a teenager is suffering from depression due to this. Can’t see a doctor. I want to go and see my parents who I haven’t seen them from last 4 years and I want to go and meet my siblings family and nephew nieces but because of lockdown I can’t go anywhere.
