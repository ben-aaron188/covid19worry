I feel that the current situation is disheartening as it feels like all the effort and sacrifices we’ve made over the last year have been redundant as we are in the same position a year on. I feel frustrated at the government’s hesitation to enforce a stricter lockdown much earlier in the year that would’ve perhaps allowed us more freedom now and would have reduced the losses suffered from the end of last summer onward. 
However after having had the first dose of the vaccine, I feel hopeful that we are finally moving forward. I feel more secure this year on a personal level as my wife and I were both made redundant but found new jobs in more secure sectors than hospitality and moved closer to our families so although we are not allowed to see them still, we will be able to when restrictions are lifted to allow outdoor meeting in the local community.
