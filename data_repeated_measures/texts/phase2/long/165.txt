I feel very worried about the virus.Its so easy to catch .There,s people everywhere some not bothered about social distancing.Its worrying that holidays will be starting up again.I feel its way to early for that to happen. Shops etc is fine but not people travelling everywhere.Too risky.Holidays really should be put on hold until this virus is almost gone. Then there is others that dont believe it exists. Schools are opening up which i agree with , but if people dont travel then that will help so much.
