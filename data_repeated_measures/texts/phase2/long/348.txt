I am very angry as people do not follow the rules and are completely ignorant and ignoring the social distancing and not wearing masks and still socialising with many people.  If this continues then the situation will not go away or will take a very long time to go away and get back to normal life.  I have not seen my family for over a year now and it is because of these people who are selfish.  Also I am angry with the non believers who think the virus does not exist and it is a Government conspiracy.
