I'm very anxious. It's been well over a year since I could hug or have any real contact with my young niece and nephews and other family members. Although we now have vaccines, I fear that new mutations will cause a need for further lockdowns. I am not overly concerned about being seriously ill from the virus, I am aged 40 and in good health, but I do worry about suffering from long-Covid as I have chronic fatigue and fear that that could be made worse. I obviously do worry about vulnerable family members too.
