I am sick and tired of the situation. I’m missing friends and family terribly and I can’t wait for this to be over. It’s been such a long year for everyone and I want it to be over and done with. I have two kids and I feel like this year they have missed out on so much. It breaks my heart to think my baby girl has seen everyone in masks for her whole life. She doesn’t recognise facial expressions and she is very scared of people who come up to her. Kids think this is the norm, o know things won’t ever go back to the normal we used to know, it will just be a nee normal for everyone. The anxiety it’s crazy and I’m actually a little bit scared to come out the other side. The vaccine scares me, the nee normal scares me and this whole thing upsets me. I feel so isolated with two young kids and the man I feel guilty for feeling this way as I know a lot of people are a lot worse off then me. Some days I enjoy my bobble and then others I’m surrounded by guilt and fear
