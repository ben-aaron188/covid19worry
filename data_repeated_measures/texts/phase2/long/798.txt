I am feeling hopeful about the news of life returning to the new kind of normal at some point this year. Excited at the prospect of my holidays going ahead in summer. I am relaxed because at the moment i have time to focus on myself. I am proud of the government for getting the vaccines out as fast as the currently are doing. I can't wait to spend time with my grandparents again and enjoy summer. I am feeling a bit anxious about university reopening just because I cant remember what it feels like to be in a classroom setting and I have really struggled with online learning.
