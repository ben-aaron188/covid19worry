The most vulnerable members of my family have all survived and have all had their first dose of vaccine. Therefore, I feel lucky to have come through the last year relatively unscathed. The Corona situation feel like it is almost over but I am still cautious because my relatives still need their second vaccine dose and I haven't had my first dose yet. I do not spend as much time thinking about the Corona situation now as I did last year but I am ashamed of how my country failed to handle the outbreak and how certain MP's have used the situation to enrich themselves and their friends.
