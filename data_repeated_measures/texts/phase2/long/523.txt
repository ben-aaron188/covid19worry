I feel like we are over the worst of this terrible time but I also have fatigue of what has happened. I have had the vaccine and some of my loved ones have too to I have hope, 
I want to go on holiday, I want to see my best friends new house, my other best friends new baby. I want to go to shops. I want to drink in pubs and bars again. 
The news is watched daily in my house. Things are very polarised and the economy is up a creek. Government have succeeded in some ways and failed in another.

I have however lost weight and walk regularly
