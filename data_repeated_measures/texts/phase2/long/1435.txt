I am fed up. I am glad children are back to school for normality and we no longer have to homeschool but I am missing work (still on furlough), missing normal, everyday activities and days out with my family to places like the cinema, restaurants, arcades and ice hockey matches, I feel deflated. I feel angry at those who are clearly flouting the regulations and then brazenly posting about it on social media. I feel like we will keep taking steps backwards and I yearn for life to return to normal again.
