Hopeful that things will improve with time. A bit anxious an concerned for my family and friends. Thankful that God has preserved me this far. Grateful to every frontline and essential worker. Thereâ€™s light at the end of the tunnel. Thankful for the researchers and innovators of vaccines. Sad for all the lives lost in the pandemic. Looking forward to holidays in the future and quality time with friends and family. Anxious about watching the news due to ever increasing death tolls. The coronavirus has united the whole world to fight a common enemy and overcome.
