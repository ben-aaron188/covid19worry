I feel ok and relaxed, life like this feels kind of normal at the moment but we will have a better future i hope. I am looking forward to the future and i am optimistic things will get better. I hope things reopen soon and we can get some normality back. It will be nice to get out of town sometimes as well. 

I think some people are following the rules and some aren't which is causing the pandemic to last longer then it should have. If everyone follows the rules and keeps their distance from one another we would be ok quicker.
