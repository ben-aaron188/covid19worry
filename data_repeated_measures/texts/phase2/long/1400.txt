I'm anxious to recieve my second vaccine as I'm in a shielding group. My children are not returning to school on March 8th, as I feel it is safer for me and them to return after the Easter break. This lockdown has been harder as the weather isn't as good and its harder to spend lots of time outside, this is especially true for my children. We are more prepared this time though and there are elements of the isolation of lockdown that are positive and I'll miss very much when live returns to pre-Covid normal, whenever that may be.
