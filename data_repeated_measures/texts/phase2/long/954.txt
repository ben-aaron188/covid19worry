I am fed up of hearing about. We should be allowed to do what we want to do its our risk. Older people can choose to stay indoors. Younger generation need to be getting out. The vaccine is out there now so we need to move on. 
Schools need to reopen. My childrens education is a shambles. We are not teachers! Live lessons aren't listened to.
There should not be as many school holidays and more learning is required to help the children catch up.
Everyone is fed up. No holidays no social areas open no gyms means people have no motivation, and their mental health will deteriorate.
