i feel much more safer as i have had my jab but the way people behave is terrible no social distancing not everyone wears a mask and thinks nothing of coughing and moans about shops not being open when people are dying , i feel very sad at the selfishness of people and it feels like its not a minority either it feels like about 60% are acting in this way , i feel disapointed that if a even worse virus happens i have no faith in people or the goverment to look after people , the goverment should be way more stricter and say everyone has to wear a face covering or mask and that should apply to children who run everywere up to people
