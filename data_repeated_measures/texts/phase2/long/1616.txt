I am more relaxed now compared to a few months ago, as vaccines have started to be administered throughout my country. I am still worried about the spread of new variants of the virus, but I'm mostly more optimistic about the direction we are heading to eliminate COVID-19. 

At this moment, I'm still worried about loved ones who are vulnerable to the effect of the virus and ones that work for the NHS. I know some acquaintances who have been affected by the virus and people who have died from it, so I have taken extra caution to ensure I can minimise the chances of contracting it and spreading the virus to vulnerable people within my family and within my local community. 

I have taken a very cautious approach to the outbreak and have mostly reduced my hours at work.
