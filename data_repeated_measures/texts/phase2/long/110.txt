I am less worried about the corona situation than I have been in the past. I am reassured by the speed of the vaccine roll out. I am happy that children are now returning to school. The testing that my older children have received has been well organised. Other school implementations, such as mask wearing are working well. I am also pleased that the roadmap out of lockdown seems considered and that there will not be a rush to open things up. I'm concerned only that there may be a backlash if some things are put back.
