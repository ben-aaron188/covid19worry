I feel sad at losing family members from Corona...  I feel anxious as to when will it be over, can we return to a 'normal...  I feel afraid in regards to any more of my family members catching Corona...    Our children have gone back to school, and although we are happy they have gone back, we are afraid they might catch Corona and bring it into our household...  I am looking forward to when it will be over and meeting with friends and family...  I haven't seen my parents in over a year, and we can't wait to go see them...
