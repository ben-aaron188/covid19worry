I am just angry that the coronavirus situation in this country hasn't been handled well at all and we are still dealing with it a year later at this point. I am angry that the government have consistently failed to act quickly enough and not taken the advice of scientists seriously. I am sad that I have lost a year of my life and I haven't seen my friends or family in that time. I am sad that I lost my job and haven't been able to find another one yet now that unemployment amongst people my age has dramatically increased. I donâ€™t feel hopeful anymore.
