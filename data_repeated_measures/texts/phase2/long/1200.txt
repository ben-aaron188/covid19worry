I feel anxious, have no control over the situation, what we can do, who we can see. Having to sacrifice a lot, personal and professional development. Hard to get on with lives at the moment especially when used to geographically being spread about and not in one location. Now having to be based in one location is hard. 
It is difficult to look to the future and to feel happy and positive as we don't know when our freedom will come back again. 
I feel trapped and that I can't get on with life for now.
