I feel like things are getting better and we're at the last hurdle (hopefully). I'm less concerned as I've already had corona but I don't want to become complacent - I'm just really hopeful for life to go back to somewhat normal soon as it's been a year without seeing so many people I care about and staying in has taken its toll, especially since being ill with it. I just want everyone to follow the rules now so that we can all enjoy ourselves, permanently, sooner. It's a lot more promising now with the vaccine roll-out and a couple of members of my family have had the jab so it's a lot more real. I just hope the government don't make any moves too soon, like another eat out to help out situation, and put us in a worse position after this.
