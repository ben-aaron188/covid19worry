I am weary of it all now. I'm tired of the masks, not being able to see people's faces, and being unable to communicate with others/hear others properly because of them. I'm worried about my 22 year old son- he has hardly worked for the past year due to being furloughed and I fear he is becoming depressed. The whole thing has just gone on for too long now, we need to get back to normality but the goalposts keep moving. The uncertainty is dreadful. I don't want the vaccination for religious reasons and also because I don't see the need for it for a healthy person in my age group. I'm worried about the vaccine passport that it will stop me going about my everyday business.
