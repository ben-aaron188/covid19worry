i am feeling very unsure about covid at the moment. I would like the world to get back to normal, but think that the easing of restrictions is coming too soon, and people are going to end up getting us back into the same situation we were in last year by ignoring the advice given. 
I would like to continue working from home, and to have lockdown restrictions eased, but believe we will be back in some state of lockdown by summer. This is why i am feeling anxious as schools have just gone back and this is when we saw infection rates increase last year, and nothing was done quickly enough, leading to lockdown 2
