It has broken relationships for me, it has taken away my good mental health and destroyed local businesses whilst the rich get richer. It has been handled disgustingly strategically and there is no care for anyone involved, no actual care being taken to the most vulnerable as always advertised. It's not going to go away, we have an immune system for a reason. I have seen friends go into depressions, I have seen new mothers struggle, people lose money, houses, inability to buy food, essentials, lose their jobs. I believe that this has been handled in the wrong way in so many ways.
