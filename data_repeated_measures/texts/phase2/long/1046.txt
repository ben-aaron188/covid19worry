It's been literally a year now since I started my new job and was almost immediately put into covid lockdown, I've worked there about half as much time as I should have done by now and it feels strange. I don't feel socially isolated at home though, because I've always communicated with long distance friends over the internet through my teen years so I've not found myself that upset over the lack of socialising. Right now I am enjoying the lack of pressure that comes from being forced into activities just to keep friends at work and I'm a little apprehensive about that coming back soon.
