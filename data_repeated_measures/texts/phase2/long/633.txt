I feel anxious about the future after Covid. But I also feel hopeful at the fact that the vaccines are working better than expected. I think that we will be back to normal before the end of the year. I am optimistic. I feel sad for everyone who has lost someone during the pandemic and have done what I can to protect those around me. I think that it has been a learning curve for everyone and we will come out of this appreciating the little things in life more. People will complain a lot less and appreciate what they have in life more
