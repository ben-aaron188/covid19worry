I am feeling less worried as i have had my vaccination. My parents have also had theirs too. I still get stressed by  the selfish people who don't follow the rules during lockdown. Some people just don't realise how serious it is and don't seem to care about other people. I am looking forward to normal life again but continuing with some of the best parts of lockdown. I also work for the NHS so will be glad when we are over the worst and the job returns to normal again. 500 characters is a lot! This is supposed to be a 6 minute, 50P task!!!
