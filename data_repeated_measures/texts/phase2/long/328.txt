I feel slightly hopeful that things may change and get back to ""normal"" by the end of the year - however the behaviour of some people has jeopardised the trajectory in previous liftings of restrictions.  I'm frustrated by those who can't seem to obey the rules, forgetting that by not following them, they're delaying the lifting of restrictions and getting us caught in a vicious cycle.  Therefore I'm pessimistic that we'll be still be in the same situation at the end of the year even with the vaccination program.  I'm also hopeful that the mismanagement of the entire situation will show people how awful this government is - not that I'm saying anyone else in British politics would have handled it better!
