I’m bored of winter, bored of it being cold and dark, bored of not seeing my friends.  I want the weather to get better and cheer everything up. Otherwise I am fine. Although I also sense that this is going to drag on for ages. I really miss travelling and I’m worried that will never be the same again.  At the moment days just blur into each other because we can’t go anywhere or do anything.  At least the days are getting longer.  January was rubbish and I don’t think anyone enjoyed it. It will be interesting to see what effect the return to school will have on infection rates.
