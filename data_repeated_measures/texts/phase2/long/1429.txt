This country has been a complete mess. Every single moment of this fiasco over the year has been poorly handled. Closing for 3 months before putting kids back into schools. Not cancelling Christmas causing the worst spike of the entire coronavirus timeline. Everything has been mishandled by the government in the UK and I'm sick of it. And yet, they will be voted in again. Because our country is under Stockholm Syndrome. It's disgusting. I'm tired. I just want to be vaccinated and done with this all.
