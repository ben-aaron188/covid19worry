I feel extremely anxious about the future. I graduated with a masters degree in autumn 2020 and am still out of work; this is heavily effected by the pandemic. I feel anxious about myself or people I know getting the corona virus. I’m also anxious about how life will look in the near future regarding restrictions, socialising and job security. 
I feel angry at the government who appear to be less than competent in handling the pandemic when compared to other places such as New Zealand. I think it’s disgusting that politicians have got away with, and continue to get away with, such awful and morally cruel governing.
