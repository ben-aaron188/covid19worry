At the moment I feel okay, it's more of a waiting game so just relaxing and being patient. I've gotten used to working from home, there's the odd office visit which provides a nice break from home and change of scenery. It seems like at least here, we're getting our stuff together and there's some light at the end of the tunnel, to an extent. Obviously, still being cautious and careful.. Unfortunately there's still idiots among us flouting rules, etc. which while the overall news and future looks promising, could easily dive back... A little optimism, possibly. But like i said, with caution!
