The coronavirus has impacted my family as my husband had it in March last year and ended up with pneumonia, which lasted about 12 weeks. He stayed out of hospital - just but has taken a long time to feel himself. He definitely feels a bit depressed at times and has problems breathing. The general feeling is sadness, our sister in law died from Covid a few weeks ago which shows that this is still having an impact and it is not safer to go back to normal just yet. I think there are too many people rushing to socialise and a lot of people who don't see the impact until it affects their loved ones. I'm hoping vaccination will improve things. As a carer I had my first vaccine in February and am having my next one in April. I just hope that the schools and universities can go back soon as it is having a big impact on my son's degree studying from home.
