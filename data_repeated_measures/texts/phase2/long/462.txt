I feel as though I have missed many opportunities in life and crave new experiences. I am hopeful that in the future, I’ll be able to make the most of life post-lockdown and fill it with so many new and exciting experiences. I am appreciative that I have been able to save a lot more in the past year than I normally would and I have slight apprehension about the cost of the life I want to lead post-lockdown. I miss spending time with my loved ones and can feel lonely because I live alone. I think a lot about what the future holds and it’s definitely made me more reflective. I have found that I quite like the distance people stay from each other in public but I miss the opportunity to meet new people.
