Feel fairly positive as cases continue to fall and vaccination rates  increase.  I personally am not too worried about it.  I wish people would continue to follow the rules.  I know very few people who have had it.  A little concerned at returning to school with all the pupils next week.  Concerned that rates of transmission will rise again.  Looking forward to lockdown rules easing and meeting up with friends and family soon.  Happy pressure on the NHS will decline.  Hope to be able to go on holiday in the uk later in the year
