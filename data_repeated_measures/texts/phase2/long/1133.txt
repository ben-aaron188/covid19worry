Ready for it to be over, sick of working from home! Sad that my 16month old has only ever been to 2 baby classes and 1 swimming class! Fed up of hearing about it all to be honest! Dying to see friends and go to the pub...if there are any pubs left round here. My friend had a baby in January 21st and I still haven’t been able to meet him, so that’s been awful for us both. I didn’t even want the vaccine to begin with but I’ll gladly take it now just so I can see my friends....mind you it looks like I’m going to have it if I want to do anything like restaurants and holidays, if the vaccine passport rumours are true....which I think is disgusting
