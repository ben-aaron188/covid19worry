At the moment I feel like the end is coming, but now, I feel worried about what the world will look like after wards. Will we ever have the world as we knew it before? I'm excited to see family and friends, but there are many that have been permanently affected by all this and I'm worried they won't be how I remember them. I'm scared for losing my time and my comfort blanket of isolation. I'm scared about going back to work as I've had so much time off I'm completely re-evaluating what I want to do.
