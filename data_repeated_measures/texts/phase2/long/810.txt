I'm very bored of the whole situation. I am really miss having human contact at both work & in social situations.  

I've kept my job, but know lots of other friends who have not and it's quite diffcult to see the eoconomic issues created by coronavirus. 

My anxiety levels are much higher than they should be because I'm constantly in a state of worry & the quality of my sleep is terrible and has been since the start of lockdown number three. 

I think i'll feel better when i CAN SEE MY FRIENDS and also go to the gym and exercise more regularly.
