I believe people cannot be trusted to follow simple instructions in all walks of life. Therefore there are still cases being found from people who allegedly have been ultra careful. So in essence I believe those people to not have followed the prime path sort by our weak governments. The naysayers of the pandemic should also be re-educated in how their words can alter the visions and actions of the masses, so tv companies also play a huge part in this re-education, their presenters sometimes appear to have their personal agendas for opinion, and not necessarily what the tv station would like to project.
