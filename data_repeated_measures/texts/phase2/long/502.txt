I wish it would go away. I am pleased the government has got it's act together, but we need to come out of these restrictions. It is all dragging on too much and the economy is suffering, as am I as I have lost my job. We also need to consider the huge amount of money the government has spent. It is simply not sustainable. But at least the end seems to be in sight.

On the whole I feel reasonably positive I think. Certainly more that previously. I am pleased to have received the the vaccine, but worried about where it will all end.
