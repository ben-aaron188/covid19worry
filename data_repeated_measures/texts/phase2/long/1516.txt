I am very Bored and anxious about the whole situation. I am very Worried about my children’s mental Health and education. They haven’t seen their friends for so long and it’s really starting to affect them. I really cannot wait for us all to be out of lockdown to start living our lives once again. It would be lovely to book a holiday or pop by and see my friends, out friends and my children’s friends. It’s been a very tough year and it will be fantastic to come out the other end. 
My children are missing their friends and the routine of school and learning in a school environment.
