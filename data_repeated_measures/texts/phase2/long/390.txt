I'm a lot less worried now we have a vaccine and what seems to be a clearer path to some sort of normality. I'm anxious about finding myself in more social situations and just generally how things will be different when we exit this bubble. And also mindful of how it will still be profoundly affecting a lot of the world. I feel grateful that whilst it has affected me and my family mentally and for a time financially,  with regards to the latter, we've ended up being lucky compared to others. I am slightly worried how it will affect us long term, especially my children bit hope they are young and resilient enough for any affect to be minimal.
