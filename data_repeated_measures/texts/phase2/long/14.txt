I am Still worried about family and friends catching it, but hopeful that with the vaccinations that we may see some normality soon and that if people catch it they only have mild symptoms.  I am Hoping that the figures come down and stay low. Worried about how the economy and businesses recover from all the lockdowns and that unemployment will decrease, lucky that I am still in employment. I still feel anxious and still fear that another lockdown will happen or that someone I love will catch it and be seriously ill.
