I was already anxious and worried about my family and friends who I cannot visit, especially when they do not reply swiftly to communication efforts. Today I received the news a friend's relative has passed from the virus which has made this fear and sadness increase. I'm also angered by the government and their lack of support to those affected by this crisis (e.g. how long it takes to apply for Universal Credit). Finally, I also find myself increasingly irritable due to being confirmed to my flat with a housemate.
