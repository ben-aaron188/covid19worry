I try to keep an open mind about it all. Obviously if everyone is sensible things will hopefully work out ok. However, the government must not introduce further dystopian regulations. People NEED to get out and exercise as we don't all have the luxury of big houses and gardens. In addition the government must supply more funds and resources to both the NHS staff and other frontline workers and stop propping up their rich corporate friends instead. They also need to introduce a basic income as their Universal Credit system is a long standing joke and not fit for purpose. Many people are still without a safety net.
