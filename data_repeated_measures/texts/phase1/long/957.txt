I currently feel very worried and scared about the whole situation. I will be glad when everything calms down and hope we can defeat this virus. I have elderly relative and family on the front line therefore I am extremely worried for them and their safety as well as my own health. I do hope that the public start to listen more closely to the Government guidelines to help prevent the spread of the Virus. I agree with the arrangement to close down most stores apart from those providing essentials and decision to ask the public to stay at home.
