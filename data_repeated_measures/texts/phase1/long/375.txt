I feel very anxious. My partner has cancer and has now had two operations cancelled in two weeks due to pressure on the NHS. I am still working from home, as is my partner but our two young children are also at home. I feel like I'm failing at work, failing as a wife and failing as a mother as I can't give any aspects of my life the time and energy they need, yet we're all stuck at home all day everyday. So I feel anxious and worried about my family and we are struggling to get food deliveries booked as we're not classed as vulnerable, although we can't leave the house as we can't afford to get ill and cause my partner to miss their vital operation. It's just a horrible time and our government is failing us, they were too slow and too ineffective.
