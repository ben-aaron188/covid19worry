Anxious. The Prime Minister is in Intensive Care as of this evening. 
As a former nurse I have a good understanding how serious this is, and how fast people can deteriorate. I feel until now an awful lot of people have been dabbling with obeying the rules and this is a HUGE wake up call. 
Four weeks ago I instituted a handwashing station at home, beside the front door, in my utility room. Liquid soap, single use hand drying cloths which go straight into the washing machine. 
A week later I tild my son who works in a supermarket that his uniform had to go straight in the wash when he comes in from work and I started wiping down the groceries with dilute bleach. 
I haven't been out apart from grocery shopping for three weeks and haven't seen my partner, who lives 40 miles away, for three weeks either. I am taking this VERY seriously and was doing all this stuff a long time before my friends were. They thought I was a bit mad, to be honest. 
This is a time where the government say JUMP and the correct response it How High?
