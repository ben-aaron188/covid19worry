I feel extremely anxious. I am a high-risk person as I have multiple auto-immune diseases and I have asthma. I think people do not take it seriously enough and people should be following the rules more carefully. They are putting other peoples lives at risks and it makes me very scared. I worry about the future and how long this will last. Things seem so uncertain right now and it is impossible to tell whether it will get better soon or if it will take a long time for things to go back to how they used to.
