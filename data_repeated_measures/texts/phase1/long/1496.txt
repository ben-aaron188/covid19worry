I am shocked and disappointed at how people are being selfish and are not taking the virus seriously and they are continuing to go out and be social. These people need to understand that by staying in the virus will spread slower and eventually we can all go back to normal. I am scared for my mum and I do not let her go out anywhere. I barely go out even though I am young and healthy. This thing will not end unless we all come together and realise that it's real and it's happening and only we can stop it.
