Really concerned about health of vulnerable family members and my own health. I have already lost one vulnerable relative to coronavirus and have many elderly relatives and vulnerable friends. I feel some anger at the inadequate and delayed Government response to the virus. I am anxious about the economic and social consequences of the pandemic with one daughter furloughed with her job at risk and another trying to follow a degree course through online working with no university contact. I am also concerned that a small number of individuals are not following guidelines for social distancing.
