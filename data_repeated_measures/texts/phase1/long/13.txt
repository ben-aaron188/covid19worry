I am worried that i could gt it and annoyed at the people who are not caring and are still going out socialising. They do not seem to understand that they could be carriers of the virus and could kill someone else with their stupidity, I am having to stay at home due to an autoimmune illness so why can't they. I think this will go on for a longer than it needs to unless there is a lock down that stops people doing what they want to. I am worried and scared as I do not want to die because of someones else being careless.
