Whilst this is clearly a troubling situation, I am trusting that if everybody follows the Government advice, then this will be over soon. 
I am fortunate that I have a nice house and garden to be able to stay at home and i have just had a family quiz via zoom with all of my family. Whilst it is difficult not to see them in person, i do actually speak to them more on a daily basis.  I have stopped watching the news as it makes me angry at the presenters who are clearly trying to stir up issues and therefore i am more relaxed. I only follow the official guidance.
