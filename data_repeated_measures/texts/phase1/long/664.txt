I am anxious for my older relatives in case they catch the virus and fearful of their safety, especially when they have other health issues that mean they have to go to hospitals for appointments. I feel anxious when I go food shopping that everything we are doing is being watched and scrutinised for errors. I feel sad when my 3 year old is crying because she misses her friends and wants to go the park and she doesn't really understand why we can't go. I feel lucky to have a safe house and small garden to spend our lockdown in and happy to be seeing more of my husband and daughter.
