I am very anxious because I believe that I have had the virus, but cannot be sure until I get an antibody test - which is not likely to become available until the 'herd immunity' can be estimated. So the anxiety remains. I am cross that the situation has not been managed well, but realise that the correct methodology for handling it will only become evident in hindsight. That does not relieve my anxiety. I particularly feel empathy for those who are suffering worse than I did. Most of all, I am anxious for my family members - especially my children and their children.
