I do not feel hugely panicked or anxious for mine or those close to me's health, as I am comforted by the fact none of us are vulnerable with underlying health conditions and are undertaking all the social distancing precautions. However, I am sad and anxious in regards to the impact of isolation on my mental health and the implications this will have on my academic career with all forms of education shutting. Also, I have empathy for those who are affected and are tasked with fighting the pandemic on the frontlines, and am saddened by their stories.
