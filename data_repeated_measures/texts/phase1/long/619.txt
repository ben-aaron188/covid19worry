I feel afraid because it's likely that my family or friends may be affected by this. I believe the government are doing everything they can but a lot of it is so unknown that it is difficult for them to know what action to take and this worries me. I also worry about the impact on the economy and how this will affect my children as they grow up. It is the unknown element of all of these factors that makes me feel anxious about this situation. It has been nice to spend time with my family but that is overshadowed by the horrible disease and the amount of people dying from it.
