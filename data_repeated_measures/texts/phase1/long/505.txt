Not too worried, not stressed much. Can't change whats happening so just getting on with things and using the time to get things done. I think the main problem is the press and media causing most of the panic and constantly going on about it, most of what they say are lies or just wrong. I don't watch the news much but can see it affecting other people. Main thoughts about it have been about planning incase it comes around again next year so don't end up stuck at home or short on things. Making sure I keep fit and healthy just incase I got it but not making many other changes.
