At this very moment, I feel sad about the rising death toll, however I do not know anyone personally affected so I am perhaps a little naive to the severity. I am not too anxious, but would be devastated if people close to me become affected. I was struggling last week and felt quite depressed, but this week I am feeling more uplifted and excited about things and have planned things to do. I am worried how long it will go on for and how I will cope and the severity it might get too. Today I feel more upbeat.
