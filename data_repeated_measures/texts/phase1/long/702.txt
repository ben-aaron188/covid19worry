Emotions and anxiety are quite debilitating 
I miss my family so much and I worry for them
I'm so proud of my NHS working daughter but so worried for her safety
It is an alien situation. I am proud of my elderly parents who seem to be managing better than I am.
I am fearful when I leave the house and am paranoid not to come into contact with anyone. I take antibacterial wipes everywhere and constantly wipe surfaces and my hands
I feel helpless for my family and I am fighting not to be redeployed frontline with my nhs job
