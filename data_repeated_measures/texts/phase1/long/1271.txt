I feel anxious for myself and my family. The knowledge that this will go on indefinitely and relationships and approaches to life will now be changed forever make me sad. I try to be upbeat for my kids but it’s difficult when I don’t have answers for them. 

I worry that the hospitalisation Of the prime minister will instigate panic amongst people and I already try to avoid social media as it makes me more anxious. 

I miss being able to see friends and family easily and the simple pleasures of picnics in the park with my kids, being stupid know a flat with no outside space
