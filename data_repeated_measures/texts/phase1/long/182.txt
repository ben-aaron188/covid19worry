Feeling a bit down thinking about all this isolation and feeling like a prisoner in your own house.  Never have we had to go through something like this and it is scary thinking about how this will end and when.  Feeling sad that I can't see my children and grandchildren and hope it won't be for long. Sometimes  I feel vulnerable especially when out in the street and people are about, makes you think how easy it would be to spread this disease. I also feel hope that life can be better when this is over and we can rejoice with our families.
