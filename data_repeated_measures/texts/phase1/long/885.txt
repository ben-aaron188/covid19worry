I worry about my friends and family. I really miss seeing my Mum who is isolating at her house all alone. Even though we communicate over video on my phone 

I feel very penned in at home. Somedays i feel like i'm climbing the walls.

I hope things go back to normal soon! It's my Birthday today and it's been a very strange sort of day not seeing friends or family or being able to go out for a meal.

I struggle to keep my daughter who is nearly 4 entertained all day and try to take her for a walk in the fresh air every day.
