I think It's the uncertainty thats got me worried. How long will be inside; Can the economy recover after this? Will I lose my Job? Will my parents lose their jobs?

Staying at home does get frustrating and I am sad that we may be here all through summer, but I will do what I need to i.e. stay at home, as I am doing my part to save the NHS.

Seeing people outside, having picnics gets me annoyed as they maybe spreading it and causing everyone to stay at home longer.

I think the government should do more to reinforce staying at home, make the policies strict so people are forced to stay at home.
