I'm a bit scared and trying not to leave my house when it's not needed. I'm taking care of my baby son so I must be ever more careful as I'm also responsible for him. Im not doing shopping anymore as this is getting done by my husband from now as going to the shop with a baby that just started to walk would be a huge risk. To catch some 'fresh' air we are having fun at the garden from time to time as sitting at home can become really depressing especially with the little one alone. It's a tough time for everyone and in my opinion people should stay at home if they have a possibility but at the weekend I hear groups of drunk people outside so I do not really think that all the people taking the situation seriously.
