I am quite anxious about how long this may last for and the possibility of my family getting unwell. I'm also concerned about the financial repercussions for my family. It's quite hard working from home and trying to help children with schoolwork, however I am relieved that we are safe at home and not at any more risk than we have to be. I'm disappointed in the people who are not sticking to the distancing rules though, meaning that more people are being put at risk. I am quite sad about all of the people who have lost their lives and really feel for their families and loved ones, and am massively appreciative of all of the frontline and medical workers that are still trying their best in what must be awful circumstances sometimes. Thanks
