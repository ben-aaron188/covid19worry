It's strange as I would normally be worrying every second of the day about a situation like this but for some reason, my mind is choosing to block a lot of it out. The main feelings I am having are anger at the people who are not staying indoors and sadness for those who have no choice because of work - why should my lovely mum have to go and work at the hospital every day, putting herself at risk, while there are total idiots waltzing around willy nilly. These people are putting other peoples lives at risk - legal manslaughter some might even call it!  Sometimes I get a sudden panic and a flash of how serious it is but other than that I am just going with the flow.
