I'm incredibly worried.  I know people are recovering etc, but the news on TV paints a much bleaker picture and it's such a worry.  I have (mild) asthma and I really hope I don't get it because of that.  I do only go out rarely for urgent things but other than that I am incredibly careful with washing my hands etc.  I suffer with bad anxiety anyway but all this going on is making it much much worse.  I miss everyday things, I miss my family and I miss normality.  I pray it's over very soon because it's becoming a nightmare.
