I am aware of the severity of the situation and I am worried for my family and friends who may contract the virus and be negatively affected whether financially, mentally etc. . However, I am enjoying being furloughed from work and being able to take time for myself, even if it is making me slightly anxious about my financial situation. It is showing me and others what the important things are in life and it's changing my mindset on how I'll use my free time in the future. But it is frustrating to me that I can't do a lot of the things I want to do like leave the house when I want to.
