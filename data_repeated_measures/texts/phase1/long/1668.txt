This is a very stressful time. Not least because of the deaths and illness occurring. Isolation is also leading to illness and deaths through suicide. It's scary to think about how individuals, particularly those at risk, are coping. As someone with a mental health difficulty I find it easier to cope in times of chaos, albeit it seems confusing to me the state of the world and uncertainty we are facing. Being in 'lock-down' is a very necessary step, and it angers me that some individuals are not following the guidance and advice put in place. Conspiracy theories also anger me, such as with 5G, as it trivialises the situation at hand
