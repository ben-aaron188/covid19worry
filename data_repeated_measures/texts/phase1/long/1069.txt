I am strangely enjoying the freedom that lock down brings, I look out the window, see birds (and now identify them), using delivery companies that I wouldn't normally use - small producers for example. I am enjoying the emptiness of diaries, finding out more about online activities and social media channels that I have avoided until now. Relaxed and happy. Got a jigsaw on the go, have started some OU courses, doing online exercise, a stack of books, cooking interesting things that take time. However, I realise that I am hugely lucky, have a garden and a dog which make all the difference in the world.
