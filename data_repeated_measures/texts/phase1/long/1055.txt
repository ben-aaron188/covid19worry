I feel anxious about the situation, normal life has been completely disrupted, finances are up in the air and no one knows if and when things will return to normal. 

Added to this people, of all ages are dying suddenly from such a horrible virus. The virus doesn't discriminate or care and there is very little, it seems, we can do to prevent or recover from this illness.

I feel nervous about how long this will go on for, what the future will be like and how both mine and my partner's professions will recover following this. I am also nervous about my health and the health of my friends, families and colleagues.
