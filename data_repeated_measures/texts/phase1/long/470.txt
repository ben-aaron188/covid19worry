I am feeling very anxious about the unknown, because nobody knows how is it going to end up. I have also been worrying about if my family catch the virus and lose their life to it. It is very scary and stressful time. I just want it to all be over. Hopefully it will be soon, but I fear it wonâ€™t be soon enough. Stay safe everyone and follow the guidelines, please. If not for yourself then do it for your future generations. Stay at home and thankful forever for our amazing NHS workers! Absolute heroes
