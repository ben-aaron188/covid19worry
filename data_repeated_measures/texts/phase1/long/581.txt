I am a bit worried as part of my family resides in one of the countries most affected by the virus, so the constant depressing news you hear on the TV, radio or internet are no help in improving my mood. As for myself, I try to stay positive as much as I can and I try to enjoy this moment as a way to slow down, focus on my wellbeing and especially take care of my health. I am lucky enough to have a garden, so I've tried to spend time gardening or just sitting in the sun  since the weather has been great lately. I keep in touch with relatives and friends through texts, calls and video calls.
