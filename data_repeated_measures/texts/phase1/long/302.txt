I am sad that people have to die from this virus. I am anxious to some extent as my health may make me more vulnerable. I am relaxed as I am working from home and my family is as secure as possible. Whilst I appreciate working from home, I realise that there is still a significant risk of catching the virus and fear becoming unfit As the only exercise I get is walking the dog in the evening. I am relieved that none of my family has been ill, but worry what will Happen if urgent care beds are available and one is needed
