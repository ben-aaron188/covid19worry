It is hard to relax at the moment with everything on the news and so much disruption to basic living.  I feel frustrated at not being able to pop out to the shops to get food, without feeling like I could be in serious danger!  It has meant I have had to order things from various websites other than the supermarkets (who are completely booked up and unavailable) which is a hassle and doesn't include fresh produce.  But it is better than nothing and at least I feel safer with an older family member here so we are not risking ourselves by going out.  Just have to hang in there and hope this too shall pass!
