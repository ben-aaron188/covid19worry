Whilst I'm not worried/concerned too much for myself I feel worried for the people that I love and all those who are considered vulnerable. I'm somewhat irritated by those who do not feel that the rule applies to them. It's not about you alone at this time. It's the impact that you could have on others. And I'm sad to hear of all the deaths and the people that this is affecting. It's heartbreaking that these people are dying without the usual attendance of family members. 
I feel helpless as I don't live near family who are in need and so the burden has landed with other members of the family who are now exhausted, anxious and worried. This upsets me that I can do very little to help. So I feel a little helpless. That said, we all have to do our part and I remind myself that the kindest thing I can do is not visit loved ones. I'm a little concerned that the government will lift these rules too soon. We have one shot at this.
