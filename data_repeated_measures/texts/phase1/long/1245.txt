Scared of losing family members. Scared of catching the virus and infecting other family members  Feeling alone as our family unit is isolated from the rest of our family. Anxious as there doesn't seem to be a way that we can get out of the current situation safely. Anxious about vaccination and medication becoming available in a timely manner. Scared for family members going outside, scared of going out myself. In need of dental treatment as I've broken a tooth that I can't get looked at. Fearful of losing my job even though I am currently on furlough
