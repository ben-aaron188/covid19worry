Tremendous anxiety and fear, especially for others, most especially for anyone who HAS to be exposed to the possibility of infection (for whatever reason). 
I am cross about anyone who persists in not taking this virus seriously. I'm really cross about people in positions of power who are not doing their job. I should have put the 'anger' slider on 9 but I feel so distanced from them it didn't seem honest. 
I also feel fatalistic. 
Sometimes I think this pandemic has been a long time coming.
Sometimes, I wonder if the virus is a 'natural' cull to give the planet time to breathe a little.
I also feel overwhelmed if I dwell on it all for too long, or read too much about it. 
I worry for the animals.
I hope that if we come out the other side, a better life for everyone will emerge.
