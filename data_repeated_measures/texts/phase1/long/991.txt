At the moment I feel a bit fed up of it, I'm sad I can't make plans at the moment and I miss having a social life. I feel anxious for my friends and family but I also feel safe and a little more relaxed than usual to be temporarily in isolation. I feel hopeful that the situation will improve in the coming weeks. I feel anxious on a daily basis, at this moment I feel a little less anxious than usual but nonetheless anxious and I feel fear most days, including today. Even when at home right now I feel fear due to the constant headline updates.
