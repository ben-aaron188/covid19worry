I feel sad as my brain can't quite comprehend the impact all the daily deaths are having on people's lives. I am fortunate so far that it has not impacted my immediate friends or family but it scares me that this could quickly change. I feel I want to know about all these poor people on one hand, but on the other I am quite happy to continue in my little bubble. While at home each day able to do things that I've needed to do for a long time I am not feeling the full impact, despite the daily life restrictions.
