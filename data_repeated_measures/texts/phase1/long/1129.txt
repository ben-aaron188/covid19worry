I am beginning to become more relaxed about the corona situation as I begin to settle in to this new way of living. I have started to avoid news reports because of the sadness the stories and stats bring me - I am really struggling to cope with the concept of this 'needless' death. I have become a lot less anxious - of course I am wary of catching the virus but I have now accepted that fate is what it will always be, we can only take actions ourselves to minimise risk; we can never truly be free of the risk of this virus.
