I feel increasingly concerned around the current situation and have been going to check the news everyday, something I did not do prior. It is also making me change my situation by needing to ration food and other items. This has also caused a drastic change in my college work, and has caused massive disruptions which is worrying me for my results later in the year and additionally how progressing onto a university degree is going to affect me in the future. I am facing a general increase in worry for what is next and not only that but for my surrounding family members, some of which are elderly and have health conditions however I am trying to take it day be day and trying to remain calm, however that thought of worry is always pondering in my mind.
