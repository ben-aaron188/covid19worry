I am anxious as I do not know what is going to happen. I am worried that my family members might get it and i'm sad that I haven't seen anyone for so long other than my kids and partner. it worries me that anyone could be carrying symptoms and not know it. too many people aren't taking this seriously enough and it worries me.i don't want anyone I know to die from coronavirus as you can't even give anyone a proper funeral just now. there is too much uncertainty but I'm trying to stay strong for my children.
