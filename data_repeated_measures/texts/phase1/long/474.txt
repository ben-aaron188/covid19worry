The prime minister just went into ICU, so my anxiety and fear it high at the moment. My chest feels tight. This is huge.

I am not anxious about lockdown or staying at home - I am anxious about the number of people in the UK needing the ICU and our NHS’s ability to cope.

I am anxious that the curve is not flattening quickly. Will this end? How many people will be lost.

I am worried people out there working, such as my ICU nurse sister in law and feel guilty surrounding any deliveries we have.
I worry about my job and my own company and I wonder about the ethics of luxuries and I worry about people who may be suicidal. So many emotions. It’s many ups and downs but right now my fear is very high and my thoughts are racing. This is a scary moment
