I find it quite stressful, as although my family is abiding by the guidelines, others around us do not. The govt needs to enforce stricter lockdown rules or this will just go on and on. Employers is particular need to stop calling themselves essential and making their staff go into a shared space needlessly. Most people want to do the right without the fear of being sacked.  Loan repayments, mortgages , bills etc need to be frozen with NO interest being added , we should not be made to pay for something out of our control and not reacted to quickly enough by the Govt.
