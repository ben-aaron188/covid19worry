I feel okay about it, but my emotions go through a vast range each day. I am anxious about it if I think too much about it, I'm worried as my partner is a paramedic and I worry about him. I worry about my mum getting or someone I love getting sick with it. It's not nice being outside as everyone looks at you with distrust and fear but I miss going out and seeing friends and family and living my life. I do like having more time at home and not travelling through London so much and I also like having more time with my daughter and my partner. But overall its a very scary and worrying time.
