I feel worried and anxious, predominately about what the future holds. Whether I will still be employed soon and I’m also worried about my husband/children and family that live further away. It makes me feel sad thinking about people who are less fortunate and don’t have enough money or have lost jobs. I worry about the impact on their children. It makes me really sad and it also angers me that I can’t do anything for them to help them. I fear for my mental health, I fear that this is now going to deteriorate as I’ve recently moved areas and I don’t know when I’ll be able to get treatment again.
