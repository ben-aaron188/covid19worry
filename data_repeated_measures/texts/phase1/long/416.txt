Hi, I feel very concerned about the future of our human beings. I feel like it is a bad dream and hope that one day I will wake up and I realis e that this was just a bad dream. I feel scared and hope that soon scientists will come up with a remarkable cure and ðŸ’‰.  I am truly frightened. Everyday I watch news on the television and see the horror people go through in the whole world. I am deeply saddened to see how many people died. It is awful and I am deeply shocked and anxious. I feel this virus is man made and not something that just happened because why it would not happen a few years ago, or ever.
