Right now, I feel calm and quite relaxed about the Corona situation. This is because I've finished work for the day (and I'm very thankful to still be working from home, as I did prior to the pandemic, as it gives me a purpose during the weekdays) and I've been for a walk which cleared my head. I am of course worried about a lot of things to do with the virus but right now, including the health of my family and what the socioeconomic impact to the UK and the whole world will be. But right now I can see the bigger picture that it will pass, that this is an experience which we have to ride, and we will return to normal at some point hopefully this year.
