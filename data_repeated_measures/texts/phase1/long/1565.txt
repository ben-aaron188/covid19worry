I am worried for my familys physical health incase they become ill and also their mental health, particularly my daughter who is 9.  I am angry and disgusted at people who do not follow the guidance in relation to staying at home and feel guilty if and when I leave the house, although I know I am sticking to the rules. 

The news of Boris Johnson being hospitalised is concerning me,  

I find myself very emotional and crying easily at things such as the Queens broadcast last night and silly programmes on the TV.
