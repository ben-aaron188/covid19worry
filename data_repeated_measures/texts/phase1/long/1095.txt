I’m really worried me or my family will get ill. I’m worried who would take care of my kids if I am ill. I am worried about being taken to hospital all alone. Worried about how I can get grocery delivery slots. I feel like this is never going to end. I am just worried all the time about it. I feel like the virus is getting really bad in this country now. I am checking the daily figures when they get announced on the website every day. My family are also quite worried and I have elderly relatives which is a concern for us.
