At this moment i time i feel relaxed, i am doing everything i can to protect myself and the people i love and care about. I am staying in and only going out to replenish food supplies every 10 or so days. I feel that i am doing everything that i physically can to protect myself and my family. I am not as anxious as i was last week, i can see that people around me in my local area are also keeping to the rules and advice from the government about staying in and everyone seems to be practicing social distancing.
