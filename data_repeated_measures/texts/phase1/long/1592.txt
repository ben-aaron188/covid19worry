I'm incredibly concerned for the health of my close family. My parents are both in the most vulnerable age range, and my father in particular has health concerns. My sister works in the NHS as a home carer, visiting people in their homes, which puts her at tremendous risk. Personally, my finances are in a bad state of affairs as I work in entertainments and have had no work at all for several weeks and no income. I'm struggling to pay for food.
The lockdown itself hasn't bothered me too much, I've been able to keep myself busy so far, but the general anxiety of the growing crisis edging ever closer to my life is causing me some distress.
