I am worried for my family. I try not to read the news anymore
There is a new case all time and I'm so worried. I clean all my shopping with disinfectant wipes when it arrives. I shower when u come in from the garden. I can't sleep at night because scary thoughts come into my mind.  No body is safe. Look at Boris. The world has complety changed and I worry for my family in the future and now.
Can't buy anything from my shop. Can't even get a home delivery slot.
There is no getting away from it even if i wanted to.
