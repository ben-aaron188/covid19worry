I feel mainly anxiety for myself and fear for my family - I am a front line health care worker, and care for a frail relative, my anxiety stems from being worried about passing on covid to my relative. Work is very very stressful and demanding at the moment, but I am able to leave that at work to a degree. I am somewhat envious of friends complaining at being bored while stuck at home on full pay.... I tell them to stop moaning, enjoy the headspace they are getting and stay home to make my job easier!
