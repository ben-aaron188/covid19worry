I feel galvanised into action, to fill the shortfall created by government.

 I feel worried for others more than my self. I desire change off the back off this crisis for a better society, and hope this will refocus what and who we prioritise. 

I enjoy working from home, I am lucky to have a job where I am busier than ever and can add value. 

My family are as safe as they can be, and those most at risk are trying to take every precaution. 

I am looking for the possibility in the situation, and I am an optimist.
