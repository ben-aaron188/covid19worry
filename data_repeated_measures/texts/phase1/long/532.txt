At the moment I feel confused and worried by the situation, on one hand it is very worrying and the fear of the situation is great.  I am very concerned about the economic situation, the state of the NHS and society as a whole.  I also worry about the older generation who are more susceptible to falling ill, although the disease is not being full ageist in who it affects 
but on the other hand staying at home with my family and not rushing around to school drop off, commuting and working full time is is good  
i feel relaxed when i am with my family but then you open the front door and the realisation hits you of what is happening
