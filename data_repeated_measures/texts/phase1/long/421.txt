I feel worried that a cure won’t be found, I feel anxious about getting it or passing it to my children. I’m worried for the economy and how the country will cope if this carries on any longer. I am worried that there will be riots at some point. Every one seem to be turning on each other, and grocery stores are becoming like a battle ground. Everyone is on edge and snappy and I really don’t like where this country is headed. I have been at home with my children because all schools have shut down. I haven’t seen my family in over a month now, my children’s lives are being changed so drastically and I don’t know how much longer we can manage financially.
