I am very worried about the situation. I am currently working from home and have been for 3 weeks. I work for an older peopleâ€™s charity so am reminded of how serious this is daily. Sometimes I have brief moments where I forget but then I watch the news or the queens speech and it brings it home. I am anxious for my loved ones and also very angry at the people still not doing what we are being told to do. It is a simple task to stay in doors and I cannot understand the stupidity and arrogance of people who think they can do what they want whilst the rest of us suffer.
