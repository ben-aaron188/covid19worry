Very anxious and what is going to happen, when we we are going to be let our, when can I see my family again.  I have a young boy who is missing out on alot of things, learning new things and exploring new places he is really struggling with staying in, staying in a flat with no garden and only go for a walk once a day. He just does not understand, he doesnt undetanad that hes now allowed out. He is stressed anxious not sleeping properly because he doesnt get any fresh air or enough stimulation. I'm anxious he will get it or I will and then what will happen
