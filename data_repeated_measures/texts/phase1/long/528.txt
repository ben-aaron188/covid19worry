I am just sad everyday especially when i hear the daily statistics of how many people have been infected and how many have died all alone. It is a vey unfortunate situation for the world and everyone to be going through. I hope it gets resolved as soon as possible as the world has been changed forever by this virus. We definitely will not be able to go back to normal again whatever normal is. I hope the people at the frontline doctors/nurses and all essential care workers are protected and well rewarded now and when all this is over
