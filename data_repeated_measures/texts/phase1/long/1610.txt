I am a little worried about my future and my education, as I am not sure when things will start up again, or how I will get my qualifications. The whole lock-down situation does not worry me because it means I am able to relax with my family, and learn how to do new things. I am worried more about the repercussions of the virus than the illness itself, such as how I would cope if some of my vulnerable relatives contracted the disease, or how society would cope after measures are lifted. I think that the panic buying is incredulous, as there is no reason anyone would need to buy more than they usually do just because they are not allowed out of the house as often.
