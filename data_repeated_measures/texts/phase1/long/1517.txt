I am anxious about people dying and being seriously ill, particularly people I care about. I worry about my parents and grandmother. However,in terms of the economic consequences, I think this could be a good thing in the medium to long term. We may have a fundamental rethink as to how we structure our economy and compensate certain workers. As somebody who owns no assets currently, we may also get a long overdue drop in house prices which would be very welcome for me and I'm sure millions of workers who currently feel left behind.
