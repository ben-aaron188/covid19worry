I feel worried about the Corona situation. Our prime minister is currently in intensive care, and I fear for my elderly parents. I am dreading the prospect of months under lockdown. I am also concerned about the long-term impact on the economy - of my favourite shops closing - and the likelihood of austerity politics returning. I am concerned about the welfare of my family and friends, and whether or not they may be made redundant.
I am working from home but don't particularly like this arrangement, and worry about the vulnerable patients that I work with.
