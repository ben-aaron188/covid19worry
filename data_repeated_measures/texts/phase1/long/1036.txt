I am sad that I can’t meet with my family and friends. Concerned for my 79 year old Mum who lives alone in another town. It is a difficult situation as we have never experienced anything like this. I believe the government is doing its best, but obviously some things aren’t going to plan for one reason or another. After we have come through this a plan needs to be devised as to how best to deal with any future virus. I think we as a country need to continue to grow our own resources for future epidemics.
