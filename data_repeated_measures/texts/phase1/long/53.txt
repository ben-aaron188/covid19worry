somewhat anxious but doing my best to stay balanced. I hope we won't be affected, we are following the recommended advice in order to stay safe. Not sure what else I can say. It is worrying but we are adapting to the situation. It is frightening hearing some of the details, and it can also be annoying to hear of people behaving in helpful ways, and to have to listen to colleagues boasting of their isolation activities. I wonder how long it will go on for and hope we can cope. we are trying to be brave
