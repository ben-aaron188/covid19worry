I feel anger and disgust at seeing people still going out to see their friends and partners while I am sacrificing all that for the safety of myself and everyone else. I am feeling very stressed and anxious due to having 3 university Master's exams, multiple assignments still to hand in and a dissertation on top of this already stressful situation. It is hard to be happy and get back in to a routine when I don't know when this is all going to end. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to as every thing I had planned has been cancelled. I know it's for the best but it is hard to cope at this time.
