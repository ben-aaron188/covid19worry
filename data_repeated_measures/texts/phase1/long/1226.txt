I cry every day, and feel hopeless a lot of the time - the complete turmoil in routines and permanent uncertainty is really difficult as someone who's struggling to cope healthily with anxiety and an eating disorder, and my little time in nature each day is the sole source of solace at the moment. I deeply miss and worry about my family and feel terribly sad for everyone facing similar feelings and far worse. I am doing what I can to help, including volunteering, and trying to focus on work, though I feel frequently distracted, unable to focus, despairing, and though I can't concentrate a troubling amount of the time. I feel sorry for the country and world in the long-term as well as the current time. We need each other and connecting only online or by phone feels exhausting and draining too much of the time. I am grateful and feel lucky to have beautiful countryside around me and the ability to walk and run in it. It is one of the few calming presences in my days. I know there are many facing far more awful situations and feel guilty for struggling so much.
