A bit anxious about how long it is taking to get things under control, especially considering Europe is the worst affected place in the world with the USA a close second. Countries with good healthcare systems struggling to contain a virus isn't a reassuring sign because once the virus gets a foothold in poorer countries and countries with a lower quality of healthcare, it can spread and kill like wildfire. I'm also confused about the UK government's management at times and what I, as an individual, can and can't do. As I write this, I am in my house I live in during term time for university, and I am unsure whether I can come back home to family
