I feel relaxed because I am keeping myself busy and I try to be productive in order to keep my mind off the Corona situation. I am also happy because I am productive and I keep achieving my goals. Not to mention that we live in an era that we are able to communicate with one another instantly and so I feel grateful that I live in this era and I can amuse myself all the time without feeling bored. Additionally, I am also feeling concentrated on my tasks and focused. Overall, I am feeling good with the Corona situation and very little anxiety as well as very little fear.
