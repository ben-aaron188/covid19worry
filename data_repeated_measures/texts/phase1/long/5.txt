i feel very up in the air.im also concerned we were told that it didnt really affect some people,like the young.But it is and that frightens me.
im worried about money as im self employed,i just wish we knew when it would end.
i worry about my family.
im also very annoyed that people arent taking it seriously.
it seems very surreal,i cant belive this is happening.
its a scary situation and i cant see how this can end,but it will end so the positivity has to be there.
queen did very well
we will meet again.
