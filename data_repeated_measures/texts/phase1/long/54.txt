Worried about the government response especially now Boris johnson is in intensive care and unable to lead the country. Nurses and medics are dying and there is not enough personal protection equipment to keep staff safe. I feel quite anxious and stressed about the future and the impact on my family particularly my children who are in their twenties.
My elderly mother and my father in law are both self isolating and they are lonely and no real idea how this will end. The ecomonic impacts will be felt for a long time after the pandemic has passed.
