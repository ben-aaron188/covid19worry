A confusing time with many contrasting thoughts. Future seems extinct and very lonely, sad, skint and worried. The uncertainty is the worst thing. I feel the big businesses and banks and super rich will be the only beneficiaries of this. A cruel world. I feel like its dog eat dog and the only way is to be ruthless. The government have been indecisive, however I think they are just puppets dancing to the pied piper. How much longer can we go on? What will the country and indeed world look like after this? Are these measures necessary?
