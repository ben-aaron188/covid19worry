At the moment, I'm quite worried about the situation. I have Diabetes and asthma and I don't want to catch COVID-19. I'm annoyed that certain members of the population are not obeying the terms of the Lockdown and putting us at risk of catching the virus.  I'm also angry at our ineffective government for not acting sooner with the Lockdown and for not putting enough money into the NHS. Actually, I'm angrier about this than I thought I was. Hopefully in the next 10-14 days this whole thing will start to resolve itself.
