I am angry that we are being forced inside and patronised by the government. I fully understand that there is a reason to stay indoors, but the whole country are being treated like naughty school children when they have the right to go outside if they are selfish enough to do so. Leaving the house is a basic human right and it is infuriating that it has to be taken away from us. 

I am also anxious about the health and wellbeing of my grandparents. Despite my feelings above, I am extremely concerned that they will be caught up in it and I don't want that to happen. I have no concerns for myself.
