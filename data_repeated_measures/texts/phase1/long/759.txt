I am stressed and afraid, worries about my family and friends.  I'm angry at the government who ignored the warning signs and didn't prepare for such an event deposits being told years ago that they were underprepared.  I'm also angry at the people who are letting everyone down and disgusted by the celebrities and billionaires claiming we're all in the same boat while they are living in mansions with pools and grounds and with the money to help but doing nothing. I miss my partner and hope this will be over soon. I am inspired by communities as the whole.
