I feel very frightened and worried for the safety of my family and myself. I feel very out of control of the situation and feel extremely negative about what the outcome will be for the world. I feel ashamed that I am locking my family away to protect them and in doing so not helping others. 
The coverage on the news makes me more and more frightened every day not only because of the corona virus but also with how the government is dealing with the situation. I also feel that the police are becoming too strict and this also concerns me with regard to if they will relax this when the pandemic is over. I also feel angry towards people not following the rules and putting everyone in potential danger.
