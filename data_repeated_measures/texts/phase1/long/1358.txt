I am currently pregnant and so this time is worrying as although it is said that mainly old and vulnerable people are affected by the virus more and more healthy people are becoming sick and dying. I am worried that only babies that were already at the end of pregnancy have been born and the affects in early pregnancy are not yet known.
I have a slight anger at the government for the lack of testing that seems to be happening and also at people who do not seem to think that following the social distancing applies to them. I am also worried about the financial aspect going forward.
