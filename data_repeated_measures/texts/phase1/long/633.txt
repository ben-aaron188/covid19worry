I feel sad that I can't see my grandparents. I feel like it's  a year wasted when I was going to try and better myself from my anxiety and depression. I can't do that now as we can't go out. I hope I get more good years with my mum and dad to make up for this year. I'm missing thing's like the concerts and football and going out. Going to visit my grandparents on a Tuesday afternoon. But I know that it is all to keep thme safe. It's annoying me that others are flouting the rules and putting others lives in danger
