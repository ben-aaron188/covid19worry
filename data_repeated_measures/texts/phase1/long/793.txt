I feel slightly worried about the situation. There isn't enough support being provided by the government. No one knows for certain when things will return to normal and things will get better. I'm also worried about my job security, if i'll have a job in couple months, and if i'll be able to support myself or if i'll not be able to pay bills and rent. I feel worried to go outside and interact with people out of fear that i might contract the virus and then pass it onto someone else which could be multiple people out of work for a couple weeks
