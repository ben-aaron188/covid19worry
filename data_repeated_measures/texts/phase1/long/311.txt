I think, as mentioned before, fear is the only feeling I can think of that represents my current mood. Fear about the uncertainty of the virus, fear about getting the virus and not being able to be treated to the extent that I would need/want to as other thousands of people will be needing help at the same time, fear of losing any loved one. As person I always like to plan things in my life and at this moment I feel like im incapable of making any plan about how to move forward from this. All these thoughts and feeling as running in my head constantly every singe day. Unfortunately being from another EU country that has taken humungous measures and hearing daily about the possitive impact that these rule have on my country, I feel betrayed by the UK how is supposed to be a better country, with more resources and better healthcare, as in my opinion government does not do enough in order to protect its people.
