I am worried about the country and the vunerable people who could catch the virus.  Trying to imagine what life will be like when we come out of lockdown in the uk. I feel that the jobless figures will rise and many firms will not re-open.  I am sure the the uk will comeback from this situation, but I feel life will be different for many people.  Being older it does not effect me too much except for the fear of catching the virus, but for the younger generation they have only ever known fairly good times and being able to buy what they require on credit and feel safe in the knowledge that they will be able to work hard and repay the debt.
