I am worried about my mother who is over 65, and also feel sorry for her as she lives alone and hasn't seen anyone in ages. I am worried about caring for my baby. I want to go out and meet friends and go places. I am bored. I feel sorry for anyone who dies and their families. I am worried about the financial situation in the future and how we will survive financially in a few months time. I am worried I will lose a lot of work and also I was planning on looking for a full time job and I do not think I will be able to find one. I also feel sad for all the nice plans we had for travel and meeting up with friends that cannot happen
