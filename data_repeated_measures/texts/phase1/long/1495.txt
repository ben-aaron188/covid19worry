I feel afraid for myself my friends and my family. I hate being under house arrest but understand the reasons why I have limited movement. I am very angry that the UK government are still allowing foreign nationals to enter the UK whilst this is going on as it defeats the object of doing all this in my opinion. I am not sure when all this is going to end but I get the feeling late June/July is the first time I am going to see a resemblance of normality. I am glad that at least on my weekly trip to Tesco's that the shelves are now returning to normal and that people have stopped panic buying items which was just totally stupid.
