I feel resigned to it really, we'll just have to wait and see. I don't mind abiding by the social distancing etc, although it's a bit frustrating that I now have to go out to the supermarket in person rather than getting a delivery which I've always done in the past. 
I'm not frightened or worried. It will pass. It will be interesting to see how the world reconfigures itself after all this. I hope it doesn't all go back to normal, let's have a new normal with some things at least being different.
