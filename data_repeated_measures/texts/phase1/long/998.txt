The Corona virus is causing a great deal of suffering for people across the world and is going to affect each and every one of us in some way.  I really hope we can all use it to review the ways we have been living and the things we have taken for granted and change the way we live our lives for the better into the future.  We need to look after the most vulnerable in these times and protect those who care for us when we need it.  Hopefully this will give the people of the world a renewed perspective on what is really important to us as humans.
