I am angry how the British public have dealt with the situation. The virus, while not killing as many as Swine flu, could become far worse if people don't take the situation seriously. It feels like the public care little for those who are vulnerable and wish they would die so they can get on with their lives. I fear the public may soon begin to riot if the lockdown continues for longer than April, this would leader to further spreading of the virus and more deaths.
I have been locked away in isolation for 37+ days because I am high risk. I am stressed and miserable. I live with my wife and try my best not to be stressed and upset as it would make the situation worse for her.
