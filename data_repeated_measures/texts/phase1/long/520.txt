I think this pandemic really shows people's true colours. How people and organizations react to crises. I feel a fair bit disappointed and disheartened by how most people has been reacting, to the point where I feel perhaps we deserve this pandemic (although I'm aware many good people have and will lose their lives to this fight). Perhaps we need a bit of cleansing. I almost feel a bit disappointed how with this virus, since it's not really that deadly (not with the current strain anyway) we won't nearly end up as many deaths as would be considered as a ""cleansing"". What we'll get is an economic meltdown. I'm worried as I'll be graduating straight in a long and global recession.
