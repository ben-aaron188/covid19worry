At the moment it feels like suppressing  sadness. You forget it’s there for a while, do ‘normal’ tasks and then it hits you how scary the current situation is. It’s the fear of the unknown. You’re pretty sure you and your family are going to get the virus but there’s no way of knowing how bad the symptoms could be. It’s anxiety for family and worry for yourself. It’s wanting a cuddle with parents and family who aren’t close by and wondering if and when we’ll be together again. 
I would describe my emotions like a roller coaster. Having a young family helps as during the day life goes on and I can generally focus on them and I feel grateful that we’re getting extra time together. When they go to bed I seem to get a half an hour come down where my adrenaline kicks in and I process the days events. I’m trying to take extra care over my media use as my stress levels seem to increase when I read or watch too much news.
