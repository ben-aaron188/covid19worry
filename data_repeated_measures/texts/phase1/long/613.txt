I feel that the institutions of government and the media have quite likely put a lot of people in danger. The government has been woefully unprepared to deal with the situation and the media, for the most part has been unwilling to ask serious questions about this and put the required pressure on them to sort it. The fact that up until two weeks ago, the strategy was to be focused on 'herd immunity' has been completely memory holed and the shortage of protective equipment for NHS workers has been obfuscated by constant repetition of the phrase 'whatever it takes' to pliant journalists.
