I feel sad about the coronavirus situation. My wife lost her new job due to this and her old employer won’t take her back to furlough her so it’s a stressful time. I am lucky my job is secure and safe which eases the worry and anxiety a little bit but not much. I am also worried about my parents who are both high risk. We are all following government guidelines but it doesn’t make the worry any less. We are lucky we are young and healthy and so are taking advice to go out to buy basic essentials rather than taking online slots who are for the most vulnerable but it’s still an anxious time given that young and healthy people are dying from coronavirus.
