I feel very anxious as it’s an uncertain situation and not sure how long this will last or what future implications will be. I am scared and wonder how it will affect everyone. I think people aren’t taking this seriously but the government should put orders out rather than instructions as there are people that think they will be the only ones going out etc. but that isn’t the case. I don’t understand how people are thinking like that or why people are letting them go out etc. as I know that if I said something about going out or whatever that people would tell me to stay in and hold me accountable.
