Due to the measures that have been taken I feel less anxious than I did. I am a key worker and when I am at work I feel more worried and stressed than at home. 
I have faith that the government have taken the right steps to protect us and have taken a preventative approach, i am less convinced at the general public's abilities to do the right thing to prevent the spread of Covid19, it makes me quite cross to see the very simple rules breached. I am sad for the lives that have been lost and this propels me to make the right choices.
