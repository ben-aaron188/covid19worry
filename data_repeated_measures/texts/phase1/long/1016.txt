I feel worried about the virus, burnout about me getting it. My mother is undergoing chemotherapy and has been told no one knows if treatment will continue if nhs becomes overwhelmed. So I am worried most about her treatment ending  also, because of the chemotherapy her immune system is lower and it could really hurt her if she caught it. So at the moment I am just keeping up to date on numbers and nhs capacity and taking it one chemotherapy session at a time. Also, my partner has underlying health conditions and is self isolating in his house. I havent seen him for nearly a month and I am worried about when I will get to see him with all this going on
