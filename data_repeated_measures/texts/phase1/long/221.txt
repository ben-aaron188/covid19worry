I feel depressed and frustrated a lot. I am unhappy with the situation. I am not able to go out and its making me feel frustrated. The government has completely mishandled the situation. This angers me as I feel we could have completely avoided the lock down we are in. I am fearful for the health of myself and my family. I am also angry at people not taking the situation seriously enough and going out the house excessively or for longer periods of exercise than absolutely necessary. They will spread the disease more.
