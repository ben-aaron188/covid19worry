I'm annoyed at the people who are still going out to be social. I'm frustrated that the NHS has been so under funded, that the government for all they preach about helping the UK have done fuck all and it's mainly the NHS (Who they wanted to privatize) who are helping. I'm worried and stressed because of my family and friends in this situation, especially as I take care of my elderly dad. I'm fortunate to be able to work from home but I'm not in a great financial place, and honestly, just everything is horrible and some idiots don't seem to realize  they should stay inside for other people's sake.
