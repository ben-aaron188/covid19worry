I am feeling very nervous and anxious, not just at the current situation but at the fact of the unknown for the future of the individual people of the world, countries as a whole and even the world as a whole. When will the lockdown end? But what happens then? How do we go back to normal? What will normal be? Will it ever go back to how it was before this? Will we ever be able to move as freely in the world again? These are all unanswerable questions at the moment but the most worrying questions of all.
