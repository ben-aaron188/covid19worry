I feel quite sad as the measures taken to help stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected my family. My parents are not able to visit their grand-daughter (my daughter) and my wife and I may be unable to go on our planned 1st holiday with our child. I am moderately worried about my close family's health but my over-riding emotion is sadness at everything that has been and will be missed out on due to self-isolation measures. I am not fearful as my current employers have furloughed me but agreed to pay the remaining 20% of my wages so although I am technically not working at present I am still receiving full pay and can therefore spend more time with my wife and child. My wife is an NHS Key worker and as such is working a lot, I am moderately scared of her contracting the virus but I know it will not affect the 3 of us too much.
