I am quite concerned about the current situation in Spain cause my relatives live there. My father is a high risk person and I wish I could be there to help my parents going through this. I also feel a bit lonely and sad because I have a different kind of infectious disease at the moment and due to the social distancing policy I can't have any friends coming over to visit me. I hope the situation gets better as soon as possible and that this won't severely affect the economy of people around the world. However, I don't think this will end any soon. At least not until they discover some antibiotics or a vaccine that works against coronavirus.
