I am fed up. Mainly because I'm working from home at the minute so not seeing anyone during the week. I'm also lonely as family can't visit from overseas and all my social opportunities have been cancelled. I feel isolated and like rubbish generally because my routine is gone and every day is like the last. I keep having stressful dreams so my sleep is poor and overall I just feel on edge all the time from anxiety. Everything and everyone is strained and stressed and it's horrendous. I really can'twait to this is over. The worst thing about it is that noone has any idea of when that might be.
