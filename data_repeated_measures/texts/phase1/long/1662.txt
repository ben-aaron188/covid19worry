Having just read the news about Boris Johnson being taken into Intensive Care, I feel a huge sense of sadness that these may be the last hours of potentially the greatest PM in my lifetime. Genuinely hoping he pulls through, gets us through this dark time and does the business for Brexit, this Country needs a character and a leader like him at this time more than ever.
As stated, this is an incredibly dark and dystopian time for the Country and the World, I can only hope that when the dust has settled those culpable will be held to account, be it financially or criminally. This isn't a xenophobic statement either, people and Countries, no matter who they are need to be held accountable for the pain and suffering caused.
