The constant news cycle, featuring little confirmed information, is exhausting and frustrating. It feels like everything comes with an estimation or a guess, which fluctuates and causes uncertainty. In relation to that, not knowing when the pandemic will end, or when/if a cure will be found is anxiety inducing. But I would prefer to know less about this, until something is concrete. Whilst being inside for long periods of time can add to the symptoms of depression, I currently feel good about using this extra time to work on personal projects.
