I am angry because the United Kingdom government has not closed non-essential construction sites. My neighbour is having a house renovation and have not been asked to stop construction despite the noise on my mental health and the increased risk of Coronavirus through its spread from builder to builder. The government needs to close down non essential construction sites otherwise there will be more deaths and unnecessary lives will be loss. I am also scared for the mental and physical health of my already ill and disabled family due to the Coronavirus situation.
