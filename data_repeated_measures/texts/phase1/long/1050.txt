The entire Covid-19 situation hasn't really affected me much, personally. I'm used to having to stay inside so it really hasn't affected my daily schedule or living habits whatsoever. I also believe that the media are mis-representing the severity of the issue. Of course the issue is moderately severe but the actual death rate of Covid-19 is between 0.9% and 3%, which is nowhere near as bad as viral outbreaks in the past. The media should stop scare-mongering and instead provide the real facts and figures to the general populace - this would help keep people calm and rational as the Covid-19 crisis continues.
