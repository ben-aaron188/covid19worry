I feel like the UK government have not done enough soon enough. I think lockdown should be more strict and enforced at this point as it is clear that not everyone is following the rules. I think increased security measures would come at further detriment to peoples wellbeing and financial situations however I believe it is necessary at this point to prevent this awful virus killing more of our loved ones and putting a strain on the NHS. When lockdown was originally announced I felt incredibly anxious about the whole situation in a way I have never experienced before. As the days have went on I have grown accustomed to life now however sometimes I will have moments of realising how crazy and saddening it all is. I have personally been very worried about the mental wellbeing of everyone around me most of all friends and family that can't get out the house due to being high risk. Personally, I'm not that worried about catching the virus itself as I am taking every safety precaution I possibly can but it is rather the knock on effects the lockdown has had on my life that induced the anxiety such as having a drastic reduction in my income and the strain of being locked in the house with my family.
