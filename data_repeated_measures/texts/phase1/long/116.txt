I feel a lot of anxiety due to the fact both of my parents are essential workers and are risking their health every day. There is also a man from my church who is seriously ill and I'm praying that he recovers as he has a wife and child. There is so much uncertainty and there are so many people who still aren't taking this seriously so I think this is going to take forever to get over. I miss the freedom of being outside, I miss my friends and I genuinely believe that things are going to get so much worse before they can get better.
