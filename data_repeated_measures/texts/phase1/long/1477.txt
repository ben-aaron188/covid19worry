I feel like the corona situation is on its way to being fixed. Everyone should stay home to help the situation. It is hard but everyone can do it. Everyone just had to find stuff to entertain themselves. The important thing is that everyone can help by just staying inside. We have a long way to go yet but the signs are good that things will level out and then improve. I suspect we’ll be social distancing for at least another month. I do worry about the economy but I think the government and everyone is doing the best they can. It is an unseen event so everyone is having to figure it out together. There’s been a lot of businesses doing what they can to help people; all the free exercise videos and people offering to get food for people that can’t get out. I hope this continues and the NHS gets more funding because this has proven how vital it is to the UK and how it is under funded. It will undoubtedly have put strain on a lot of relationships and people’s mental health but everyone can help to make it easier. If people don’t follow the lockdown guidances it will just get worse and it will all go on longer than is needed
