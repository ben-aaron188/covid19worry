the corona situation is scary, but not just because of the virus itself. In fact thats the least scary part, although we are not 100% sure there are alot of facts that science can present to us about the virus, e.g; how it spread, symptoms, how people recover and feel afterwards. 

The main source of worry and anxiety and also anger is the government who are not doing enough in order to flatten the curve and keep as many people alive - e.g; under funding in nhs, not enough ppe. As well as that it is also the groups of people who either think that this is not an issue so still carry on with their normal lives going to work and meeting friends or believe it is some sort of conspiracy and so they also chose to ignore the governments advice.
