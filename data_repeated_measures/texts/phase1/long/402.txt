I am currently anxious about family living in different parts of the UK and abroad but thankful that I am able to work from home. Worried as I am classed as high risk due to underlying health issues. 

I am stressed that I am unable to get online groceries deliveries yet I am supposed to remain at home for 12 weeks due to being high risk, yet when I go to the supermarket, they are constantly sold out of essential items such as toilet roll and pasta. Panic buying is selfish and unnecessary and is detrimental to those of us who are unable to stock up for various reasons,  Social distancing is not being followed strictly enough in the UK compared to other countries such as Dubai.
