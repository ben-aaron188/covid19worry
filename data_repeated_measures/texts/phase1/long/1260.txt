Feeling very angry, as this situation should've been dealt with earlier to avoid where we're at now. I feel frustrated there's nothing I can do to fix it. I am scared of the loss of my routine and how it impacts my mental health. I feel very alone as I'm isolated on my own. I am angry I'm expected to continue ""working"" from home when this situation is destroying my mental health. I'm angry at how many people I see outside going for walks when i go to do my shopping. I am saddened by the deaths and more serious cases and feel they are directly caused by the actions of the prime minister.
