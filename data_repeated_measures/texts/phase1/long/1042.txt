Nationally, I'm disappointed in the relatively few selfish idiots that continue to flout or ignore the UK lock-down restrictions, but I also realise that this is more on me to adjust my expectations of society as a whole to reflect reality rather than be upset by it. I'm also disappointed by the daily government briefings, the lack of useful information they contain and how they have quickly descended into a political defensiveness. Mistakes have clearly been made, and will likely continue to be made. No one is expecting a perfect response in such difficult times, but it's saddening to realise that even in a crises such as this, politicians will still more willing to put self and party above country and personal integrity.
