The coronavirus is confusing. The news changes all the time about what's happening re: jobs, school etc. and it feels like this could go on for some time.
It's also stressful - it's difficult to find essentials in the supermarkets and staying indoors without the option to casually go somewhere else is difficult.
I worry about getting the virus, so in that sense I am happy to stay as far removed from others as possible, but I also can't wait to get our freedoms back. I feel resentment towards those flauting the rules, as they may be one of the reasons that the lockdown gets extende (or more strictly enforced).
