I’m annoyed at how some people are ignoring the government guidance but hopeful that something will change soon if the government act fast. I think the government should be harsher on the rules of the lockdown in order to contain this quickly and efficiently. I am agitated as I am bored at home and don’t have an income. I am fearful that things might go wrong and the country will not recover in the way it should do. I believe we are not doing as much as a country compared to other countries, who went into lockdown from the start and are starting to see cases drop.
