I am anxious about going out incase I catch it, I try to go out every couple of days, but find it difficult to relax when I am out.
Every day seems the same at the moment - there is no difference between weekdays and weekends. I try to keep to a regular routine going to bed at the same time eating meals at the same time with my Husband and son. I go into the garden a lot for a break from the family which helps a lot. I have planted some seeds and waiting for them to appear gives me a reason to go outside in the garden.
