I am anxious about what the future holds, and worried about family members becoming ill. I miss my family and friends and I find it difficult not knowing when I will see them again. I donâ€™t feel in control of the situation and I worry about how my job will change as I work in the NHS. I am trying to stay positive and take things day by day, and not reading too many news articles. I am at home with my young family and I am enjoying spending quality time with my husband and children.
I worry that the government may not have control of the situation and there will be many more deaths. I also am angry at people who are not talk n the situation seriously and endangering others.
