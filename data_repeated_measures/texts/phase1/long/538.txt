I feel that there is an underlying problem with the whole situation. Bill Gates had been warning of this on TED 15 years ago and we have had various contagions around the world. It seems that no country in the world was really ready for this, nor did they have any plans. It is as though it was never expected to happen. The testing in the UK for antigens is not working and a lot of taxpayers money has been spent on this. Emergency services are grossly overstretched and people are being badly informed. The only useful strategies have been hand washing, distancing from others and not going out unless necessary. Masks and gloves being worn day after day by the public may even accumulate the pathogen but no advice on this has been given.
