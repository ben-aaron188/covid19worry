I feel a bit of anger and frustration towards the governmentas I think initial  response could have been faster and better. 
I feel very  sad for people who have lost their lives or relatives and am slightly anxious about my parents. I think a lot of people will be financially worse off because of this and I wonder what the future of the country will be.  I feel sad and  helpless for people on low incomes and I think the wealth gap will widen.
I am mildly anxious for my own situation but not desperately so. Lockdown has on the whole been ok if a little frustrating.  It would be easier if an end date was known, though this is not possible.
