I’m extremely anxious about the situation that the world currently finds itself in. I am really struggling in my mind to come up with how things ever get back to normal with not only my life but everyone’s. It worries me that society may never be the same again. Even though the coronavirus hasn’t directly affected me or anyone that I know, it has dramatically changed our life’s for the worse. I’m very worried for my future. I am certainly more anxious about my future, my job, the economy etc than I am scared about my health during the pandemic.
