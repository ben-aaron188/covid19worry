I feel uncertain and stuck in limbo at present. I am not sure how arrangements around my current pregnancy will progress. I am working from home full time and I am aware that I am very lucky financially, but I am finding it difficult and stressful, particularly with a small child at home. We are thinking of moving in the fairly near future, but that is on hold for now which concerns me a bit. I enjoy food and cooking, and being more restricted in options there has irritated more than I expected it would.
