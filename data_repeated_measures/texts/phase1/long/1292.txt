It is a concern to me but I feel like our family is doing its best to keep itself safe, and the virus has not yet directly affected anyone particularly close to me, nor is it particularly widespread (or at least known to be) in my area. It seems like in several countries that a corner has been turned, and although we are a little behind in the UK, it is encouraging to see a light at the end of the tunnel. However, we are all feeling fairly stir-crazy having been stuck in our house for so long, especially as we are used to being very active and going out and about.
