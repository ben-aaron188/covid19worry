At this moment in time I feel extremely worried and angry about the Covid-19 pandemic. Plans I had made for the future have all gone and unlikely to occur again. Holidays cancelled, birthdays affected. I am very worried about the health and wellbeing of my family and friends who are all compromised due to underlying health conditions. People are not following the rules of social distancing and believing it's just the flu. Needlesly risking other people's lifes due to their own ignorance and stupidity. It has been difficult trying to get time off work in order to self isolate so as to protect my family. I'm lucky I work in a sector that can continue to provide a service during this time (therefore my job is safe) but they are making life difficult by not providing us with proper protection from Covid-19 other than wash your hands and here's some antibacterial wipes.
The economy is going to tank again just as I was starting to gain my feet from the last financial crisis in 2008 which hit a few months after I finished high school. Stronger sanctions should have been in place weeks before the where to try and minimise the disruption to the world. All travel from hotspots banned, people quarantined for 14 days, large gatherings cancelled sooner. Hopefully lessons will be learnt for next time. The only glimmer of light is that people are helping others in need. I hope this can continue long after this is over.
