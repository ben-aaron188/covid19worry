I am very anxious about contracting Covid-19 and passing this onto another person, in particular a vulnerable or elderly person.
I am not particularly worried about the effects of me catching the virus, but more of passing it onto a third party.

With regard to the economic effect of the virus, i think that this is going to be far-reaching and pretty devastating, which many have not yet appreciated. I am pretty fearful of this aspect of the virus.

I think that the virus has also brought out the good in a lot of people and has revived the community spirit and brought people together, which is a positive effect.
