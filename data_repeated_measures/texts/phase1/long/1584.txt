I feel very fearful for the future both short term and long term. In some ways I am also looking forward to the time when positive changes start to happen. But in the meantime, there is a lot of uncertainty and this concerns me. One positive is that I feel the Corona situation has forced everybody to slow down, to spend time nurturing new and old relationships and to evaluate what is most important to them. I feel terrible for the people badly affected and fear that they could happen to me or those close to me. I hope and pray for this to be as over as quickly as it started and wish that it was possible for clearly defined timescales so that we knew what we were faced with.
