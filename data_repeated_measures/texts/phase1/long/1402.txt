i'm worried not for myself but for the wellbeing of my close friends and family. not only that, but i am also feeling quite a bit lonely as well. the constant news showing how the death toll has hit a new peak worsens my anxiety. i feel a bit depressed being constantly in my house, but the recent warm weather and my ability to go into the garden and enjoy it has somewhat alleviated these negative feelings. i feel constantly bored and seem to always want to procrastinate tasks that are given to me.
