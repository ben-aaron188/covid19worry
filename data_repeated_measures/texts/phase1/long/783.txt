I go back and forth with my emotions. Sometimes I feel frustrated, upset, bored and gutted about people getting ill and dying, all big events cancelled, pressures that come with homeschooling. I feel upset I can't see family and friends and then I feel ok and think this is a good time to relax, be with the children, also get the house sorted as well as sorting out other bits,working from home and sorting bits out that have been left for a while and also most importantly keep safe and save our NHS.
