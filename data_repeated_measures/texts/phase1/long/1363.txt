Scared for my elderley parents and myself. Self isolating and following strict guidelines. Feel bit more positive than I did last week, watching the governments daily broadcasts makes things more understandable, hopefully staying home is having a big effect to win this battle. So thankfull to all keyworkers especially NHS staff who are putting their lives at risk to help us.....very much appreciated. We all need to do what it takes to save lives and help the NHS.... and maybe it will be over sooner than we thought.
