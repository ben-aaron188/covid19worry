I am calm but very concerned about the corona virus situation. It is a challenging and difficult time. For the past three weeks, I have been working at home. I only go out to buy essential needs. I strictly follow the government and health officials directives. My flatmates are doing same too.
At the moment, am not thinking about myself but the human race as a whole. Am still wondering how the world will look like after this pandemic. However, I have trust in the health officials and government.
