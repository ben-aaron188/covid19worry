I feel sadness at the number of people who have died and their families and friends left behind. It's very sad that these people can't be with their loved ones to say goodbye and can't hold a proper funeral to say goodbye.
Also I feel disgusted at how many people are flouting the rules about staying at home. The pictures of people shown in the press of people going on non-essential trips to shops, parks and beaches are terrible and could result in us going into total lockdown like Italy, Spain and other countries.
