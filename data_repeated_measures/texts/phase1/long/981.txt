I'm anxious for my family's health and the security of my role at work. I feel this virus or mutations thereof will become a regular occurance after this initial outbreak and change lives and how we live.
The social injustice and tax dodging/bailout requests/bullshit government response that is currently being correctly bought to light will sadly be brushed aside once again when people get back to 'normality'. Individual fear and selfishness will wipe out any meaningful change that would benefit society as a whole. I'd love to see research to check my theory that Leave voters are the same dickheads hoarding loo rolls and walking about coughing and hacking because freedom man no one tells them what to do brittania rules the waves...anywhoo.
