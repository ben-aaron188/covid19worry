I feel very anxious currently.  I have two small children (3 and 6) and an immunosuppressed husband so I'm very nervous that we might contract the virus. It could kill my husband who has many medical issues including asthma and my youngest child also has suspected asthma. Both myself and my husband have also been furloughed and the uncertainty of not knowing when we'll be getting back to normality is a worry for me. 
I'm also concerned about my eldest child and the fact that schools are closed, while we are getting her to do school work at home it isn't the same and she is missing out on her SATs exams.
