Watching too much news. Worry about loved ones. Fed up with social distancing. Absolutely believe the government is making it up as it goes along and have dragged their heels with response. Disappointed (very selfishly) at having to cancel plans. Sitting looking out my window every day. Need to exercise more but glad to still be able to get out for a walk every day. Eating far too much. Don't really have anything else to say as I can't think of any other feelings I am currently having in relation to the corona situation.
