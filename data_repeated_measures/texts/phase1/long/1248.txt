Honestly, the biggest thing I keep feeling is the desire to get back to normality. This situation has ruined my plans for the next year and it feels rather deflating. The time inside not having to work has been nice, but its just getting really repetitive and I honestly can't wait for it to be over! 

The time with friends in the house has been great. With finishing uni we've not seen each other properly for months, so that has been the shining light of this whole experience. We're just trying to make the most of what has been our final year, so I guess it isn't all bad. 

I'm very thankful that my family and friends are all well, so it's just a matter of waiting this out and getting life back on again!
