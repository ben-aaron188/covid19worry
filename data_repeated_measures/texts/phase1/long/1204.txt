Anxious about the future weeks to come, unsure about the outcome and how it will affect my job and the countries economy. I am hoping that lockdown will end soon and hope that everything goes back to normal very soon. Would like to say I am able to volunteer and help the NHS but I have no car. Waiting for the death statistics everyday and praying that they starting plateauing or declining very soon like Spain. Sad about everything being missed over summer and how my first year at university has been ruined and cut short. Extremely bored and hoping this ends soon. Praying that all my family and friends are safe and well, upset that I cant go and see them. Proud of the NHS!
