I think people should learn to follow the advice from our government and stay inside, people who keep going out for non urgent things, hanging around in crowds, heading to the beach are going to make the restrictions last longer as they are giving the virus somewhere to go, carrying it to other people flouting the advice given, they’re selfish only caring about their happiness in the now… they need to learn to consider other people and the future.

I understand being stuck inside sucks, but spreading the virus around to vulnerable people and killing off peoples loved ones by infecting them would suck a hell of a lot more.
