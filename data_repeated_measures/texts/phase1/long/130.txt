Frustrated at the lack of clear guidelines to follow and the lack of most peoples awareness of the problems. 
Relaxed in terms of current situation. Have enough of what I need not to have to worry or be concerned currently. 
Concerned about family members that could be the most at risk and the problems that them getting ill would cause.
Slightly helpless due to living at distance from family so being unable to help with anything if they need it. 
Grateful of the available technology so that I can keep in touch and be in contact with a lot of different people
