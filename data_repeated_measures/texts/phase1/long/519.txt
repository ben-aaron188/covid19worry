I feel worried and anxious about how this virus is going to come to an end. I am also thinking and worrying about my elderly in laws and parents and the fact that my husband and I can’t be with them not helping them at the moment. 
In other hand, I feel more and more the weight of privilege, right now, I’m not working but being paid my employer, I have a safe and nice house to be, with a bit of a garden when there are sunny days. I’m in a loving relationship so don’t have the worry of being abuse in my own home, I don’t have children to worry about nor to think about homeschooling, I have time to cook a healthy meal, I have money to do so, I have times and wifi for exercise, getting in touch with family and friends online. So I’m really grateful and privileged, how about poorer parts of the country and the world where there’s no space like shanty towns and favelas? This worries me a lot. 

But also hopeful and happy that perhaps this will bring about a new normal - where the rat race isn’t going to be so overrated as it was. So I’m always thinking about the both sides of the coin which makes me anxious and helpless. My main question is - how to help others in this situation?
