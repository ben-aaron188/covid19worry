I feel very sad and fear what will happen from day to day, I fear  I will lose my job, I am shaking inside and just want to cry all the time. I suffer from asthma so am worried about getting covid 19, also what will happen to the economy. I can't sleep and feel sick. I feel terribly sad that the nhs will have to decide who lives and who dies. I have considered asking my gp for some medication to calm me. I feel so tired it's like being trapped, with no way of getting out of the situation.
My colleagues are getting anxious and judging each other
