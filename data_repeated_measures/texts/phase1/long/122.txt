I am extremely anxious that me and my family do not get it, as a mother, I worry for the kids, as an asthmatic I worry about myself. I the majority of people are being fairly good, but I am angry at the people who didn't take it seriously early enough, including the government, and at the people who think they are the exceptions to the lockdown rules who put us all at risk. I am sad about how many people have died and suffered horribly, and those who are yet to go through this. I am worried that when lockdown is lifted people will just go back to how they were and now learn the lessons.
