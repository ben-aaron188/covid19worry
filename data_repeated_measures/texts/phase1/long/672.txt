I am anxious and curious about the situation to come. Mainly the effect on day to day life from the result of nationwide lockdown as well as the future availability and timeline of a vaccination program. I wonder how the economy will last throughout this situation and also when the problem is resolved. I also hope that this situation has made key issues be realised such as the need for the emergency services to be better funded, equipped and manned. 

I also hope that the country is able to maintain the required level of lockdown and social distancing to enable the lockdown to be lifted at the earliest possible opportunity.
