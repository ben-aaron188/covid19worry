It's a bit frustrating not being able to go outside as I normally would. But the current lockdown does allow some time outside to go to the shops and exercise, that's good for my mental and physical health.

I'm lucky that I work from home, so I can continue with my job as normal, although my income has dropped a bit.

We have to be patient and try and make the best of things. It's a good opportunity to spend time with family and catch up on things indoors that need doing. 

Hopefully the lockdown will start to show some positive effects on dealing with the virus.
