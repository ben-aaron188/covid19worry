I feel frightened about the effect that the virus is having and am worried about how this will impact people over the long-term. I am currently a full-time student and have been moved to remote learning so I am concerned that my academic performance may be affected. I am also concerned for the health and well being of family members and levels of access to essential services. I have a close relative who is awaiting an operation and it looks unlikely that they will be able to get this anytime soon with the current strain on the National Health Service.
