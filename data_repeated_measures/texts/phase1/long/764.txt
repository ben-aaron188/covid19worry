I feel that there is a lot of unknowns which is contributing to peopleâ€™s anxiety. I feel that the government are not in a position to answer many of these unknowns which is a contributing factor to anxieties. I am personally feeling very unmotivated in my day to day living. I feel it is difficult to maintain a routine with changes to work patterns etc which is having an impact on my mental health. I do not personally feel at high risk if I was the get coronavirus but I feel many people who are in the high risk category are being complacent in their daily actions which could result in them becoming seriously ill.
