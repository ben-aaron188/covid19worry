I feel anxious all the time to varying degrees, sometimes becoming fearful particularly when the news deteriorates. I am worried about my family, the country and what is going to happen. I am finding it difficult to sleep. I am trying not to watch too much news on TV or on my phone, as a means of trying to control my anxiety, however I am still very worried. I desperately hope that a vaccine can be found as I think this would be the most likely way out of the situation.  I am washing my hands a lot and am worried that the virus could be transmitted by packaging or via the post.
