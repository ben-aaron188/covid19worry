The corona situation has made me realise how unfair the system in the UK is. From cleaners and other small workers in stadiums having to take a pay cut whilst footballers earn much than their annual in one week, to NHS workers having a shortage of test kits for the staff as well as the general public yet celebrities are testing 24/7 as if it is nothing. The sense of priorities within this country is highly unethical as it does not care about the majority but rather than the happiness of an elite minority.
