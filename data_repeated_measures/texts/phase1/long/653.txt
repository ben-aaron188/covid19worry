my feelings are one of protectiveness towards my wife and anxiety that I will fail to shield her,  I have no fear for myself but worry about others.  I a, stress free though and most of the time can relax and distract myself working form home, gardening or walking my dog.  In fACT I HAVE SPOKEN MORE TO MY NEIGHBOURS THAN EVER BEFORE AND PEOPLE ARE DEELOPING A COMMUNIOTY BOND, A COHESION THAT WAS NOT THERE BEFORE..  I FELE MORE ATTACHED TO OTHERS AND MY COMMUNITY, BUT FEEL EMENSE SADNESS WHEN I SEE THE DAILY LOSS OF LIFE AND THE HARD WORK nhs STAFF AND OTHERS ARE DOING, I FEEL GRATITUDE AND ENDEBITIDNESS.
