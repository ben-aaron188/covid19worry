I feel if everyone obeys the rules we will get through this. However too many people are not so it will be ongoing for a while. The whole thing is very frightening and the slightest cough makes you wonder if you have caught it.

Being unable to see loved ones is hard but thanks to modern technology it has become bearable. When the crisis is over then serious questions must be asked of China, starting with why they sat on the epidemic so long before warning the rest of the world.
