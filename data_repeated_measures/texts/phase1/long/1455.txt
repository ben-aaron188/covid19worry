The Corona situation in the UK is very worrying.  Top politicians and dignitaries cannot escape this virus. Young people are dying as well as the elderly.  I am worried for the nurses who work in the NHS as I was an RGN years ago and cannot imagine how stressful it must be going to work without the proper equipment and protection.  In my lifetime there has never been a time such as this.  My elderly mother lives abroad and if anything happens to her I will not be able to fly out there and even if I could get a flight I would have to be in quarantine for two weeks.  This is very worrying.  I'm worried about my sister who is unable to get her drugs and I am worried for myself as I have asthma and other immuno-defieciences and well an auto-immune problem - SLE.  The internet seems to be a lot more unreliable and slow since the lock-down.  When going out for my daily excersise today I notice how careless people were.  I noticed one woman standing on the park path far away from her two children who were cycling in opposite directions to each other. A neighbour of mine was walking up the path and the woman made no attempt to move and there was only a couple of inches gap between them.  They didn't seem to mind or notice that they were breaching the social distancing rules.
