Constant feeling of worry for my family's safety as they are all key workers. As I'm not living with them I worry if I go a day without hearing from them.

Annoyed at the people who are flouting social distancing rules, especially if it results in daily exercise no longer being allowed for the rest of us who are following the rules. 

Trying to filter out the media that is trying to scaremonger, but daily death toll makes it hard to not take the threat to public safety seriously.
