I go from being accepting of the situation to very frightened.  Evidence suggests as a healthy 30-something I will in likelihood be ok, but then the news has terrible stories and I'm scared for myself, my family and children.

I have disabled elderly parents who live a 6h drive away, I do all I can to help them but I feel useless and anxious that if something happened I wouldn't be able to care for them.  They are vulnerable but don't fit into the top category for government assistance.  

The not knowing is more difficult, the lottery of if you got the virus, whether you would be ok and the unknown of when it will end and if life will ever be the same again
