I am not sure how I feel really.  The world has been turned upside down.  Plans cancelled.  The future is uncertain.  I am very aware my situation is much more secure than that of many people, so I don't feel I can dwell too much on the small aspects I am finding difficult.  There are uncertainties about my work in the medium- and long-term as a result of this I think, but my employer isn't communicating about this.  I have some worries for my health and that of the people I care about.  I am trying to 'stay safe'.  I am following directions given by the Government.  I feel frustrated that others aren't and that the Government have given confusing and inadequately firm instructions.
