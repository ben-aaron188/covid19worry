I'm not personally afraid for myself right now while I'm inside for 12 weeks. Stuff is feeling more predictable now, but I am afraid for friends and family who are keyworkers and don't have adequate PPE. As the deathtoll rises I'm finding myself more afraid for others in society too, sad at people risking their lives with out the equipment they need and not being paid enough. I'm disgusted and angry on their behalf, it feels unfair so much pressure is on them and some people don't even appreciate it.
