I feel scared. Partly for myself but more for my children who live closer to “hot spot” areas of the country. I also feel guilty that I’m not able to do more to help others and that I have a nice place to live where staying at home and staying isolated is relatively easy. I feel irritated with people who aren’t complying with advice and who don’t seem to know how long 2m is. I’m worried that there don’t seem to be sufficient tests available for key workers and that we don’t know enough about the virus and how safe we are
