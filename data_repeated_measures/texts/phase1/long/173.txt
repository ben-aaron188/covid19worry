I feel very anxious, not being able to do anything with my 2 children makes it that much worse. I feel stressed and I wish people would follow the guidelines, it is very frustrating. I am glad that none of my family have caught the virus so far but it is so scary that they could still possibly get it having to do daily things like walking their dogs, shopping for essentials etc. Although I am really angered and upset that I cannot visit any of my family due to the pandemic. It is very isolating and lonely having to stay in. I hope that this will end soon so we can go back to enjoying the world around us.
