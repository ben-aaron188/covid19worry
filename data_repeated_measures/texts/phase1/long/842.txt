Tired of being inside most of the time but making a routine and trying to get through it all. Looking forward to being able to socialise and band out with friends...whenever that is.  Feel sad for those who are passing too soon.  Feel proud to have the NHS but angry at the government for how shortsighted they have been given they’ve underfunded it and berated it but now want to applaud it.  Almost more worried about the US and how their government’s blind ignorance of science will affect their people.
