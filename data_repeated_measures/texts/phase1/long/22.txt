I am not worried about the effect of coronavirus on those that I love or myself. I am sad for all those who are suffering in all kinds of ways not just from coronavirus but also from the efforts being made to deal with it. I am also angry about the lack of resources and capabilities to deal with this pandemic

I am worried about how this pandemic will be brought to an end and the longer term impact of the pandemic on society, the ecomony and individuals. I for one will live my life differently as soon as I am able to.
