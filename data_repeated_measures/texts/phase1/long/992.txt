I am young and healthy so not too worried about myself just other more vulnerable people. Although reports of young people dying are becoming more common which is a concern. I feel I might get it since I work in a small supermarket where lots of people come in and out everyday. we are cleaning more and limiting the number of people but coronavirus is known to be more infectious than flu and many people are expected to get the illness. I feel quite anxious about the global situation and find it very sad that thousands of people are dying.
