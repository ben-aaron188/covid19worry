At this very moment, I feel anxious about friends and family who could be affected by COVID-19. My grandma and aunt are both in a care home which is under lock down, and I am concerned about them after hearing stories on the news. I am also worried about my friend who is in the 'severe risk' category due to an underlying condition. I am concerned for everyone who is struggling at the moment and am worried about the longer term effects on the economy. However, in my immediate family unit we are all fine, and not finding the lockdown too challenging. I feel a bit guilty that I am actually enjoying many aspects of being at home as a family, and taking time to slow down and appreciate the small things together.
