I feel quite low at times throughout the day, slightly anxious about the unknown and restricted and a little bit trapped although I’m fully aware it is all for the best and needed it does feel very lonely and I worry about when this will all be over and how different things will be when it all endS. I have some money worries about how Secure is my job.  It’s the worry of the unknown and whether you yourself will get it or a family member friend and could I too be a carrier and pass it on someone else that I care about
