Worried. We now have local cases in our rural area which is an island. They predict that our area will peak in maybe 2 weeks. There are only 4 respirators on our island for a population of 27000. I am working from home which I like as there is only a small amount of work I can actually do! My partner is on furlough for the foreseeable future and we are both in the 'vulnerable' group. Whilst we have a lot of supplies at home, we are unable to book any supermarket delivery slot (I'm disabled and this is how we usually do our shopping)
