As I'm self employed and work from home this situation hasn't impacted me financially or affected my day to day life.  I'm worried about my older family getting the virus and how badly it would effect them, also their mental health as they're not used to being on their own for any time at all.  Also I'm worried how the economy will be impacted as a result of the lockdown as well as this coinciding with brexit.  Overall I consider myself very lucky and I'm following government advice strictly to protect the people most at risk.
