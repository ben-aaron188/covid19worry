I am anxious for how this will continue to affect life in the future. I am fearful that loved ones might die. I am worried that our financial security will be affected. But, I am also cherishing the quality time I am getting to spend with my children, and I am quite enjoying home schooling them, in between home working. I miss my friends and family, and I miss going out for meals or to the beach. I love to travel, so I am sad that we are missing on our holiday, but it's worth it if we can help to stop the spread of the disease.
