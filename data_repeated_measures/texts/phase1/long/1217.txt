On the one hand I feel fortunate that I have not been affected financially in a negative way, I do not need to leave the house unless I want to, have a garden where I can get fresh air, sunshine and exercise, have enough food for a few weeks, and am finding plenty of things to do to keep occupied.  I am also in frequent contact with a good number of people by phone/email/text.

As a range of things I usually do regularly(such as choir, art class, etc) and future plans (such as holiday and visit to family) were cancelled I have felt disappointment, but overall accept this.

I am feeling worried on behalf of other people whose health is more vulnerable than mine, a sense of uncertainty about how long this situation will persist and concern for people I know who are 'key workers'.
