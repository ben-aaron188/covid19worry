I am frustrated that people are not following the advice from the government and staying indoors, there’s people that are currently out abusing the opportunity of going out for one form of exercise and going on bike rides as if it was a normal summers day and if they aren’t going to follow the rules then the government will have no other option but to punish the rest of the population for the sake of keeping the morons inside, I think there should be heftier fines in place to further discourage people disobeying the restrictions in place and current restrictions need to be enforced more harshly
