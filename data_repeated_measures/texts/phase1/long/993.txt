Currently, I feel anxious that the situation in the UK will not improve due to people flouting the lockdown rules. However, this period has been, so far, a time of rejuvenation and therefore there have been happy moments at home. I have also seen the emergence of a greater community spirit in my area. There is also a great sadness for the lives that have been already lost, especially health workers who are putting their lives on the line to help others survive. I hope that people, especially the government, will recognise this after the corona virus.
