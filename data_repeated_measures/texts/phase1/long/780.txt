I am very worried about catching Coronavirus. Having heard about the Prime Minister's condition just now has made it even more frightening that it can attack anyone.  I am also worried about my family catching it as they are elderly and in the vulnerable group. I am trying to only go out shopping once a week to keep myself safe. I am also shopping for family members to ensure they have everything they need during this difficult time as they have been advised to stay indoors for at least 12 weeks.
