I feel quite sad for the state of the world and generally very anxious about my personal situation. I am a student now without tuition but still with the expectation from my uni of doing my work, which I find myself unable to do. I have formally diagnosed mental health issues that are currently being exacerbated. The fact that I have my flatmates still with me is helpful in many regards and provides some comfort during the social distancing. I have been fearful for the health of my family - my older brother is immunosuppressed and my mother has had pneumonia twice - but at the moment I know that they are safe due to their strict adherence to social distancing and the fact that they live in a semi-rural area away from many other people.
