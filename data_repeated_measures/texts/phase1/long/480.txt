I feel helpless.  I feel that no one has the answer to this problem at the moment and am not sure when the solution will be found. Will it be effective? Will I  feel safe sending my kids to school in future? There is so much sadness. A kid dying and not being able to have his near and dear ones with him. It is heart-breaking. I am hoping an effective and safe vaccine can be found quickly and like other diseases like polio, Tuberculosis, measles etc., human kind will conquer it. It feels like the government has no strategy or answers yet. Even the prime minister has been hit by the virus and we as a nation appear to have insufficient resources. How can we be a developed nation and not have basic equipments needed by healthcare professionals.
