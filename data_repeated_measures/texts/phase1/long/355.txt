I’m very stressed every single day, much more than I’m usually stressing at work. I’m scared of tomorrow...about my siblings, friends, colleagues and our future. I never been so disappointed and tired of media. We all waiting for updates to bring us back to normal routine to start having plans and ideas of what next...currently our life is on pause. I’m tired of staying home for the third week and seeing people outside who just ignore social distancing and keep living their normal life’s like nothing  happens.
