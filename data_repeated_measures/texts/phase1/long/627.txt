I am anxious but becoming a little bit indifferent. I am more worried about impact on economy and my personal finances than anything else. Perhaps I am also uneasy about the fact that I cannot travel and might not be able to do it in the future. All in all, the situation is far from perfect but I try not to panic. I take every day as it comes and try to keep myself busy with work and exercises not to go crazy and not to waste too much time. I feel happy that I can spend time with my family and that we are having a good time together.
