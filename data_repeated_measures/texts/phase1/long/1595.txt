feel like people do not realise the magnitude of what staying in can do to help slow down the rate of cases. the government have put in measures but they arent that serious in comparison to other countries such as Germany who are taking it much more seriously. my grandma has recently been diagnosed with the cvoid-19 and she has only has contact with a few carers who come to her house to look after her. this has made me a lot more anxious about how cvoid-19 can affect the people in your family who you didn't think could get it that easily.
