It has caused me anxiety and sadness, as I'm unable to see my partner, family and friends being that we are on lockdown. I'm also worried about my dad catching it, as he is high risk with having lung problems and poor health anyway. I worry too about the effect on our mental health and economy, many people are losing their jobs and small businesses will be affected too. Thankfully my job isn't affected as I am a key worker but my friends work in retail and hospitality and they have been unable to work because of it. It is also a strain on our NHS, which has not been funded properly for years
