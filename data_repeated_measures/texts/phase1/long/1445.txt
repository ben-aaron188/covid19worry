I am not too concerned, however I have not had to go out much recently. My life (apart from work) is mostly the same as normal anyways, though i know that lots of people are struggling with staying in. 

 I am slightly annoyed at people still going out more than they should and in groups.

I am mostly relaxed as I am working from home, and I can do this easily.

I am concerned about my job and whether I will have to furlough. Furloughing is better than not having a job at all, but losing 20% of my income by taking furlough would make a huge decrease in my wage.

Other than that, I'm feeling the same as normal
