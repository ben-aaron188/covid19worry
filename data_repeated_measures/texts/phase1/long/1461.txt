Not fearful of the disease. Iâ€™ve had some of the symptoms. Angry with government response or lack of it. Way too complacent about the threat. More concerned about their careers than helping people. Annoyed at lack of Ppe for nhs and care staff, And annoyed at dismal state that NHS was in to meet this threat. Full of admiration for NHS and care staff. Believe strongly that we cannot go back to how things were. 

As someone who had symptoms- shortness of breath and fatigue etc I found being in fresh air very helpful. Think there should be policing of open areas but not widespread closures of parks etc.
