I'm worried for my personal well-being and mental health. I am a self employed performer, so currently have no in-comings. I am thankful that my partner is still able to work (from home) but it is difficult as we have two small children, so i am anxious that my youngest (8 months) may be socially behind with her development.

I'm concerned for the whole economy and how it is going to cope.

I'm frustrated at being stuck in the house with said small children (eldest 3) who don't really understand whats going on, and i'm annoyed when i see people using the park equipment, which we shouldn't be using.

i fear for how long this whole thing may last, and i'm dissapointed that so many great things have had to be cancelled that i was looking forward to, concert tickets, holidays etc.

i'm unsure about when its all going to end and we will start to get back on our feet.

and finally

I'm grateful and thankful for all the keyworkers on the frontline, putting themselves and their families at risk to try and salvage what little is left of normalcy.
