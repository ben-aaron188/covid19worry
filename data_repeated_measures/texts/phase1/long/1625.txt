I feel safe in our family bubble, finding joy in the little moments with my children and this time we have together but I miss my wider family and friends and worry about them all. I worry about money and my out jobs and what’s going to happen after. I worry about how my children will be affected by this.   I feel sad that things will never be the same again. My gran is 87 and I worry so much about her, I mean we were worried anyway because she has heart failure. Every time we travel up to visit I wonder if it’s the last time and now we have to stay away. It feels like we are collectively grieving, the things we have had to cancel and the life we once had. We have been saving for a deposit for a house but will probably need to spend our savings to keep us financially afloat if my husband gets furloughed. My business is not running just now as I work in the wedding industry. That being said I am enjoying spending time with my children and my husband at home together. We are lucky to have not long moved to a bigger house with a huge garden surrounded by fields and we are still able to get outside and enjoy the fresh air. We have done lots of things together we otherwise wouldn’t have time for and I think they are enjoying that too. They miss their friends but at the moment it’s not too hard on them. They are worried about getting sick too but I think it’s easier to put it to the back of our minds in our little bubble. I think about the people who are in less fortunate situations who are struggling to be stuck inside. I feel cross at people not taking it seriously enough and not adhering to the rules.
