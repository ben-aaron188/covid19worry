Most frequently I feel anxious regarding the possibility of catching the virus and the financial implications of lockdown. However, I recently got married so I am trying to remain positive and enjoy being able to spend time with my wife. I feel like if we hadn’t had our wedding or been able to spend time with all of our relatives before we were locked in then I would feel far more upset about it. We got an opportunity that others who had weddings booked not long after ours didn’t and we are grateful for that. Our honeymoon was cancelled however as my parents were asked to self quarantine after displaying symptoms and therefore unable to care for my elderly grandpa and younger sister in university, I was glad we were here and able to help our family. Our situation isn’t ideal but we appreciate that we have a lot to be thankful for in spite of this.
