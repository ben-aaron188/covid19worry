I feel anxious about protecting our family both from the virus and tbe effects of lockdown. Even when I think I'm not so anxious, I have weird dreams. I feel I am not doing enough to help out. I feel uneasy about contradictory information and not knowing how long this will last. Selfishly, I would like to go on a UK holiday we have booked in the summer. This won't happen if we are not allowed.
I feel cooped up and was only just starting to recover from a period of depression and anxiety and this has sent my anxiety through the roof. I am not normally an anxious person.
