I am worried about myself or my friends and family catching coronavirus. I fear that there will be repercussions after the curve is flattened. I think the economy will suffer after the coronavirus crisis. Many jobs will be lost and many businesses will have to be bailed out. I am currently looking for a job, it is already hard to find one and I think it will be even harder to find one after the coronavirus crisis is over. I feel like the government did not react fast enough to coronavirus and they have let the population down and put us in further danger. The government is starting to put the blame on coronavirus deaths down to the actions of the general public, yet the health service does not have adequate resources to fight the virus.
