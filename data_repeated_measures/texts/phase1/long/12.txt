I am 65 but have not left the house for 3 weeks apart from a walk.   I am finding the whole thing frightening and scary,  as what will happen when we are all allowed out of lockdown,  will it still be around and am I likely to catch it.  Now Boris Johnson is very poorly it has made me very jittery poor man,  brings home how anybody can be affected and he was saying eariler he had only mild symptons yet a week later he is in ICU.   I wake up in the mornings and realise this is not all a dream just the reality of 2020 I just hope me and my family get through this.
