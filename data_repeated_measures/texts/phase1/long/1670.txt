I am mostly saddened by the scale of disruption this is causing to people's lives. It upsets me that so many people are losing their loved ones but as I have not been directly affected I don't have feelings of anger. Where I can I am trying to remain positive and support those around me. I try to get my exercise each day to ensure I stay healthy and being active takes my mind off things. I do still try to keep up to date with the news to see when we may be getting to the other side of the curve.
