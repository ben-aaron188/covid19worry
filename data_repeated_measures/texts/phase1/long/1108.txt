I feel really worried about it and family and friends being affected by it I feel really sad that people aren’t sticking to the rules I have and have been staying at home which has made me feel a little more relaxed but I get stressed thinking about what is going to happen and how it is going to end. I take the dog for a walk in the morning and when I’m out I feel really nervous and also feel like I have picked up lots of germs and it makes me feel worried I also worry the dog might get something as it’s unsure whether animals can get it. I feel quite secure that I have the nhs and proud for all the hard work they are doing
