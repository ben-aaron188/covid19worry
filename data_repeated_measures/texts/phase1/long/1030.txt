I feel stressed that I would catch the virus as I would be affected quite heavily due to my health. I worry about the elderly people around that are more prone to death and heavy illness from it. The strain of virus doesn't have a cure at the moment and it is very scary and stressful for care workers like myself as there are many older people in my organisation that would get very ill from the corona virus. I wish that more could be done about it and more people took notice of the quarantine as it will just cause a longer lockdown.
