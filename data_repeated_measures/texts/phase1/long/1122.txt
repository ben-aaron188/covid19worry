I’m scared someone in my family home will get the virus and end up severely ill in hospital. I’m constantly worried that if any of us go into hospital they may die alone. This worries me more with my two children. I’m being eaten up with anxiety at the thought of them being scared and without their mum or dad to make them feel better. I’m paralysed with fear that there may not be life support equipment for any of us should we need it. I’m concerned that if any of us get the Corona virus it’s missed as being severe enough to go to hospital and we die at home in pain. I am doing my best to keep my family away from other people so we can stay as healthy as possible
