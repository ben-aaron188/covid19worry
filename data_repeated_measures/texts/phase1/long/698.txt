The corona situation is very worrying. Personally I have underlying medical conditions which puts me at greater risk. I am however a key worker and while can work from home to some extent, my risks are increased by my job. As such my anxiety is high whenever I am forced to leave home for work. I believe a vaccine is months away and will have to live with this fear for a long time. See8ng all the deaths on tv is very upsetting so I try to avoid the news as muc( as possible. Seeing idiots ignoring the guidelines is also a source of extreme frustration.
