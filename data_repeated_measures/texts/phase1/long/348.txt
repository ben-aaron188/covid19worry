I am very angry at the moment because people are not listening to the rules, for instance do not congregate, do not meet family and friends, stand 2 meters away from each other.  I am so angry because if people do not comply then this virus will take forever to be cured.  My neighbours are complete lunatics, they are having parties, load music, walking around as if nothing has happened.  I am fuming, I won't to report them, but I cannot as they live next door and I don't want any trouble.  Also I go out for a walk in the fields near where I live as I have diabetes and I do not have a clue how my sugar levels are and I would guarantee some uneducated peasant will be walking directly at me which makes me so angry
