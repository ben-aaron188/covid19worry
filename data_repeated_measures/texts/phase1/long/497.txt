I think lockdown should of been earlier.I also feel very angry because you still see people doing there own thing walking together in large groups, going to the corner shop about 4 times a day, it’s like people haven’t got common sense. I think it should be more strict about the lockdown. We should of took more precautions from the start. Greedy people at the supermarkets going crazy and not thinking about others. Starting arguments with the staff Who are putting themselves at risk so everyone can eat.
