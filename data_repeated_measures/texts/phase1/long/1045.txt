As a healthcare worker I feel very anxious about the situation, mainly the risk of bringing the virus home to my family but also the lack of PPE and the uncertainty at this time. I am also embarrassed of our country that they are unable to stick to the rules of social distancing. This makes me angry and upset as I donâ€™t think people understand the severity of the virus at all and think they are invincible. I am naturally worried about my family who I miss massively and am struggling from a social point of view. I do however feel that a lot of positives will come from this experience,
