That's a harder question to answer than it seems, because the more I think about the situation, the harder it is getting to deal with. I'm at a higher anxiety level than [the current] normal as I have just finished the food shopping. Fear is contagious too. Uncertainty about the future and to what extent and severity of the fall out. Mainly, I feel deceived, even weeks on and we still have no clear idea on numbers of deaths/infections. Also doubt, that all my loved ones will be safe at the end of this, I am already bracing myself for awful news.
