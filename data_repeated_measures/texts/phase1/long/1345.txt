I am anxious about not knowing when I will able to see my family and friends next especially as its getting boring having been in the house all the time. Moreover, I am frustrated that having invested emotionally and financially into going into the travel industry just before the virus struck its going to be a long time before I see any sort of benefits materialise. Furthermore, I miss watching sport a great deal as its a release from the norm of life and so cannot wait for that to return which will mean hopefully normality is on its way as well.
