I am very worried about the corona virus in particular for my 87 year old mom  son who has immune deficiency due to chemo last year future daughter in law who is a nurse and my daughter who is still working and taking 999 calls. My anxiety levels are very high and am waking up early and working harder to try and take my mind off it. I feel great sadness and have cried at the death toll . One of my sons friend dad who has cancer has died from the corona virus and a local teacher. I just wish things could go back to normal.
