I feel worried about going to work, I work in a supermarket and doing 2 oclock in the morning shifts so it is really hard. I am worried what the next few months holds for the country. I have already moved departments in my job, I am worried my family get it especially the older generation in my family and the health implications. I am worried about finances and for someone like me who goes to university and works the long term impacts. I worry whether I will be stopped by the police on the way to work early hours in the morning. There is also the worry about my holiday booked for June I do not want to go but the travel company will not cancel without charging a high cancellation fee.
