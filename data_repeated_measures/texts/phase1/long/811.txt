I am appreciating all the time at home with my children and husband, but I am extremely concerned about having to shut my business for the forseeable future. The unknown is the most frustrating part - how and when will we be able to reopen? Will we stay afloat? Will we get the financial help we need? The anxiety is constantly at the back of my mind. The actual prospect of getting ill is less worrying - we are self isolating bar a daily walk and shopping once a week. I would hope we are strong enough to fight it off if we do catch it.
