I am worried as I am on the vulnerable list and my husband is a key worker so he is in and out and he and I feel the risk is high for me catching the virus. Anxious before he gets home. So I feel tense most weekdays, sad as we socially distance, missing a hug.
Frightened as a friends cousin died.
I am feeling happy as I can keep safe though and also because I am loved and supported.
I feel satisfied as I am doing the best I can to support others while they are anxious and or stressed with the fear of catching this  horrid diease.
