I feel very strange about it all.  One minute I am ok and can block it out of my mind but then the reality kicks back in. I went to the supermarket today and felt very anxious. I feel at this moment as if life will never be the same again and that we are stuck in this time freeze forever.  It is the most surreal thing I have ever encountered. I am getting that I don't even know what day it is and have to force myself to recollect what's happening from one day to the next. I keep wanting to look at the news on tv and then when I do I want to switch it off again as it is so depressing.
