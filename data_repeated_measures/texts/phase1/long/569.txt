The situation is not really impacting my life, I already work from home, and my job is not high risk to loose. It’s a little bizarre not having our normal freedoms, but it simply presents new challenges for day to day life. This is a strange time to be alive. It’s a good excuse to get on with diy jobs around the house. Not being able to go out to the pub is also a little depressing. Other than that, things are pretty much plodding along as usual, well as usual as being locked down can be. The news continues on its strange course.
