I am quite anxious about the current situation and watching the news makes me sad and nervous. I am hoping the situation will get better over the coming months, it is a scary time and I am looking forward to getting through this and seeing friends and family again. I hate being bombarded by news 24/7 as there is nothing good being reported. I am sad that I can't see my family as often as I was before this happened - it is making me really lonely and I feel disconnected from everything. I miss socialising and having days out with meals out , trips to the cinema and being on public transport.
