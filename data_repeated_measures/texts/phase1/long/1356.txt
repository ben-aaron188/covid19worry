I feel scared, and worried. I am afraid for my health, and for my loved ones. I am afraid of how this impacts my job (I’m a lecturer and having to deliver classes online). I am afraid the government aren’t telling us to do the right things, especially now BJ us in ICU. I am worried about the economy. I am bored out of my mind stuck at home, and concerned about mine and my partner’s mental health. I am grateful we have a reasonably big house, and a big garden, and also for our little cat who is a great wee chum, and a nice distraction.
