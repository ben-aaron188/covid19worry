This is a very scary time. The unknown and the virus scare me the same amount. I do feel like I am always anxious and my head spinning with multiple questions... 
will I get it? 
Will my family get it? 
How long will it last? 
Will my job be safe? 
How will my mental health cope with very limited outside time? 
How much Will the economy suffer? 
Will there be a recession after? 


I think the government are now doing a better job but they still have to test more and that would help my anxiety.
