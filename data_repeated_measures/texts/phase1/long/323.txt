The situation makes me feel very anxious. Anxious for the world, how will it ever get back to normal after this? It makes me feel so sad that people can’t see their friends or family. We all miss each other so much. I know it is for the best and of course We will stay inside to try and help the NHS and to save lives. It just frightens me how bad it’s going to get. The numbers keep increasing, are we at the peak? Is it going to get worse? Are we anywhere near the end? We all miss our family, we all miss our friends. I actually miss going to work! It’s such a huge change for everyone, it’s a massive change
