Personally, I am fine, I am healthy with no underlying conditions and am working from home. The personal impact on me is that I've had to cancel several holidays and social activities I had planned. My day to day life hasn't been really affected. The only people I am concerned about is my elderly father but I spoke to him yesterday and he is currently fine.

I've been affected by having to go food shopping less often and it taking longer because I have to queue and go to several shops.

I'm anxious about how long this lockdown is going to be, I know we need to do it but I am not particularly enjoying not being able to go out. I feel the government aren't doing very well at managing this given many nurses have said they have no PPE and the govt initially ignored offers for help from some companies
