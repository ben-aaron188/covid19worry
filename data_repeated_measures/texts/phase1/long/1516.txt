I feel very sad that there is so many people not taking this serious and still heading out to parks and beaches. I’m also sad that I can’t visit my family but I am so thankful for modern technologies that allow us all to keep in touch. My children would be upset at not seeing their aunts uncles grandparents and friends if it wasn’t for technology. 
We have found new ways to connect as a household too so we are all trying to find the positives in this anxious situation. We are playing scrabble and doing plenty of outdoor games in the garden. It’s nice talking to my children about other stuff rather than letting the usual downsides of working and travel and school get in the way.
