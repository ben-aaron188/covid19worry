I am worried my job might be at risk. My mum is in the high risk category and that worries me lots as her breathing is always bad. I think about what if this doesnt go away and covid 19 becomes the normal flu. im bored in doors and so are the kids. The kids want to go out with their friends, they dont seem to understand the seriousness right now. seeing other countries have higher deaths on the news everyday makes me worried the UK might go that way. my family is lonely right now, cant wait to get back to normal.
