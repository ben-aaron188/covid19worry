I feel very concerned about people I'm close to getting the virus. I also feel concerned for the economy and what this means for people's livelihoods. I feel very concerned about what the world will look like when we get out the other side and how long it may take to get back to normality. I worry about the impact of lock down on people mental health and relationships with those in their households. I also feel some hope because it's been great to see the impact the virus has had on the sense of community
