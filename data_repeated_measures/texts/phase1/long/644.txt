It all feels very encompassing; you can't get away from it. If it's not on the news, family and work colleagues are talking about it, or it's all over social media. I am lucky that I am able to work from home, and thus I am continuing to be paid - I feel so sorry for those who do not have the same security at the moment. I am lucky also, in another respect that I still live at home, however, being cooped up with 4 other family members - one who has major depression and CPTSD - is tougher than usual (I rely on going to work to give me a mental break/respite usually) and thus I am finding I am not as patient as usual. I am however, taking time to rediscover old hobbies and these are really helping calm and focus my mind.
