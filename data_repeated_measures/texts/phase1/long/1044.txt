Though I am worried about the next few weeks in which I believe the virus will begin to peak in the UK, I am enjoying working from home considerably. The relative peace and quiet in my home environment is a stark contrast to my office and I feel that I can get far more done. As such, I'm completing tasks far more quickly and effectively and have feel less lethargic after a day of work.
