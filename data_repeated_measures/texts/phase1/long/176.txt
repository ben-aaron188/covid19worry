I am very concerned as I work in a vulnerable care home and suffer from an underlining illness which could cause lots of health issues and could end up in the result of deaths. The way the public are treating this is beyond a joke, they need to understand that the longer they disobey the guidelines set out the more people will suffer and die. If these people were too see the suffering that is occurring by people with covid 19 and how bad they are struggling and how close they are to death they would change their tune and start listening to what they have been instructed.
