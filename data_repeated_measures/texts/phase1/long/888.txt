I feel very fortunate at the moment. My company has gone out of it's way to allow everyone to work from home (which is something I've wanted to be able to do for years) and after a few hairy days I've been able to find everything I need in the shops. 

I don't know anyone who's been seriously sick and I've been restricting myself to checking the news once a day. 

All my social engagements have been cancelled but that's been great for me, I was dreading a couple of them. I've been able to keep in touch with people via Zoom and Houseparty.
