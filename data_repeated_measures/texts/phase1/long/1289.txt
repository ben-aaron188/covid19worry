The most difficult thing about this situation is the uncertainty and being such a dynamic scenario there is little reassurance any can give about the future. I already had physical health, mental health and financial difficulties before this began so I am anxious about how the Coronavirus will impact my recovery from those pre-existing issues. I am not the only person in this situation. Many are still trying to get back on track from the recession that is now over a decade ago and my anger relates to the failure of the UK government and others to support those who have lost so much since 2007 and now have this to deal with as well.
