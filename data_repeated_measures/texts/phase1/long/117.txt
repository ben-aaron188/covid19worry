I am extremely anxious and worried about the current situation as I am separated from my son and daughter.  I don't know when I will next see them, this causes me great distress. I have daily conversations with my daughter, normally I can reassure her but this is something where I am totally out of my depth.  Trying to be positive when I don't know myself how this will end.  I feel sad when I hear the news and I struggle to concentrate on anything. I am continuing to work from home but not sure how long I will be employed for as I only started the job last month.  I am extremely worried how we will all go back to normal life without catching the virus.
