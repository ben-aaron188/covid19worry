I feel very fearful about the corona virus, but it's also important to work at being happy and not allow the fear to overcome us. We take good care to do all the things that will help us stay safe, and we are really lucky to live in a rural area where we can enjoy the outdoors immediately from our house. Feeling happy is the strongest way to face adversity, and not allow it to affect us in a negative way. I am worried about what happens next, but doing our best to live for today and enjoy today. What is happening to others is never far from our minds though, so we think of everyone each day.
