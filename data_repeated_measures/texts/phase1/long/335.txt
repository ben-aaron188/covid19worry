I feel a little anger at the government who I feel are not always using logic and common sense in their approach to dealing with the covid 19 situation. My main worry is for how the long term impact of the situation will effect my ability to live my ""old life"", and effectively plan for the future. I feel fear that the economic impact will leave so many people unemployed and helpless. I feel some relief that my elderly mum with Alzheimer's died just before the coruna virus started because it would have been incredibly hard to maintain her care with all the restrictions in place. I'm worried still about protecting my dad who had cancer. My strongest emotion is sadness, at how many people will suffer long term consequences in terms of health, mental well-being, and financial capacity.
