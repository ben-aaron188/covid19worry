I feel anxious, I feel scared about the effect this could have on my family and the people close to me and the vulnerable people I look after at work in a care home. I feel unsure about how long this will go on for and how bad it will get, I feel frustrated at the people not taking it seriously and social distancing themselves and I feel frustrated at the insufficient protection, support and funding the NHS and healthcare professionals are receiving from the government. I feel sad that I can't see my boyfriend or my friends.
