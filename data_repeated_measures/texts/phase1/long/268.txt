If anything, I find the current situation very frustrating. I can cope no problem with the lock down situation but now and again I need small things which normally would be a quick visit to the shops but that is not as easy now. Buying online is an option but when you want something now it is not really an option.  We need to stock up on a few supplies but feel a bit anxious with regard to going to the shops and online options are limited as delivery slots are not available. In general I am quite happy as I am attempting to grow some produce at home for the future. If anything, Covid 19 is a bit of a wake up call.
