I think it is largely overblown. While it is a highly infectious virus and has bought forth fatalities, I fail to see why it is being treated so seriously. I think the reaction from the public and government officials is too much, for something that will likely disappear in 3-4 months by itself. Thus, I'm quite relaxed about it, but for the most part simply don't care. Of course, I could be proven wrong in the future, but based on the statistics currently available, I don't think it is that series for me. For the elderly however, or those with pre-existing conditions, it is of course much more likely to lead to fatality, and for them I recommend staying at home until this crisis is over.
