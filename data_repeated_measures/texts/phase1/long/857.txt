I feel anxious about the future, I don't know what's going to happen in next few months and how the economy and society will start living again. Nervous about holiday and trips which were one of the things that helped me relax and de-stress.
I'm nervous about passing people on the street or not wearing a mask on street. It is also unclear if the UK government is doing enough, as it introduced the measures really late. I feel I have no control over future and that nothing will be the same anymore after everything is over.
