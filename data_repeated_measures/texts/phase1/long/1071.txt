I feel worried for my friends and family and sad that I can't see them. I feel bad because I don't feel like I can be there for anyone properly. I feel anxious about the future. I feel guilty because I am glad I don't have to go anywhere or do much because I am depressed and this plays into my depression. I don't really care if I get ill. I'm getting very stressed thinking about this because I had just put it out of my mind. I feel inadequate, angry that I can't stay at home like other people because I work in the civil service and am classed as a key worker even though I don't feel like I do enough.
