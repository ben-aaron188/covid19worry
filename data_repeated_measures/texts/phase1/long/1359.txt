I feel that the gov under Johnson took the opportunity presented 2 do social Darwinism. its not a mystery. the nhs r being fantastic naturally, but it is a travesty that the evil Johnson is being kept alive by an NHS respirator. Johnson has no shame, & his cabinet of freaks cannot wait 2 kill anyone that needs anything. The impact 2 his enemies of killing them will have results they cannot anticipate, as people feel the rage, directing their anger @ Bojo the clown. I love the way that Social Services have got off my case.
