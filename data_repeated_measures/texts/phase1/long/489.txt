Very worried about how much the situation will worsen and how to keep my loved ones safe. 

Angry about the number of people still failing to take it seriously and endangering others.

 Anxious about how to keep my little one safe and entertained whilst isolated.

 Anxious about my own job prospects and sad about not seeing the wider family regularly.

Sad for those in less fortunate positions who cannot stay safe, have no one and have lost their jobs.
 
Proud of the response of the government and nhs workers.
