The situation has put many things on hold and disrupted/disrupting many people's lives including mine. People are taken away from their daily routine, much needed and carefully planned holidays are on hold or canceled, couples looking to move in together have to put their plans on hold, people looking to buy houses or move jobs have to postpone it, families are separated. Older family members don't want their kids to visit them for fear of getting infected, younger people choose painfully not to visit their parents for the same reason. 

At the same time, this unprecedented break has given people the chance to do all the things they never had time to do like finishing a book, catching up with friends on different time zones and generally slowing down what once was a very busy pace of life.

All in all although there are some pros, I feel the situation has made me really anxious with many uncertainty.
