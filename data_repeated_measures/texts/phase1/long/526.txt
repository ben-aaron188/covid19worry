very worried about my family health, especially my children. I still have to go to work and face numerous customers face to face daily in an office and it worries me sick I could bring it home and pass to my children. I have just seen that Boris Johnson is now in intensive care which makes you think if he can be in this position than anybody can end up in this condition. I am losing sleep each night , waking up worried , I suffered my first anxiety attack of my life as I am constantly on edge. Also worry about my childrens mental health being stuck in the house for so long and I take them out very early in the morning for a walk in the hope that we do not encounter other people whilst out.
