I am concerned for the mental and economical well being of humanity. The longer isolation periods are the more affected our world will be but the fewer deaths from coronavirus there will be. I believe that we are in a fragile time because of the different possible outcomes from this pandemic. I think and hope that all of humanity grows from this experience, it is an event that has the opportunity to push us into a new phase of thriving that we weren't in before. However, I am concerned that the opposite will happen, countries will drift further apart and we will move back along the timeline of growth and innovation.
