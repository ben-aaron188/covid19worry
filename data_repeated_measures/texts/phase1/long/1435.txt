Worry is what I feel most.
I am no longer working so I worry about being paid, paying rent, feeding my family.
Knowing that there is no end date increases my anxiety. 
My partner is a keyworker with no PPE being issued. I worry about him and him coming home to our children.
Although the children's teachers have been a great support and I am trying my hardest, I'm worried about them not being in a school setting in case I am not teaching them like they are used to.
We all miss our extended family and not seeing them is hard.
