I have a feeling of anxiety right now, but I don't know what it is about - maybe coronavirus or maybe something I can't put my finger on, something I've forgotten. I feel that this is a surreal situation, but I haven't found it distressing. I am concerned for my relatives and that someone I know may suffer from the virus and have complications. It worries me that it is unpredictable. I'm not concerned very much for my finances, but I would like a holiday when this is over! I am cooped up with my family. We all seem to be getting on OK but I'm definitely aware that there is a lot of stress and anxiety. My 11 year old with SEN (autism) starts secondary school in September and I am wondering what kind of transition there will be for him and how he will cope.
