This situation is horrible for everyone, especially those with existing mental health issues in which their situation gets 10X worse. the government acftion is not enough and i am disgusted at their pathetic attempt to help doctors, nurses, essential staff and the elderly. my father has COPD which makes him very high risk and therefore i cannot go home to see him which has made every day full of panic and worry. I would urge the government to enforce the lockdown more, and to give additional support to high risk individuals and their families
