I feel frustrated that there are still people not self isolating and not taking it seriously. I feel like there should be consequences for people who are still attending large gatherings and putting others at risk. I do not want to be in isolation for longer because others cannot follow instruction and stay at home. My grandparents are very old and so I cannot see them, I miss my friends and this is the longest I have been away from my boyfriend in three years. I'm scared that the people I love will get sick, my mum is a key worker so cannot stay at home so others that can should be doing there part.
