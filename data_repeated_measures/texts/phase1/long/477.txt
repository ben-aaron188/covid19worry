I'm bored stiffless. When I go to the shops once a week this is the highlight of my day. Im tending to be a bit more adventeous with cooking as this the only variation in my everyday life. My house is the cleanest it has every been as I clean it everyday. I do enjoy going for a walk everyday and have ventured to parts of Sheffield lined up for us to potentially live in the future. I never thought I would be excited to go back to work. I'm scared about the economic future and house prices as well as my pension
