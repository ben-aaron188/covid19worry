The Corona situation is worrying me and causing me to be anxious. I am worried about my family who are mostly keyworkers and therefore have to be out and about on the frontlines And thankful that I am able to work from home during this situation and know that my young daughter is safe in the house and we have everything we need right now. In regards to shopping and utilities and general home stuff. I don't have to worry too much about myself but I worry about others. I am anxious over how long this situation will last in the UK and what the follow on effect will be for the world as we know it
