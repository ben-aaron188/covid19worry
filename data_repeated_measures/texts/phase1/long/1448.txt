I feel extremely scared regarding the whole situation. I also feel ridiculously angry that whilst a person close to me is fighting for their life in hospital with corona, there are some people that are not following government guidelines and are still proceeding to see their families and friends. I think it’s extremely selfish of them. I’m worried about the health of my elderly family members rather than myself. I feel a deep sense of sadness for everybody who has unfortunately lost a member of their family and cannot properly grieve their loss at this time.
