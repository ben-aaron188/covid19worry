It is senseless.  If China had been honest from the start and closed borders it would not be happening.  Quite honestly I think they really should be held to account for this.

Why do I have to type 500 characters, I have summed up what i feel and cannot go too much further.

Right, I am not sure what else to say, it is pointless making it a minimum of 500 words, 

So what else can I say.  It is annoying, yes, it is expensive.  But it is what it is and we can do nothing other than try to make it go away as quickly as possible so doing as we are told is important.
