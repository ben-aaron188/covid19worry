The situation with Coronavirus is one that is very scary for everyone. Our way of life has been completely changed and it's had a significant impact on me and I'm sure others. The overriding feeling that I have is fear.  I fear mostly of getting it and giving to the people I love. I also have anger at the government for allowing it to get to this stage and for being ill-prepared.  Anxiety is also an issue as I have to look after getting supplies in for people and not knowing when this will all be over.
