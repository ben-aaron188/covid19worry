I dont feel worry enough to come close to panic. I do feel slightly worried for the wealth of people i know, mostly the  ones who are older. I also feel slightly worried with my financial situation, now and in the future. I dont have many strong feelings to what the corona virus has done to the current lifstyle so far, not as much as i have regarding the future after the virus.
That all that i feel about it at this moment.
