Just watching the daily briefing - another advisory that mask wearing makes no difference to protection of the general public while observing social distancing.... apparently this is based on a scientific study. BUT given that the way the virus spreads is not an exact science, surely throwing everything at it isn't a bad thing? Why not just say if you already have masks and it makes you feel better when shopping crack on? Obviously with PPE being in short supply frontline workers are now a priority, but those of us who acquired masks before the whole thing kicked off shouldn't be made to feel almost as though it's bad to wear them? Masks seem like common sense to me.
