Extremely anxious and worried. 
All the news and media reports are constantly how bad it is and how much worse it’s getting. They never report fairly and just try to sensationalise things.  I constantly feel in a state of panic. I normally suffer from health anxiety so for me a global pandemic is the worst possible thing that could be happening
I am extremely worried about catching it, and worried how we will get out of the lockdown. The government aren’t being strict enough - flights are landing into the uk with no checks and people are gathering in parks. I feel anger towards these people, and also towards the Chinese as they are responsible
