I feel weary and frustrated, I am identified as a key worker and have been moved to shifts to encourage social distancing and have had extremely early starts in the morning which are tiring. I am unable to stay longer in work to finish up a o as I must avoid the next shift. I worry about my aged mother and I miss seeing my grandsons who I would normally see at least once a week. I get stressed by having to reassure people who are worrying and by having to correct misinformation that they may have picked up on social media. I feel patronized by the Queens speech
