I feel very worried, anxious and fearful for myself, my loved ones, my community, NHS workers, keyworkers (including myself) and all those who have been forced to work to keep a living (not key workers). I am very concerned about people who have lot their incomes and people who are homeless. I am very concerned about people's mental health as well as physical. I am deeply worried about possible continued austerity measures in the longer term for people already vulnerable and struggling. I am angry that more wasn't done sooner - PPE and testing should have been sorted out very early on. I am angry that a minority of people are openly flouting the rules.I am also very proud of our key workers and many others in a myriad of ways, big and small who are playing their part to help.
