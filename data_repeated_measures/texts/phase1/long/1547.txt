Annoyed at the people leaving their house when there are frontline NHS staff risking their lives. Anxiety for my family and grandparents if they get coronavirus. Annoyed at the lack of leadership from the start from Boris. The media is making people fearful as it is all negative stories and deaths and constant fear mongering. However, I am hopeful that there are some positives in this e.g. ozone layer is healing, Less pollution. I am also grateful that I am in a fortunate situation compared to others and we're all in this together.
