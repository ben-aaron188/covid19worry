I feel very anxious. I didn't live with my family and the thought of something happening to them without me being able to even go back terrifies me. I'm worried about what will happen in the future and if life will ever be the same. It's difficult to imagine a future without these worries. I'm not sure how I cam help myself with this because I'm scared anxiety like this will be worse for my health than the actual coronavirus, but I feel helpless. I keep thinking I have symptoms and start getting panic symptoms but as soon as I manage to distract myself the symptoms go away.
