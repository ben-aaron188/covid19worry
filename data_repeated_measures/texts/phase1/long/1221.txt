I'm very worried about the situation at the moment. I worry that my family or myself will catch this virus and more and more don;t know how people will react and who will get very sick and even die. I'm apart from my parents and in laws and worried that they're going out and at risk. I'm grateful that I'm able to work remotely and provide for my family also. I worry about what will happen when lockdown ends and we're expected to return to semi normal and what that will look like. I'm worried about how the state our economy will be in after all this.
