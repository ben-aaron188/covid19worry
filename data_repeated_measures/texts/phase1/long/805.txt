This virus has been massively underestimated by all around the world and China needs to face up to being responsible for trying to hide the fact of how dangerous this was righy from the start as, after all, it started in Wuhan province. The world should have taken note of what South Korea has done right from the start as they have the situation under control. Here in Great Britain we have been slow to react and failed to test, slow down the spread and slow to prepare for Covid-19. Luckily we have many dedicated staff in the NHS, the supply lines for food, police force, teachers, cleaners who have helped people in need to get by safely as can be in these strange times.
