At this moment in time I feel worried for others when it comes to covid-19 but I am not worried about myself. I feel some anger towards the individuals who feel it is okay to go against government guidelines and still go outside when it is non essential and have group gatherings. I am worried about our prime ministers health and well being after his covid-19 diagnosis and declining health. I feel proud of myself in this moment for staying in my house and staying away from people who I know covid-19 would severely effect mainly my key worker and elderly family members.
