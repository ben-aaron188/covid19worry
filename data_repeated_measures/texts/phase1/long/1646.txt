At the moment, I am feeling quite sad about the amount of people that are contracting and dying from the virus. Particularly, when it is people who are known to me or have been in close proximity to someone I know. I fear that someone in my family may not be safe. Also, I have some family members in the NHS who I am particularly worried about and my grandad who is vulnerable and living with him has made me anxious about being sanitary. When I don't consciously think about the situation I am able to relax and occupy my time. The worry is that there is no knowing how long the lockdown is going to last and what the repurcussions will be.
