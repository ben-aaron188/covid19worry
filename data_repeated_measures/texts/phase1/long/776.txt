As a key worker I am still working at the moment albeit on reduced hours. I have a young son who cant go to school so I and my wife are home schooling. The lockdown measures, whilst understandable, are really frustrating as there is nothing much to do at the moment. Also very frustrating that my holiday in May wont now be going ahead. The overiding boredom is the thing that is more annoying than anything. From a county perspective there doesn't seem to be any real let up in the number of cases and fatalities so there doesn't seem to really be any light at the end of the tunnel.
