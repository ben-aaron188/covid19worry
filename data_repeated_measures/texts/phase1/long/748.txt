I am 7 months pregnant and I feel sad that I can’t share the experience with my family. It being my first baby I am sad about missing my baby shower and 4D scan feel I’m grieving the normal ness but I am so grateful to be working from home with my partner where we are both safe. I miss my family a lot and it’s made me realise how much I took for granted before. Trying to be grateful each day for our health and home and take the time to get some jobs done around the house that otherwise we wouldn’t have time to do but it still is tinged with disappointment and disbelief at how fast this has all happened.
