I am anxious. I have a disabled daughter with rare, complex disabilities and I do not know how the virus would affect her if she caught it. We have been shielding her and self isolating as much as possible.
I am stressed as I have been juggling looking after my daughter, my 2 school aged children who are at home and my toddler. My husband is a key worker and is still out working, leaving me at home. My 2 school aged children are being home schooled requiring help and supervision.
Lockdown is hard with children keeping them amused, active and engaged.
