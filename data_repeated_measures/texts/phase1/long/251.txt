I'm more worried about mum catching it than anything else.  She's in her 70s and has a hole in her heart so has always suffered difficulties with her breathing and cannot walk far without getting out of breath.  

I've also read a lot of stories lately about people who've been out once or twice since lockdown and have still caught it, so I'm worried about catching it myself and unknowingly passing it on to mum.

Those are my main concerns right now.  I actually don't mind the whole self-isolation thing as I'm happy with my own company and have lots I can do at home.  I'm also able to work from home which alleviates any financial worries.
