I feel content that I get to spend time with my family. I am making the most of the time I spend at home rearranging things with the time I have in my hands I am able to review things and working from home is great as working instead of taking time off so will have enough time off for the summer school holidays. This time away has given me time to do the things I enjoy, going through each day as it comes one day at a time. It was a bit much doing the home schooling for 2 weeks but it was rather draining doing that and working too as that was tiring and I didn't get to do some reading as I would usually do during my commute to work and home on the weekdays.
