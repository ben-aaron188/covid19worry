I feel all sorts of feelings towards the Corona situation, firstly I feel anxious of how long it is going to last, when I will be going back to work, and when I would have some actual face-to-face interactions with my friends. I also feel sad because I had plans for the year, I wanted to start fresh, get a new job, maybe move house, go festivals and go on a few holidays. I also feel slight anger as I had gone to an interview for a new job just before the Corona situation and I still have not heard back from them as their department is closed, that feeling of just not knowing it upsetting, especially when being stuck inside all the time.
