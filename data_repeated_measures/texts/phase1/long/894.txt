I am very worried about the no of cases increasing daily and scared that my partner will bring the infection home as he is a key worker. It’s just a matter of when. 
 Another aspect is the fact that the virus seems to be constantly adapting and is now causing deaths in kids as well. Being a parent, this is a very scary scenario. 
I also worry about my elderly parents back home in India and this increases my feeling of loneliness in the case of anything happening to me/my partner. 
The added stress of keeping the kids occupied, housework, staying inside etc. doesn’t help with this situation.
