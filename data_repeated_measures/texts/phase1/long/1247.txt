I'm fairly relaxed personally, as I'm fairly sure that my family and I have already had covid-19.  I am, however,  angry and disgusted with the government handling of the situation.  I believe that political dogma,  incompetence and ineptitude has lead to many unnecessary deaths.  The government has repeatedly dissembled and blatantly lied about its handling of the situation. If we cannot trust the government under these circumstances,  we are approaching a state of fascism.  Furthermore,  individual members of the government repeatedly flout their own rules designed to limit the spread of covid-19.   Our Prime Minister boasted of visiting a hospital where there were covid-19 patients and shaking hands with 'everybody'. This was an act of criminal irresponsibility.
