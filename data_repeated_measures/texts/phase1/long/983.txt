I feel pretty anxious about how things are going but I'm also hopeful that the measures undertaken by the public to slow the spread of corona are working. 

I worry about how long the current situation will continue. I'm also feeling rather frustrated by having to stay inside more (although I'm observing all the social distancing rules, regardless) and annoyed by people who aren't taking the social distancing rules seriously enough.

I'm also anxious about what the future holds once things start to get back to normal. Although my work hasn't been affected too much at the moment, I'm worried that work (I'm a freelancer) might be more scarce in the future.
