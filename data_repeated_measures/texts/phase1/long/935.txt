I am very worried for the health of my family and loved ones. My husband is classed as a key worker so is still working, I am self employed so unable to work and have no money coming in. The big worry is keeping everyone safe, we are sticking by the guidelines but the worry is always there with my husband having to go out to work. It would be nice to be getting some financial help at the moment instead of having to wait until June. I try to stay positive for my family, we try and make our days fun so that the kids donâ€™t feel anxious about the whole situation.
