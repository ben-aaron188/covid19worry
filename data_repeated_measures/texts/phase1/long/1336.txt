I’m frustrated and sad that we’re locked down and can’t see family and partners. I’m tired of working from home and stressed out at my job as a social worker because I feel I can’t do my job properly. 
I’m constantly worried about my family, especially my elderly grandparents. I’m annoyed my holidays have been cancelled. 
I’m furious at whoever started this pandemic and I’m confused as to how it started. 
I’ve got constant headaches and nausea over this situation and frustrated that some world leaders are not doing enough to protect people. I’m absolutely furious at the idiots that are still going out like there isn’t a lock down because they are stupid and selfish!
