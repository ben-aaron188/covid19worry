I feel like there is nothing that I can do about the corona situation and things just have to run their course. I only go out once per week to get my shopping (which is a slight disruption to my routine, but I like the supermarkets being less busy). My husband and I can work from home. My family and friends are all self-isolating so I am not too concerned about them. I am annoyed at some people disregarding the rules, but I can't do anything about their stupidity. I do not mind being indoors because I have loads of things to do and I am lucky to have a garden. I am super grateful to all of the key workers that are keeping the supply chains going and providing medical support, etc. I am concerned that people may lose their jobs and the way in which the economy will be hit.
