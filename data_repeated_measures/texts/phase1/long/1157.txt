i'm very Angry at the moment as there are many people who are not taking the situation seriously and are still going out of the house for unnecessary reasons. i have been isolating for the past 2 weeks due to being high risk and the more people dont listen the longer i have to stay home and not see my family and friends. My parents and inlaws are missing my daughter and all her milestones and being pregnant right now is stressful as it is.
my mother is also high risk as she is 73 and has memory issues so has still been going out so it stresses me out having to worry about her also.
