Currently feeling very sad about the state of the world. I am upset that I am unable to see my family, especially my grandma. I am also very sad because my boyfriend is at the other end of the country and it is my birthday tomorrow. But I am also hopeful that the end of the lockdown period will soon be in sight. I just wish people would adhere to the lockdown rules, especially as I am still working and coming into contact with colleagues and clients every day and I know that I am at a huge risk of catching the virus myself.
