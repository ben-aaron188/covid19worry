Im quite anxious and sad because of what is happening all over the world. Also a bit angry with people who are ignorants, egoists and dont care about others. Worried about the consequences and impact on our economy and my own buesiness. Hard times. Quite challenging on so many levels, but staying at home is the most crutial thing now and cant really understand how people can grasp the importance of social distancing. We are not passing this test at all. When we should be untited and kind to each other, more empathetic and use our common sence.
