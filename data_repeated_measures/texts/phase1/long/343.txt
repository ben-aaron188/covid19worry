I am a little anxious about catching the coronavirus myself, but more than that I am concerned for friends, family and wider society. I am thankful for staff and health workers who are working to fight this disease, but also angry that they do not have enough supplies or facilities to enable them to do their job properly.

I know this tough period must be done to help the wider society, but on a personal level, I am finding it hard to be locked down in my house all day. I do not have access to a garden and I am very much missing being able to go outside, in nature. I am alone in this city, along way from my friends and family. I am lonely and very bored from sitting in my small apartment each day.
