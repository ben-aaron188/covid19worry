At the moment, I am a little apprehensive over what will happen, both now and in the future, but not unduly worried for myself or my immediate family/household.  I am more concerned about my elderly relatives and the long-term consequences for the UK and world-wide economies.  By following the behavioural guidelines issued by the government and health agencies, I am doing all that I can to remain as safe as I can be, there isn't anything else that I can do as far as I am aware.  It would be a great help if the government's position and advice had remained constant and uniform throughout the current crisis.
