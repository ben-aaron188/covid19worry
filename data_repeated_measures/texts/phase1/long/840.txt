I feel not too concerned, certainly not as concerned as I was. I am anxious for my sister who is on immunosuppressants and my dad who has an autoimmune disorder, but overall I do not feel that anxious. I feel guilty about saying it but there are some positives to the situation. I am a keyworker so I still have to travel into London to work and the trains are very empty so my journey has improved significantly which I am happy about, but I feel guilty that I am happy about that. Apart from this I feel anxious, a bit concerned, but not necessarily fearful.
