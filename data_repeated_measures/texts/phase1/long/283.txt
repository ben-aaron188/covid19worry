I don't feel as scared as I did a couple of weeks ago. I don't think it will be as bad as predicted in the UK, and I think the daily deaths will peak very soon, if they haven't already. I feel sad and worried about Boris Johnson being admitted to hospital. I feel a bit fed up and frustrated about lockdown. I'm worried that we'll soon be told we can't go out to exercise, as that's the thing making me feel normal at the moment. I'm still slightly worried and anxious about the health of my family members (if they were to catch the virus), although I'm less worried that they'll catch it than I was a week or two ago. I'm sad I probably won't be able to go on holiday this year.
