I feel relaxed and comfortable that as a relatively healthy young man that this situation will pass by without affecting me. I feel slightly worried in terms of finances but am currently not affected. I feel relaxed enough to spend my extra spare time doing the things I’ve been meaning to get around to but haven’t had the chance to such as gardening and decorating and so I’m actually quite enjoying my reduced hours at work. I feel confident that a vaccine will be produced fairly quickly and that as a result COVID-19 will become no more troublesome than the flu
