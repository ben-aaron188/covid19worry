I feel so sad all the time. Sad that we have so many plans cancelled and have lost so much time to enjoy after what felt like such a long winter. I feel sad that so many people are dying, helpless with not being able to do more and quite numb too. We stay at home every day, doing our bit to help but my husband is a keyworker, CV facing, and so I worry about whether he may bring the virus home with him. I'm sad that life will never truly be the same again. Although we'll be able to leave our home, go on days out and holidays we'll always have this with us - like people who lived through a war. It's absolutely devastating but I have no anger, people are doing all that they can do and no-one could have stopped this happening. My overwhelming feeling is definitely sadness.
