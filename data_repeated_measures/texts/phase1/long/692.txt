I feel as if a sword is hanging over me, but there is no way to know when it will fall.  My health is not the best, and though I am in a more fortunate position than a lot of others, I am terrified of catching the virus.  I feel as if my life is paused during the lockdown, and though it is peaceful here, there is an undercurrent of anger and fear from everyone I see when exercising or going to the shop.  I worry about my family and friends and feel somewhat isolated from everything.  I miss my job, not only for having something to do, but interacting with people normally.
