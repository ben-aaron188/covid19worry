I feel very insecure and worried about the health of my close family and friends as well as struggling with my own health anxiety. I feel the Government have let us down by not acting quick enough and this both saddens and angers me. I feel desperately anxious for the front line workers putting themselves at risk alongside immense anger with the selfish people in society who are not observing Government guidelines. I feel extremely insecure about what will happen in the future and the aftermath of the situation on many different levels is extremely worrying.
