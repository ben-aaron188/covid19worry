I feel like myself and my close friends and family are doing all they can to support the NHS workers and government guidelines by staying at home and indoors. But it frustrates me when we see people on the TV or social media not doing what we are doing, and still going about their usual business. I feel sad of the families and people who have been effected so far by the virus, and anxious about the effect it will have on myself and those I care about. I have friends in Spain who have been on lockdown since the start of March, I fear for her and her family. I worry that they will not find a vaccine for this horrible virus and that it will take a long time for life to return to normal.
