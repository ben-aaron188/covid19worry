At the moment a little anxious as i have been furloughed and I'm not sure i will have a job to go back to. Also it is unclear when this is likely to end so we don't know what the economy will be like.

The anxiety comes as if i lose my job I'm wont be able to provide for my family and if there is a recession also then it will be difficult to get a new job. The main anxiety is around my family and if i will be able to provide for them as well as other members of my family who are in the high risk category.
