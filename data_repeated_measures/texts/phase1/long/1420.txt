I feel lucky that I live in a house with my family and that we have a relatively stable income. I feel grateful to health workers putting themselves and their families at risk. I feel slightly guilty for not contributing usefully to the situation. I feel annoyed that my husband lives in France and I live in the UK as I don't know when I will be able to see him again. I feel uncertain about what will happen in the future as all my plans are disrupted, I have had to delayed plans for moving abroad and I need to do this before a possible no deal Brexit at the end of the year, so the time is running out.
