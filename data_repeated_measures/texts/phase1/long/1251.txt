The whole Coronavirus situation is very scary. I think the government are doing a decent job at keeping us informed and could possibly have done more at the beginning but that slowly we may be getting there. However I am loath to go outside for fear of catching or passing on the disease and am wary of when it will all end. I am mentally prepared to have to work from home for at least 12 weeks but wonder whether that is too optimistic. I fear any of my family getting the disease and hope that a cure is found sooner rather than later.
