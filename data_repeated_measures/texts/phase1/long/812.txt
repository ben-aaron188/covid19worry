I am a little anxious how long we will be on lockdown for because there is a minority of people who do not listen and the less people listen the longer the lockdown will last. More people will get ill and some people arent taking this situation serious which is frustrating. Lots of people are missing their family and friends and idiots are ruining it for everyone.
The schools being closed is having a huge impact on children and their lives. Lots of schools are a child safe place and that has been taken away.
