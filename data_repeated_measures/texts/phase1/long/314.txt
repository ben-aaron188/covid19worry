Fearful more for my elderly parents than myself...hoping everyone comes out safe. I feel anxious as I dont know about the future. I also find taking each day as it comes helps. These things are put of my control so i will live life with the flow. I worry for my children and hope they stay safe.,, I try not to overthink things because I don't want to worry about the future which is not in my hands. I worry about the Peak in terms of the number of deaths I also worry about out the financial strain on households
