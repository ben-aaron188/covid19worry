I feel quite nervous about the virus as it is quite easy to catch and I could become ill with it or pass it on to the ones I love. I am upset for the people who have died already and that there is little we can do about it other than wait it out. I am also annoyed with the people ignoring the governmentâ€™s instructions as this is needlessly killing and infecting more People and it is also unfair . Lastly, I am worried about the impact on businesses and what companies might not survive... will I still have a job... will my favourite restaurant be open... when can I go for a haircut or dentist again?
