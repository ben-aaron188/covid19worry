I feel anxious and stressed about how long this situation will continue and how long we will be isolated. I worry for my mental health, as I suffer from anxiety and depression and isolation has always been a trigger. 

I feel sad for those who have lost loved ones, especially when I hear of front line workers losing their lives. 

I feel further away from my family than ever before. 

I feel like I'll be judged when I leave the house, even though I am only going out for legitimate reasons. 

I feel angry at stupid people who carry on sunbathing in parks and visiting friends. I also fee angry at people on the street or in the supermarket who don't try to keep their distance.
