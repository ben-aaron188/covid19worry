I feel not too anxious about the corona situation however i feel quite lost and lonely, almost empty rather than sad. I feel bored and tired more often but not angry, i’m a little bit anxious about getting ill but not too bad, however my mum and dad are key workers so i’m more worried about catching it, i don’t feel as anxious as usual tho. I am struggling to feel motivated to do any work and i am struggling to get out of bed and struggling to fall asleep. I feel sad i can’t see my friends or boyfrind
