I am not worried about myself but I am worried about many others and the fact that people my age (21) are dying worries me a bit. It also makes me think about death a lot and how fragile humans actually are. I am extremely worried now that the prime minister is in intensive care as this shows that the virus is not discriminatory when attacking. I try not to read the news too often as it can make me more anxious about the situation but I feel like I need to stay informed about what is going on. I feel quite fortunate in that because I am introverted I am not really affected by lockdown, but I am worrying about how other people are coping.
