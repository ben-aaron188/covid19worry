At this moment I feel calm and relaxed in the comfort of knowing myself and my family are staying safe and following the guidelines. However their is anger in relation to work in food retail as other members of public abuse the convenience of my risk going to work for personal fulfillment of a can of pop, newspapers or chocolate and sweets. Not for the essential items they need. 
Overall despite myself a shop worker and my partner a police officer this time together has deepened and strengthened our relationship and shifted a focus on to our future. Truly highlights who and what is important in my life.
