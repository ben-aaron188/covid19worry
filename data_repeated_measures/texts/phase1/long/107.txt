I had only just started to get my life together, and started to do things socially eg, attending lectures, swimming etc. And now that has all been taken away from me. In the sunny weather, I had planned to go to the seaside several times. Again that has been taken away from me. I even lost money on a hotel booking. I will really feel cheated out of this summer. I also feel annoyed, and frightened by people who are in denial, as they still go about their business, as if nothing has happened, potentially spreading the virus. We must all pull together, then the quicker it will be over.
