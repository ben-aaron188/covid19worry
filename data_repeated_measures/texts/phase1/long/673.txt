I am extremely anxious about the situation. In particular I am worried about losing a family member or friend because of it. I also worry that if I get ill I would not be able to look after my children. It also sounds like a very unpleasant illness with being unable to breathe. I am also worried about the financial impact for my family and I am uncertain how I will continue to care for my children if my workplace (non essential shop) opens before the schools and nurseries. I am worried I will end up letting my work down or losing my job. I think I have become more anxious since Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital as it makes it feel even more serious.
