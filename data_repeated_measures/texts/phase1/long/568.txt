I am very concerned about catching the virus and getting seriously ill then making my wife and children ill. I am also very worried for my parents.  I am worried about my job, at the moment it is safe. I don't like going shopping when I have to. I angry that some people are not following the social distancing rules which will make this last longer. I also worried that people will become more xenophopic after this is over blaming foriegners for these problems.
