I'm anxious for myself and my family.  I worry that if one were to contract this they or I would be all alone with no one around us for support and comfort. 

I'm angry that this was allowed to happen.  I feel better measures should have been put in place to prevent this.  

I worry that if/when things 'get back to normal' that it could happen again!  

Being at home all the time is becoming difficult.  My 7 year old son hasn't left the house for a few weeks now and I feel for him not being able to go to school, see his friends and play.
