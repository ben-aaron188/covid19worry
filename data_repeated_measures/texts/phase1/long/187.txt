I feel anxious that myself or my loved ones may get it. I am worried that people are not taking it seriously enough. I would like to see the lock down be enforced more, this would reassure me. And a curfew would be helpful too, and that would reassure me further. I worry about my husband, who works in the NHS, face to face with patients.
I feel incredibly grateful that we have a garden, a safe roof over our house and that money is not an issue. Going out for a walk (once a day with the dogs) always makes me feel a little better, as does doing exercise indoors.
