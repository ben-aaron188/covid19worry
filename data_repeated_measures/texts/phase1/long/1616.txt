I feel that we are in a very delicate situation right now. The pandemic is really hitting hard in most parts of the world. I fear for my family, where some of my relatives don't have a choice but to continue working. They are at high risk of contracting the virus. This makes me feel fearful half of the time. 

Personally, with the UK going in lockdown, it is the correct decision, but I do feel a little trapped and lonely right now. I feel that I can't escape my home and I hope this changes soon.

Moreover, we're financially unstable as I'm not currently working and haven't been on furlough (up until today).
