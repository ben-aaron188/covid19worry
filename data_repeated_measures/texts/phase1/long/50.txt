I am really worried, worried about how it is going to affect my finances, my husband's job. my own earnings, my investments.  I am concerned about my daughter missing school as she has GCSE's next year, my older daughter missing her life and studies at universities, she is depressed as she is missing her boyfriend.   I am fed up myself of staying in, constantly cooking, not being able to meet my friends etc.  The worse thing is not knowing when it is going to end.  I know that death figures have gone down in the UK today but I am just worried how long we are going to be like this
