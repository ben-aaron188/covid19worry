I feel frustrated that most of the public is still not taking this seriously and a lot of people are continuing to leave the house when there is an official lock down in place. I'm sad that a lot of festivals I was planning on attending have been cancelled but I understand that it was necessary. I'm also feeling sad that I can't see any of my friends or family right now. I don't think my country is doing enough to stop the virus spreading but at the same time I'm not sure what else can be done apart from continue to tell people to stay indoors and hope that it works out.
