I feel worried about the current situation, for myself as I have an underlying health condition, and for my family. I feel sad for all the lives that have already been lost. I also feel stressed juggling working from home with having a small child, and am struggling to stay on top of everything. I am grateful that presently, myself and my family are in good health, and are able to stay at home together away from the risks that come with the virus. I hope that we can soon overcome this awful situation and that the world returns to normal.
