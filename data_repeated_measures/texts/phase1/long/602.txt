It is worrying for my family. I suffer from mental health issues and being stuck inside is making this worse. I feel sad and down all of the time and it doesn't make looking after my daughter easy. I also work from home and I find it hard to fit this in as well. I find that I don't have enough time in the day now that my daughter isn't at nursery. Every day is really hard and it doesn't seem to be getting easier. We have also had holidays cancelled which is sad. We want something to look forward to when all of this is over.
