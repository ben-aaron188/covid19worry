Although i myself am not worried due to my own health not being a worry, i understand why other people may be in complete anxiety over this. Although this is a period of panic and worry, there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel, and some god may come out of this, what I mean by this is the world will be able to try and heal from the years of damage, but we as humans will be able to see a better side of life. Hopefully this changing the way humans views human. I just hope that everyone is taking things serious with the lockdowns, but one more thing which I find interesting is the NHS and the tories, i hope the tories change the opinion of them being a low skills worker after this.
