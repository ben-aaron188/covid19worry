I feel unmotivated as university is now based at home. I am also feeling sad for the amount of future events that have been cancelled. However I'm feeling quite optimistic for the future and I am confident that things will improve. I feel anxious for my family and friends as I do not want them to catch the virus and so i worry about them a lot. I feel confused as well as there are varying sources of information and it is very hard to know what to believe and what is true. I feel uncertain as I don't know what will happen in the future.
