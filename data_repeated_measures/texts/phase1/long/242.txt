I am worried about the current situation. I am worried either me or someone close to me might get it and die. I am most worried about my wife who is struggling as she can’t go out and is having to look after 2 small children whilst I’m at work. I am also worried what life will be like afterwards. It all has to be paid for somehow and I can see some astronomical taxes and price hikes coming. Although I have a job for now as I’m a key worker this will cost my employers a lot of money and I’m sure they’ll start looking at redundancies to save cash and I hope I won’t be one of them.
