I am worried as don’t know when this will end and when it does end what the world will look like. I find it upsetting that people aren’t following the rules and are being selfish. I am also worried about the economy and jobs once this is over. I am finding this situation quite unsettling but I know that my situation is not as bad as many others and I am glad that my family and friends are all safe currently. although I am making an effort to connect with loved ones but it is not the same when you cannot be with them in person and many of our conversations revolve around the virus which is stress inducing itself.
