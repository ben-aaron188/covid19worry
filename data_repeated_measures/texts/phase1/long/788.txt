It is a very scary time as you are not certain who is and isn't affected. I have parents who could be vulnerable, which makes me quite afraid. Also, with the shopping situation, everyone is very selfish and stocking up on everything without thinking about others. Everything is very uncertain. We also don't know how long this will last or even if it will end anytime soon. IT is concerning, especially because deaths are rising as the number of confirmed cases are rising. This can either reach a peak and stop or it may just continue as we have no vaccination. And the vaccination may take up to a year and maybe even longer.
