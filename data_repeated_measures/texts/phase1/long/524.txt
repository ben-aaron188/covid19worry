I am extremely worried for all of the key workers and front line NHS staff.  I am absolutely disgusted with the government's handling of the situation from their initial delay to call for a lockdown and their utter failure to conduct tests for NHS staff (but obviously able to test pm and Prince Charles without issue).  I am very worried about long term consequences of bail out as I feel the most vulnerable in society will be made to pay the highest price in terms of further cuts to NHS and benefits.  I feel very fortunate to book in a situation were I am able to continue to work remotely and be paid and that my husband will be paid by furlough even though he cannot work.  I am grateful to have a garden so I can go outside but know many will not have that luxury.  I feel that my friends and family are safe as they are able to follow rules, but I do worry if anyone I know catches it what will happen to them
