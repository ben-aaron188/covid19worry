With all the steps that have been taken to isolate us from each other, I am not worried about myself and my health. I have a health condition that may not be compatible with the corona virus but I am trying not to think and stress about it at the moment. I am concerned about others who may get infected. I am relatively happy at the moment, trying to make the best out of my situation (i.e. working from home, no commuting to work). I am happy with the actions taken by the government and I think that they are doing they best to deal with this situation.
