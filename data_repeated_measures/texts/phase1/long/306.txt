Worried about my granny, she's got my mum living with her but she's very depressed and has lost interest in doing things (just had a text from my mum asking if I still had a rowing machine as she's trying to get her to do some exercise - I didn't, but she realised she wouldn't have been able to pick it up anyway. Also thinking of my grandad, he lives alone & was just recovering from pneumonia threat had lasted months when all this started so planning to ring him later. I was reading some articles about the situation not long ago so feeling a bit down at the moment.
