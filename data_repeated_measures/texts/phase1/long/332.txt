I feel extremely worried about loved ones contracting the virus. I’m not so much worried about myself catching it - in fact I feel like I have already had it, but my worry is either family catching it or my catching it (if I haven’t already had it) and passing it on to them. That is a worrying thought to me. I am also concerned about the impact this virus will have on a wider community scale in terms of deaths. I’m not too worried about the economy and feel like it will slowly rally. Also concerned about the impact this will have on the nhs and its resources.
