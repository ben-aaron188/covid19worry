At this moment in time I have by now accepted the huge changes that this pandemic has bought about in my personal/family life. I feel anxiety about the potential of the disease to affect any of my family and friends, but the anxiety about loss of work/schooling/uncertainlty over finances/holidays etc has subsided with my acceptance of the situation. I am focussed on playing my part in beating this virus. To some degree I am enjoying taking the time to take in the simple things - family time, walks, spring, birdsong, peaceful roads.
