Concerned that not all people are taking the situation seriously and that this could others at risk. I feel frustrated that shops don’t always have want I want because people take more than they need. I feel annoyed when I see pictures of wasted food. I am trying to enjoy being with my family and ensure that my children don’t become anxious about the current situation. I feel as though it is my role to protect my family but by doing essential tasks and some people being ignorant and not following the expectations
