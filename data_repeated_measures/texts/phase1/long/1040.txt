I fee angry that we have been in this situation, possibly by unsafe practices that appear to be continuing. I feel sad that I can’t see my friends and family or access a doctor as I need to at the moment. I feel anxious that someone amongst my friend and family groups will catch it and not survive, including myself. I am worried for my health if this continues as I need to exercise and we may have to stop going out if the death numbers don’t start to decline. I am also worried about the economy as a whole and how it will recover from this.
