At the moment I feel anxious for both myself & my family.  We are keeping ourselves on lockdown as much as possible, not going to shops, only going out to our garden or to walk around the road we live in.  We are finding it hard to book online supermarket delivery slots, despite both my parents being over 70, which makes me feel stressed & anxious.  I feel sad hearing the news and the latest death toll figures so am limiting my exposure to the news.  Our close neighbours have been a support and we have been swapping food supplies when needed etc, the community spirit has been a comfort and reassuring presence.
