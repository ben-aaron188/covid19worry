At the moment I feel nervous and afraid that I might never see my granddaughters child. My daughter lives in Canada with 3 children and I might never see them again. My wife and I are both in the high risk category and neither wants to be left alone. My focus is entirely on the effect that the current disease has on them and their and my future. Alyhough I am totally self isolating it seems that the true possibility for the transmission of the diseease is unknown. iT truly is the silent killer. The media seem obsessed with dramatising the current situation and constantly are seeking the 'have you stopped beating your wife' question rather than asking the questions that the public want the answers to.
