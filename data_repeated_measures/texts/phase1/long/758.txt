I feel very concerned about the outbreak, also hoping we can get a grip on the situation.  I suffer anxiety so it’s reeking havoc on my condition.  I suffer tightness in chest, so I’m now thinking that is corona virus, would love to be tested.  I’m hanging in there but increasing worry each day.

The news isn’t helping the populations mental health, it’s nonstop morning to night morbid news coverage, I’ve stopped watching.

I haven’t left the house in over 3 years due to anxiety so I can cope with the quarantine side of things
