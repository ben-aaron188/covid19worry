I feel anxious and concerned now that the first two weeks of full isolation have ended. The newness has worn off and I now worry about how myself and society will proceed to cope with what may be months more of isolation and suspended life. I worry that there's no end in sight and that there will continue to be many more deaths and potentially disastrous consequences for the economy and employment.

Having to continue to work in an already stressful job is concerning to me, as I worry about what long-term effects this will have on my mental health. If there was an endpoint to this, then I might be able to grit my teeth and get through it. But with the unknown that this may go on for months or the rest of 2020, it's hard to live in that unknown and perpetually stressed state of mind.
