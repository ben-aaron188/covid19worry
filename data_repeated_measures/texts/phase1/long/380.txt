I actually feel very curious.
I am obsessed with the statistics and the numbers. I can't help but think about how/why no one saw this coming and how come no country was prepared for something like this. How come the economy is so fragile, and how come people are not really following the rules set in place by the government.
I am also curious to know how life will resume after all this. What will change? What will stay the same.
So above all, I am curious. Curious to know more about the disease and its effects.
