I feel exhausted all the time. I have to stop myself constantly refreshing the news to see the latest awful death statistic. It dominates every conversation I have with anyone, and all those conversations are online because of physical distancing. I'm concerned about how this will affect society and the people I care about, but I'm not so worried about getting it myself because I'm young. I feel frustrated by the people not taking this seriously, and I feel let down by the government who continue to act too slowly. I am grateful neither I nor my family have got COVID-19 yet, but I expect we will get it eventually.
