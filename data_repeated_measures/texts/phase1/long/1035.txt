I feel worried and anxious about the future and how unknown and unpredictable it is. I am concerned that the outcome of th situation is reliant on the behaviours of the general public that I feel we can’t rely on or trust. I hope that we are able to ‘flatten the curve’ and enable the Nhs to cope under the current pressures and upcoming challenge, however I am concerned about what the outcome will be if we are unable to do this. I am greatful that I am able to safely stay at home, myself being on maternity leave and my partner being furloed, however admire and respect the key workers who are keeping the country going
