I have stopped watching the news as everything being shown is negative. Several people have recovered but we are not told this. Since I have stopped watching the news I am less anxious. The public are not taking this serious as people are still going out in groups. I think the government should be stricter. I still have to go to work as I work in the NHS and I like that I still have a routine so I understand it can be hard being stuck home. We need to stay in unless we're working or have to buy essentials to ensure the virus doesn't spread.
