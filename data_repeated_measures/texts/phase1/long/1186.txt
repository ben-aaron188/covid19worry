Sadness in general for the effect that it has on the country and itâ€™s more vulnerable population who are suffering the most and dying as well as frustration for those not adiding by the rules and regulations set out but pride for all the key essential workers who are working tirelessly to look after everyone effected in the most desperate conditions - fearful for where the country will be once this has passed and the long lasting effect it will have on our future generations and anxious for our more vulnerable loved ones who we are having to distance ourselves from and missing out on key moments with family and friends
