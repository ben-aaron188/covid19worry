At the moment I feel sad everyday that so many people in this country are dying.  Then I feel fear for myself and my family and friends.  I worry a lot about the state of our finances over the coming months and if this will affect my daughters chances of getting into university.  I worry every time I go out in case I pick the virus up and am trying to limit the amount of times I venture out of the house unless it is absolutely necessary.  I feel dread every time I put the news on, because there does not seem to be any happy news recently, just more doom and gloom.  I feel like we have not a lot to look forward to,
