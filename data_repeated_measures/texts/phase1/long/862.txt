I'm annoyed that I cannot continue my life as normal however I don't mind the enforced isolation as I am more relaxed and not having to worry about many of the daily tasks. I am having more time to do things like yoga and meditation and am spending less money as I'm not out socialising and using petrol etc. I miss my friends and miss socialising however but I have got around that somewhat by utilising online meeting platforms like zoom. I am worried and a little anxious about the future of COVID and wether or not my friends might get it and die
