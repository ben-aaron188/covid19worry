I am feeling particularly anxious at the present moment at the prospect of having to shop for groceries tomorrow. I have tried to get an online delivery and can't and that is frustrating. I have chronic health challenges and don't feel good about going into a store around more people than I have been around in a fortnight. It is scary and intimidating. I don't like shopping in store at the best of times and this feels intense. I resent the people panic buying and making everything so much harder than it needs to be.
