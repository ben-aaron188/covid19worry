I feel very uncertain about the future and anxious, financially, for my family's and my own health and for the future of my career. My industry has been completely shut down indefinitely I have no idea when I will be able to go back to work.
I am used to travelling a lot so it is difficult being stuck at home. Both my partner and I are trying to work out of a two work apartment which is causing a lot of strain.
I am unable to go and visit my family and everyone is finding it very hard.
I am afraid to leave my house so I am not even taking exercise outside which is very difficult as I am not used to being sedentary and as I live in a first floor apartment, we have no outside space which is especially hard when the weather has been so beautiful. I worry that when lockdown measures are relaxed that i will still find it difficult to go outside because I will have become acclimatised. The whole situation feels bizarre and surreal to me.
