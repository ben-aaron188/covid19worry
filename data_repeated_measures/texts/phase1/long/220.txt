Fed up of the situation, which could have been controlled better if decisions were made before they were.
My little boy is desperate to get out the house and socialise. We are so busy trying to protect older/vulnerable people and the NHS we are forgetting about our little people and the damage itâ€™s doing to them! I feel so sad for him and his sister who have no understanding of the situation and just want to go out and play and go back to nursery. I can cope with my own frustrations but my heart breaks for theirs!
