I am fed up about not being able to go out when I want, I miss going to the shops and seeing other people.  I don't like schooling my child from home as it takes up time that I could be doing other things.  But it is good to be able to spend more time with my child and my husband.  I miss being able to go out for dinner.  Its annoying that we do not know how long this is going to last and I am worried that my holiday may get cancelled, as, as a family we have all been looking forward to it since last year,
