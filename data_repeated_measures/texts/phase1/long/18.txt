With the current coronavirus situation, I am more worried in regards to my assessments for my Master's degree more than possibly becoming infected with the new coronavirus. My university had one of the first recorded cases in my area and so had decided to stop face-to-face lectures and halted laboratory work as well before the government introduced the lockdown regulations. I am also more concerned that my family/friends may become infected with it and that it could become severe, possibly damaging their health in the long-term.
