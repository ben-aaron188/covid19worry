At the moment I feel very sad about the experiences I am missing out on because of the coronavirus situation â€“ I have had to leave University early and am now unable to spend time with my partner. I am also angry at the unfairness of the situation and at how the government has chosen to handle the issue. I do feel anxious about the threat of coronavirus against my personal heath and that of my family and friends, and it is also worrying to think about the effects this situation will have more widely, economically and socially. It feels frustrating that there is no clear end in sight.
