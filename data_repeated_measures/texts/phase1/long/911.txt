I'm worried that the coronavirus will affect my future. Me and my family have already lost our jobs temporarily due to this and it seems that our holiday plans will have to be cancelled this summer. I also have a friend who has lost a close relative so I know first hand that this situation is very real and dangerous. Overall I am anxious about the future whether this situation will die out or not for the coming months possibly until next year. I am also very sad at the current situation as I have been stuck in my house without seeing any of my friends.
