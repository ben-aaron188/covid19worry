I am worried for the country with Boris in hospital. Feel OK in self and with family at moment all well. You just don't know what may happen next and our family has a newborn baby. Its sad not even able to go and visit as we had planned. Happy that family well so not all bad. Relieved shops not as chaotic as they were. Although seeing more emotional flareups than we usually do. In balance have a good feeling of community support. See that on thursday clap for the cares and support staff that continue to work. More good than bad people. Just wish was back to normal.
