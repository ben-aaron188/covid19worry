I am concerned for my family and friends; especially those who are older and have pre existing medical conditions. My Mother is a key worker and works daily with the public so I worry for her. I have NHS nurse friends who are working very hard and I feel proud of them- they have given me insight into how bad the situation is. I am anxious about my children possibly contracting the disease and we are being careful to stay at home. I am annoyed and angry at those in the UK who refuse to social distance or stay at home despite the risk to them and others.
