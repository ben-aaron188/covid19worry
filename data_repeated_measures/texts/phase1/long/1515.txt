I feel generally okay at this moment in time. I have food and supplies at the moment although I am concerned about the thought of having to venture outside should I need to buy anything from stores. The last time I went out to the shops, over a week ago now, there were large queues outside every one. Most of the anxiety stems from the behaviour of other people and my distrust of them. Anytime I have either visited shops or had an online delivery to my home, there have been items unavailable due to the ridiculous stockpiling of others. Most of my concern is for my family and their health.
