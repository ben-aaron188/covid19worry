Although I count myself very lucky to still have a job. I am very anxious as I support vulnerable adults. I fear that I could spread the virus to those I support.
I also worry about becoming ill myself as statutory sick pay is too low to cover the bills. 
I worry about the health of my family and I feel a lot of sadness for those that have died.
I also feel upset about the way that key workers have always been treated. Underpaid and under appreciated. Yet now people clap for us. While this is nice recognition, I still believe that once this is over, we will return to the way it was before.
