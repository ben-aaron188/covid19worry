I am not unduly worried about the situation as I am not in a category of increased risk, nor do I live in an area with many cases so far. My Friends, partner and wider family are fine and in good health, and my job is highly unlikely to be at risk no matter how long the lockdown continues. I own my house and therefore have no worries about landlord issues. I hope that the situation resolves itself as quickly as possible for the benefit of the whole world, but I am suitably prepared for things to get worse before they potentially get better.
