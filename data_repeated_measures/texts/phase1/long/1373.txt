Tired and anxious. Worried about my parents, and about a friend who has the symptoms and is vulnerable. Angry at the government's initial handling of the situation. Shocked at the death toll. Relieved that my employer is in decent shape to weather this but worried for the people who aren't so fortunate. Anxious for friends who work in the NHS or other essential roles. Concerned about the current and future economic effects. Looking forward to when this is over, and considering how we can work together to ensure a better society comes out of it.
