I feel very apprehensive about my future at this current time. I am currently furloughed from my work and don't frankly know if I will have a job to go back to, this in turn increases my anxiety over money, paying for things etc. The actual virus itself whilst being the cause of these issues seems to be the least serious of them at this time. I am complying with the government instructions by not going out unnecessarily but when you see people flagrantly ignoring the distancing rules it makes me angry because they will be the reason for this continuing longer.
