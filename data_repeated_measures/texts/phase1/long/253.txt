I am worried about the virus but for the first time today I feel more like my normal self. My husband left his work and he contacted them to ask if he could be reinstated and furloughed. They said yes! So I am so happy we are at least getting 80% of the wages. Universal Credit just would not have been enough. The last few weeks I have not felt myself. I have thought about my relationship with my husband in a negative way. We have two children and have not gone out for three weeks. The sun was out today, we had a chat with a neighbour over the fence and things are looking ok finance-wise. I have heard on the news that the number of deaths has dropped slightly and that has given me hope. Cross fingers.
