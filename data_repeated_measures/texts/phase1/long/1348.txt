I have not watched or read the news today for the first time in around  two weeks so that’s most likely why I’m feeling somewhat relaxed - have not read into how many people have died because of coronavirus today etc. I have not left the house in 15 days today and the members of my household have left a handful of times so I’m not too fearful about getting coronavirus. I miss seeing my friends but I know this is for the greater good. As always I am thinking about how long lockdown will last and what the lasting effects will be.
