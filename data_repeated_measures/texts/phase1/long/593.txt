I have just heard that the UK Prime Minister has been taken into the  Intensive Care Unit, this is absolutely shocking and I feel very anxious and a bit frightened. I was already feeling pretty anxious and slightly fearful but hearing this news has totally shocked and appalled me. I have felt a lot more anxious since the virus has become more and more widespread, this anxiety partly comes from being a key worker and partly due to having a child with asthma. I fear that if I catch the virus I could pass it to my husband or my son.
