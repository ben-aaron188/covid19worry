Due to having a very weak immune system where I was hospitalised when younger I am concerned about my well being, self isolation can only do so much and the fear is people in my house who still need to work potentially bringing the virus into my household, having spent a month in isolation what I do on a daily basis is being limited as I am getting burned out of the things that I frequently do to entertain myself which I turn is also frustrating, another annoying aspect is that I am not in a position to see close family including my mother who I would normally see everyday but that luxury is now not available to me during the current pandemic
