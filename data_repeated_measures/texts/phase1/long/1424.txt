Mostly I am continually anxious. Stuck in a weird dichotomy of trying to relax and make the most of working from home and the opportunity that extra time presents, and the angst and fear of  losing work, possible health impacts on friends and family and having to survive on even less money.
This is amplified by the constant frustration that the truth surrounding government response is clouded in obfuscation and political games. 
I am generally skeptical of consensus and as we are presented with a narrative that suggests that we may harm ourselves or others severely If we choose to question the narrative, this presents a hard pill to swallow. As such I am finding myself immersed in the horrendous story as it happens, and simultaneously horrified by my complicity in my own mental torture.
