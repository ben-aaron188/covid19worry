I feel trapped in my own life. I am stuck in this flat, with my boyfriend that I want to break up with, with no job or income. I was on the verge of a new start and now everything is paused. I also feel hopeless about the prospect of jobs when this is over. I have already been in self isolation for around 5 weeks because I lost my job just before this all happened and of course it's now impossible to get another one. I have felt suicidal and desperate. Tomorrow it's my birthday. I was meant to be in a spa. I just want to escape.
