It's a very tough time at the minute and is only gonna get worse i feel. It's not very nice at all, but it has to be done. However it ain't helped by selfish people going out in public when being told to stay indoors as that dont help things. It will make it worse and in a few weeks we will see the severity again. It's a very worrying time currently and I cant wait for it to be over. I miss seeing my friends and family and socially meeting people. It all makes me very sad and I've often felt lonely cus of it. I'm also angered by what people have been doing but not so much at the virus.
