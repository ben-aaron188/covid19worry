I am mostly concerned for those people who are particularly vulnerable to this virus. I live with two people who fall into this category, so have been rather aware of the need to try and prevent unnecessary spread.

I am also somewhat angry with the people who do not seem to be able to grasp the potential seriousness of the situation, and who feel that because they aren't particularly at risk of serious illness from it they don't need to worry about spreading it. Fortunately those people appear to be in the minority.
