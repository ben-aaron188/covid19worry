I am somewhat worried about the virus, various members of my family refuse to social distance and are still visiting friends and older relatives. I am unable to self isolate with my partner, meaning I haven't seen him in three weeks. This is making me feel desperately unhappy and stressed, and has put an extraordinary amount of strain on our relationship, which would not be there had the pandemic not happened. I feel very lonely and isolated, and very worried about my partner and our relationship.
