I work as an emergency department nurse. I am seeing sick patients. Whilst worrying about contracting Coronavirus, I feel I have done good protection.
I have anger that some people are oblivious to the danger and digitalising as normal.
Iâ€™m irritated that others are paid 80% of their wage to stay at home, whilst I am paid my normal wage to put myself at risk.
I worry that I could contract the virus at work and pass this onto my immediate family at home.
I am also concerned that Boris Johnson is in hospital and suspect his health is worse than has been disclosed
