At the moment I am going through mix of feelings. There is happiness as we are together as a family, my husband is spending time with our kids more than before, because he is stuck at home. It feels good to take time, not to worry about going out or spending money in shopping.Than there is anger because my son's birthday is cancelled, I can't order neccessary things to bake cake as all online slots are gone for ages, my husband is not so good at shopping but he goes to shops because he is the one who drives.I can't order my son personalised birthday card as I did las 10 years because last 2 weeks it is not possible. Than there is sadness that people are dying but at the same timeI can;t believe that everything is locked, people are staying at home, no planes no visits nothing and statisticly every year from flu die even more people. I find TV and newspapers fear mongering and I am so worried about people with mental issues because beeing on their own without help and no one to turn to in most needed minutes could involve even more uneccessary death.
