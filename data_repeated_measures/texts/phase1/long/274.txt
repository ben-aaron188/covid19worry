I feel sad for all the heartache this has caused people and their famileis. I feel anger towards  the government  beacuse of  the way they have handled this situation. I feel scared that our childrens mental health is  suffering. I feel uncertain about the near future and worried that the worse is still to come. I have no confidence in the way the  experts are handling  the Corana virus. i fear for the world as a whole  and i dread that the United Kindom will overtake countries like Spain and Italy. I do not understand why more testing is not being carried out  and I  am furious that key workers are not bein given the correct proctection uniforms/equipment. The whole situation just seems like a big nightmare.
