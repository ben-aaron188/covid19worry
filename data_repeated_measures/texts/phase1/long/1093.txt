I am Concerned and apprehensive about the future. I wish people would listen to guidance so we could get put the lockdown I want to return to normal. I hope the people I care about stay safe. My husband is a key worker and I’m glad he’s got normality but wish we could all either be together safe or have normality again. I hope we are able to travel again soon as we have special trips planned for later in the year but I fear that won’t happen I also worry about wether I have a job to go back to when this is over.
