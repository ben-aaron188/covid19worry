I feel more lonely than usual and isolated from my friends who I would usually see on an almost daily basis. I'm frustrated at being kept at home but obviously understand the importance of doing so. I hope the situation is over quickly so we can go back to normal - partially at least - and meet up with friends again even if mass gatherings are still banned. I would definitely feel more positive if there was a clear end date for the lockdown but this is obviously hard to predict. Lastly, I feel sad on behalf of all the families who have lost any loved ones due to the virus.
