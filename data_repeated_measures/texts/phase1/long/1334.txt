I am worried about the safety of my family as I am not able to be with them, especially my vulnerable father. I am also a key worker and worried about getting sick myself, as it seems young healthy people are not safe from serious illness. I also worry now the prime minister is in intensive care that the morale in the country will be even lower, and am anxious about what would happen if he were to pass away. I am angry at people who continue to flout the rules and sunbathe and meet friends, and do not understand why these rules are important.
