Very anxious about the future and finances. People arenâ€™t complying with government advice either and so this makes me quite worried. The incompetence from the NHS and lack of PPE makes me very worried for family and friends who work in the healthcare sector. The government have also done very little to financially support students, as someone who is in their final year of study, the virus has heavily impacted the fluency of my studies. It has been an extremely stressful and tense time for me and my family due to the uncertainty and instability.
