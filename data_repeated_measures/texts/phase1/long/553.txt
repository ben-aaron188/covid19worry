i feel really down as i suffer with depression and going fishing helps but cant go at this moment in time so it is really getting me down, i have managed to get a lot done in the garden that has needed doing so that is a positive but really need to get things back to normal asap, for myn and my families sanity, iss seing my father as he is in at risk group and havnt seen him in over 3 weeks now, my children are getting bored of not being able to go out and see friends, they also miss school its just not the same learning from home as in school with all their friends
