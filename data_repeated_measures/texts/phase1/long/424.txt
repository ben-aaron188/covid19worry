i think personally i feel worried about my family catching the virus, my parents are over 70 and have health problems.  I have 2 children (Both are ASD) and a partner  we all suffer from asthma and i have diabetes. The risk of getting the virus seems pretty high, but we also have to do the normal day to day activities such as shopping, taking out the rubbish, etc.  

I fear if i catch the virus it will kill me, i take a long time to heal from cuts due to my blood sugar problems and history of infections. 

i look forward to this being a thing of the past
