Very anxious, I've tried to not follow the news so much with the death toll and new cases statistics constantly increasing.

Also stressed out due to my current living situation - not a good environment at the best of times let alone when we're all anxious and are together all the time. There's no respite from the environment I usually go to work or to the pub or to see my family and friends to escape.

I'm worried about not having a job to go back to or the government subsidy of wages stopping if the lockdown exceeds a few months.

Due to the news earlier about the prime minister going into intensive care I'm worried about the future of the country and what will happen if anything happens to him.
