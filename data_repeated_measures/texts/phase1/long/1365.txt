I am slightly anxious and worried for family and friends who are older or suffering from pre-existing conditions which increase the mortality chances from COVID-19; self-employed close family worrying about the financial aspects around this; friends who have lost their jobs; and family and friends working in the NHS.

I am fortunate enough to live with a friend of the same age (30), with no children, and able to work from home with a rather low risk of negative impact to employment status. So in that respect the main sense of anxiousness is in regard to others, yet also the social distancing and lack of face-to-face contact with friends and family causes a sort of sense of disassociation from normal reality (rather than loneliness or isolation per se).
