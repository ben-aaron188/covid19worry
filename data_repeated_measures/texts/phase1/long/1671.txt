From seeing the daily death rate increasing and people still getting infected is not great, plus with some of the public still believing they are 'immune' or the lockown rules don't apply to them is frustrating for all who are trying to handle the situation. The press inform regularly but not to the level of scaring people into a frenzy. Panic buying has declined a great deal, social distancing seems to work for a high majority where I live but some still don't get the need to look after themselves and each other. Have signed a petition to see if live animal markets have tighter controls if not banned in China, as I believe that countries with this level of mentality should know better, change their barbaric ways. I understand food sources are a requirement, but needs far better control especially where the pandemic has run rife throughout the world (this all depends on truth of the source of covid19)
