I have really bad anxiety about it all to the point where it is making me feel sick. The Prime Miniater currently has is and that kind of hammers home that anyone can get it (although we're not all shaking hands with covid+ patients so should be okish on that front). I'm worried about my family getting it as currently know someone who is in ICU suffering from the effects of it. I'm aware of how horrible the suffering is and I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I'm also anxious regarding my job and how this will affect it going forward. Will I be furloughed or will I eventually lose my job all together. My two year old is also struggling with not seeing his grandparents and it's beginning to affect me seeing how much he is confused and upset by it all. Could do with it disappearing and things going back to normal as soon as possible.
