I fear that someone in my family will get the virus. I am worried for my children if I were to get it. I am anxious about being able to provide enough food for my family. I am anxious about having enough  money to pay my bills. I try to keep my anxiety and worries to myself so my children aren't affected but they are missing their grandparents and friends. I am worried about what will happen afterwards - if my job will be safe. The economy will surely suffer and no one knows how long it will take to recover.
