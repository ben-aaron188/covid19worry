I feel very anxious about how's long this will last for. The isolation situation is not helping my mental health at all. I am worried about work and how this will impact it long term. The advice is constantly changing and mixed messages are rampant. I have to go to a second NHS job and don't know if I will have protective gear. I'm scared I could not only catch it, but pass it on to someone. This would distress me greatly. My motivation is very low and I'm worried about annoying my partner and his family whom I'm in isolation with.
