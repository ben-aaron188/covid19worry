I'm more concerned for the health of family members than myself.  The daily death total stories are quite sad but don't really scare me as we were prepared for them.   It's not hard for me to remember to take the extra precuations like hand washing and keeping distance, although I'm unsure how much these can truly protect me.  I'm annoyed and frustrated that some people are still not obeying the lockdown rules, such as those sitting on benches drinking or hanging out in parks, and also annoyed that the government didn't act sooner.
