I really miss everyone, I feel like I really didn’t appreciate simple things like taking train into town, or just seeing my friends. I feel like it was a good lesson for everyone, and of course it’s more than that, what with lots of deaths, but I really hope we come through this stronger. I am getting very bored around the house and I am worried about my education and catching up on my university course. I can’t wait until everything goes back to normal and I know I will appreciate it a lot more.
