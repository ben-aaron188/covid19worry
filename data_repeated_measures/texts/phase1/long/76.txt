I feel apprehensive for my elderly parent but fairly chilled about my own situation. This varies from day to day of course. The good weather really helps. If this happened at winter it would be a different matter.  I often wonder how much longer this can go on for. Will people stay patient? Id like to know if Ive had it so I can help other people without worrying about infecting them or getting infected. 500 characters is way more than I thought it was. Im startimg to have quite strong feelings about that.
