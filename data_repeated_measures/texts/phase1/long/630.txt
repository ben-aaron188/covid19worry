I'm very anxious for my family and my job. I have just been furloughed regarding my job and this means the government will pay 80% of my wage which is amazing considering others have been laid off, however, it has got me stressing with money as I'm only part time and I struggle with 100% of my wage nevermind 80%! As I said about family also, I don't live with my parents but both of them and my little brother are all classified as essential workers which means they are still going to their jobs. My partner who lives with me also works with my mum and so he is classified as an essential worker and I'm worried for their safety and health. My grandparents also have health conditions and I'm very worried for them. It's just a stressful time for everybody but it's making me more anxious than usual (I'm diagnosed with anxiety as it is).
