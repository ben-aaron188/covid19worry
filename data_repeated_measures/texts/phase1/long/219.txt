I am feeling very worried and anxious about the whole situation, from the immediacy of my family, or myself, catching the virus and dying, through to the longer term impacts on the economy and the well-being of my family (such as access to work, education, being able to maintain our rented home, accessing food etc). Its made me so bad I am chronically hyperventilating with anxiety, which makes me more anxious :( I just want my life to go back to where it was, as i felt that we were just getting our life on track. I worry that i will lose my work, and end up with no money to pay for our home, our food and that will mean my kids suffer, and i dont want that.
