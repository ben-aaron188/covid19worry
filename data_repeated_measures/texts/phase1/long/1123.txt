Very anxious and worried , there is no time frame so that’s worrying and there a lot of people dying. For me I need a busy lifestyle and this is preventing this from happening making me more anxious and upset. I feel like a lot of my life was on pause. I just want it to be all over and I’m praying for everyone that has a had a loss in this time and the nhs for doing such an amazing job. Everyone has come together but it is a very sad and confusing time which will be looked back at for years. I feel fustrated because there isn’t a cure and hopefully this will come about it. It’s just a very difficult time in general.
