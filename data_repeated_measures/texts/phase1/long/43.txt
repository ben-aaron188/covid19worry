Its making me sad seeing the numbers come in everyday and seeing the nurses and health care staff that are dying as they don’t have the protective equipment and access to testing. I’m also a key worker and it’s a very stressful situation and frustrating when people don’t listen to the government and are still going out and seeing friends or going to look around shops because they are bored. I’m hopeful for better testing in the coming weeks. The U.K. daily briefings are helpful and informative at this time
