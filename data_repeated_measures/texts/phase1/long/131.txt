It is frustrating not knowing when it will end or when things will get back to normal, or even if they will get back to normal. It's hard to believe it won't change society in a fairly major way, although it's impossible to say how.

At the moment, it feels like everything and everyone is in a state of limbo and only experiencing a half-life.

I would say I currently have a permanent sense of low-level anxiety.

I am also angry that the government has clearly not taken this seriously and, even now, isn't doing the things it needs to, in terms of supplying PPE, testing and respirators in the necessary quantities.
