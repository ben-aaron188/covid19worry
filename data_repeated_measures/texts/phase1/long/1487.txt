I am feeling calmer now we’ve been isolation for 3+ weeks but I feel so scared for family and friends. I continue to feel anxious about deliveries and the ‘outside world’ coming in to our bubble. I am in awe of those on the front line. Normally I am very impatient but I’ve come to terms with the fact this will be a long and painful process in many senses. I feel concerned for my son that this social distance will ostracise him from learning opportunities and the ability to socialise. At 2 years old I am relieved that he does not understand some of what he is missing out on. The only positive emotion comes from the opportunity to spend quality time together as a family without interruption.
