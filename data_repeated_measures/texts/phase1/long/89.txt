Very worried for my family,very bored with lockdown and aching to get back to work ,concerned just how much longer lockdown will last and just want an end to the uncertainty .Boredom is a big issue and finding it very hard to maintain this pace of life,not something I am used to and anxiety us getting harder to cope with as is the daily UK update on those who are sadly losing their fight with the disease, this is hard to hear every day.I have ti continue to caress for a disabled family member which means I put them at risk every time I enter their home
