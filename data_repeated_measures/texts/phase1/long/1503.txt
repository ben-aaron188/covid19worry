I'm angry at the Chinese government for allowing wet markets, and for trying to shut down the reporting of it when it first appeared in Wuhan. I'm angry at the British government for being so slow to respond and for taking such a ridiculous approach, initially (herd immunity), and for also being incompetent at replying to offers of proper test kits, i.e. South Korea. I feel sad that we don't know when this will end, and I feel sad that I don't know when I will get to see my boyfriend, family and friends again.
