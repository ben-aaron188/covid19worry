I feel angry that the government is not providing NHS staff with correct safety equipment and thinks that a few token claps will make up for austerity which has harmed our NHS' ability to cope with the crisis. I'm angry that they're blaming people not socially distancing on the rise of cases, when it was their initial complete lack of action due to the ""herd immunity"" strategy that has caused it. They're making us pay for their incompetency. I'm angry at the fact the government is encouraging health service to withdraw ventilators to those they deem to be less deserving of it, i.e. the disabled, sick and elderly.
