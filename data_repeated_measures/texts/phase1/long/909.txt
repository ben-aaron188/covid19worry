I'm mostly just worried about the whole thing. I don't want to get poorly so i am afraid about that and even more afraid of my family getting unwell. Im also anxious about what the future holds for not only me but the country in general as i fear its going to be a long time until things are ok again. And im upset as i am struggling to be stuck in the house and i dont know if theres going to be any food shortage so its a constant state of stress and worry.  im not sure what else to put as ive explained really.
