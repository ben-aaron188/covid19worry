Feeling anxious and scared about the future. I'm scared of getting I'll or my family getting ill. I do think we all had it before it was announced. We were all so I'll in January, and my newborn was rushed to hospital on oxygen. They didn't know what was wrong. When will life get back to normal? Will it ever get back to normal. I have 3 year old and a 5 month old. Its the not knowing and nobody knowing about the future that is so scary. I feel like we are living in a film and one day I will wake up. I miss my family and friends. I miss sitting in a coffee shop.  Even though I am scared, I am hopeful things will turn out ok... At some point!
