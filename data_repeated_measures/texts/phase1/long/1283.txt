I feel very anxious and concerned about coronavirus, in terms of the impact it is having on peoples' health and mortality in my country, whether it might impact my family and loved ones in a similar way and also anxiety at the lockdown and sudden restrictions that have been placed on our every day life. I find it very difficult to explain to my children why we are unable to go out and do the things we usually do but, as a positive, I am very proud of their resilience and how adaptable they have been to this situation. It feels difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel but I do believe this will pass eventually and we will look back on this time as being awful but that we got through it.
