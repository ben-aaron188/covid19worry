I am a key worker for a telecommunications company and I am happy to go in and do what I can to help my customers, my call centre is clean and they are giving us a free lunches and provide hand wash and sanitizer. It gives me a break from isolating so has not really made much difference to me personally. I am concerned about how the world will keep spinning but we have to evolve, human kind has done it before and maybe this is the way that the world keeps turning and eeks out the weak so the rest can continue.
