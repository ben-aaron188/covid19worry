I feel very insecure in my feelings about the current corona virus situation.  Although i feel that progress is being made towards beating the virus I feel that we are being kept out of the loop as far as the government information that we are being given.  There seems to be no end or light at the end of the tunnel to be found and I feel that the government are making it up as they go along and have no set critiera as when to lockdown will end. I would feel a lot better about the situation if the government were to be a bit more open with us and treat us more as equals as far as it comes to sharing information and progress.
