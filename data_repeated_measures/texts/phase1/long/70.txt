Terrified of Corona virus. It has already taken one member of our family who was practising government guidelines .  The state of the country and what we have to do to survive this is frightening and where we will be at the end of it. i worry for my children and grandchildren , finding it difficult to sleep and i am in here for 12 weeks without seeing them. I want to believe the government are telling us the truth about figures and equipment being sourced but it is hard to believed them.  We have had different figures etc from different people . I also know the government said there were no corona patients and there was because a family member ( a nurse) works with the patients . It does not help with anxiety or trust
