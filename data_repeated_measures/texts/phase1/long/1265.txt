At this moment in time I feel very worried about how bad its going to get in the UK as we still have not hit our peak. Myself and my 2 siblings all have a lung condition so its even more scary for us and potentially life threatening for us if we catch it. We are fully self isolating and not going outside at this time and a lot of my friends and family are the same which is encouraging that their following the government guidelines. It angers me when I see people on the news or social media who are ignoring the advice.
