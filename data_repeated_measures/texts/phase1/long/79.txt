I'm very worried about the current coronavirus situation, particularly for my family and close friends. I'm also concerned that we may not be pursuing the correct government approach, which may lead to a longer lockdown or greater number of deaths. It's very hard to know what to believe in the media, and the conflicting reports are making my anxiety worse. 

I'm also struggling with the lockdown, Although I am fortunate enough to not have to travel, the loss of freedom is affecting my mental health.
