Fear of how we get out if this as a society and world, how we can stop social distancing (once this calms) without it flaring again. Fear for those who can die from this. Sad of the impact, but heartened to see community responses, people wirking together, helping one another. Exhausted by effort just to shop etc, but know everyone dealing with that. Anxious as been ill for three weeks with likely CV but can’t get test so won’t have it confirmed. However also relieved as doctors believe I’ve had it, and I was high risk but am recovering. I have so many questions!
