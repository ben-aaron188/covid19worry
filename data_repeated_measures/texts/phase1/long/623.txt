This whole situation is making our lives worse as we just leave in fear,in the house,lonely and while most of the days are fine,some are just unreal and I wish the focus could be on something else rather than corona.You hear about it everywhere,its incredible like the whole world stopped and we forgot to live.People are going against each other and emtying shelves.This siuation has shown how egocentric the british people are.We are trying hard to show to whole world how deservant us british are,but this corona situation has shown the worst out of people
