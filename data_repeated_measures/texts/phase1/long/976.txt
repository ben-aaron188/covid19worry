I think that's it's scary that people are not adhering to the lockdown rules, making the problem worse and spreading the virus even more. I feel this may go on for longer than necessary, people should listen to the guidelines. This is something that will have detrimental effect on the world. Economy and everyone's wellbeing, i feel life will never be the same again!!!! I can't say anymore, i just want people to stay at home, stay safe, save lives and save the NHS!! Listen and adhere!!  The World Health Organisation and Public Health England have also warned there is no need to panic buy face masks, latex gloves or other extreme protective gear if you practise good basic hygiene like regularly washing your hands and covering your mouth and nose if you cough.
