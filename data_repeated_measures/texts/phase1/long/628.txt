I keep feeling that it should've been taken care of better and much sooner, it really is very saddening, especially hearing of the number of deaths every day and of the toll it has on those that are working hard to help. It almost seems like few people are taking it seriously still now which can be infuriating, especially when blatantly witnessing them not sticking to the guidelines set. I am most worried for my parents who are more at risk. I really hope things can clear up and head in a better direction soon. I will continue to try my best to protect my family and others.
