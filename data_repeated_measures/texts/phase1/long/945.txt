I feel a little worried - I'm sleeping well, not waking in the night but I am concerned about the risk for my family and myself. I don't have any underlying health conditions but I'm a single parent and want to be able to get through this safely. I work for the NHS in an administrative role in a psychiatric hospital and I am still working so more exposed than those who stay home. Sometimes, I feel scared about the risk, slightly scared and anxious about having to go into work where I feel I am more at risk.
