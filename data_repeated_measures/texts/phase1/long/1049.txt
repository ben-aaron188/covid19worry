I feel anxious about when the coronavirus will end as I’m due to give birth in 11 weeks so want things to be better by then so my newborn baby can be introduced to friends and family and I’m nervous about giving birth alone. I live by myself so I want to see friends and family as I feel lonely but my dog keeps me company. I’m also worried about money as I’m self employed and rent a flat so don’t know how I will pay my bills especially as I have a baby coming along. It annoys me when people are still out seeing friends and family and not sticking to the social distancing rules
