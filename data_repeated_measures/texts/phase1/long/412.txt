I am a little bit anxious as I am working from home, but I do not feel like I am being disciplined or productive enough. However I am quarantining with my partner. I am going to be moving into his place in September so this has been a good test. Fortunately it has been going really well, despite the fact that his flat is not very big. As he normally works away during the week it has been nice to spend so much time together. Apart from that I would consider myself to be coping pretty well with quarantine. I feel like I am suffering from some boredom like everyone else, but appreciate being able to commit properly to my running and exercise program. I now know someone who has died from coronavirus so I am still saddened by that, but overall am not overly concerned about the risk to myself as we are sticking to the government recommendations regarding self isolation.
