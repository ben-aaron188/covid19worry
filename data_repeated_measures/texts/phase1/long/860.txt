Along with the rest of the population, the situation we are seeing progress every day is unprecedented and therefore very worrying. It is difficult seeing the number of deaths on a daily basis, reeled out on the news like it is the norm. It is a particular concern for those of us who have elderly parents at high-risk categories. Yet, if there is anything at all positive that can be taken from this, it's that maybe it will give the planet time to recover a little from pollution, and allow people to just slow down and hit the reset button. We will get through this. The world will continue to turn.
