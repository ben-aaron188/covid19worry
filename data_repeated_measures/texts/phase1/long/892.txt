I am very worried and anxious about my close family and friends health. My father has just come home from hospital after a 9 week stay, he has a very low immune system so I am terrified of him catching it. My partners father only has weeks left to live due to cancer, we are distraught at the fact that we may not be able to attend his funeral. 
I am also very worried about money due to my partner being self employed for only 7 months which means we do not qualify for a grant. Also all his jobs have cancelled. We have a 1 year old daughter who is luckily to young to understand, but I am worried about the world she's growing up in.
