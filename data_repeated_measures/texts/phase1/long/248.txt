I am worried and sad about the current Corona situations. I've had to close my business until further notices which I completely understand but I'm also sad about it as I love what I do. 

I am worried about friends and family. I have a relative in a care home and we know that if he gets the disease then it is very unlikely that he'll survive. This makes me feel extremely sad and also guilty that I can't visit him though I understand the reasons why I can't.

I'm also worried about a number of people that I know that live with mental ill health. They are struggling, really struggling and I do what I can by texting and talking to them.

I'm also very proud of my family. My children are now home from university. One of them is waiting to hear about what is happening with her finals and the other is in his first year. I couldn't be prouder of how they are responding to the virus. They are both doing everything they should and shouldn't be doing and they are being very supportive and helping keep morale high in our house. 

Sad, anxious, worried but proud.
