Disgust at the number of people flouting the social distancing ban. Also disgusted by people abusing key workers and especially angry at the individuals who find it necessary to spit at others and inflict fear that theyâ€™ve been infected. 
Worry for my family who some are in the very vulnerable and vulnerable categories. Also worry with ensuring they have the necessary food for their 12 week isolation. 
Sadness at the number of deaths so far and the likelihood it will get worse before it gets better. 
Hope that the numerous research departments will develop a vaccine or treatment. Hope to participate in a clinical trial and assist in this too.
