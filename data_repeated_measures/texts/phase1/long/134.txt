I feel absolute sadness at the way this virus is indiscriminatory. The speed in which it kills is frightening and to see the death toll rise on a daily basis horrifies me. It saddens me that every day people are putting their lives at risk to save others and there is no way of knowing who has it until it is too late.
I wish that people would take it more seriously, that everyone would adhere to the restrictions that have been put in place for our own good, I feel for the medics who are coming into contact with people who have it everyday and for the people who have lost loved ones and never got to say goodbye. It's a truly horrifying - and terrifying - virus,
