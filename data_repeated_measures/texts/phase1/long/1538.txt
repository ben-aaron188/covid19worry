There is nothing I can do, it's out of my control so I'm just taking it day by day. As a recovered agoraphobic I worry about getting back out there in the future and hope my anxiety about going out isn't increased. I do get annoyed at people who do not adhere to the 2m rule and walk right by me on the street when I have no place to move. Its infuriating when people don't listen to the advice, today I saw people playing football in the park. Sometimes it's hard being stuck at home as you run out of things to do but I try to be productive, exercise and that's all we can do!
