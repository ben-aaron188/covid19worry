I'm sad about the deaths, but I'm trying to be practical about getting on with life. I'm getting very frustrated with people moaning about all of their new found free time whilst I'm trying to keep working and keep my colleagues safe. I'm worried for my older friends and family and what this all means for them. I'm hopeful that humanity will make it through this and be stronger for it at the other side. 

I'm now struggling to find 500 words! 

I'm trying to make the most of the time at home to read and to bake and enjoy the simpler things.
