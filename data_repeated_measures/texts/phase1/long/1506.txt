Well I'm on the last 3 episodes of the Office (American one), and, although there's a definite downslide in quality in the last couple seasons, the world is coming to an end. Their world, in the show. They will stop existing once the show finale concludes. And I welcome when the finale of the human race concludes. Planet earth deserves better.

And my response has to be at least 500 characters? But also only a few sentences. That is what you'd call a ""catch-22."" 500 characters is not found in only a few sentences. So now my feeling about the Corona situation is that, literally, everyone has lost their mind.
