I feel scared to go out. I wish everyone would abide by the government rules so it can all be over and we can get back to normal life. I miss my family massively. I am scared for my friends who work in the nhs. I have never followed the news more than I am now. I hope that if i or anyone else in my family gets the virus then we will be able to overcome it and that it doesnâ€™t put us in hospital needing treatment. My husband has no work because of the virus so it is already affecting us without us actually having it.
