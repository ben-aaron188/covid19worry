I feel very worried about the Corona situation at the moment. I feel very restless and can't settle to do anything or concentrate on watching anything as my anxiety is quite high. I have heard that up to 80% of the population will be infected so there is a good chance I will get it and not only the old and weak are the ones dying so it seems like a bit of a lottery as to who will survive and who will not. I miss visiting my family and friends although i do have family living with me so I am not completely alone.
