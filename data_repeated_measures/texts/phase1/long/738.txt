I am perhaps slightly concerned about catching coronavirus myself but I'm following all the advice such as staying at home, washing my hands thoroughly and only going out when necessary so think I should be ok. I use the news to keep up to date but try not to spend too much time thinking about this or being bombarded by the information. Perhaps compared to the average person I am feeling more relaxed about the situation because due to fatigue staying at home a lot is something I am used to and it doesn't unsettle me.
