i am a little worried because who woudnt be.At the start of the outbreak when people where not on a lockdown i was more worried about getting it but i fell more secure now that people are at there homes.being on lockdown for me is fine i dont get lonely and i can keep busy.Every now again after seeing a broadcast i do worry but i worry more for others than myself which isnt what i normally do.i havent had a moment of sadness and i am happy and relax but like i mention the worry does come now and again.My sleep and exercise and generl wellbeing is very good as i am taking extra care for myself.
