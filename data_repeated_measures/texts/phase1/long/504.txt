I'm stressed and feel helpless at the moment with my lack of income. My sources of work have dried up and we look to be getting very little help from the government, because we have savings to fall back on. Really makes you wonder why you are careful with your money and save when many others don't and just stick out their hands at times like these, so you could say I'm disappointed. Currently my family are symptom free and keeping as safe as possible, so that is a plus. I'm also disappointed with the people who are not following the stay at home guidance and making unnecessary journeys, I know a few of these people.
