I can't  help  but think of the dying people, and the people still going out, sun bathing having bbq it's hard. Knowing that these people are dying alone it's sad. Lots of us are trying to limit contact while doctors and nurses struggle to keep people  alive. And other don't seem to take it seriously because it's not likely to be  a big illness for them, which is debatable. I feel fearful  for the future  and how we come out of this without having another wave of it hit us and back to square one.
