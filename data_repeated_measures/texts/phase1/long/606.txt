About 15 minutes ago, the news broke about the prime minister being admitted to the ICU, so that was a shock and made it even more ""real"" to me than it already was. My anxiety has definitely increased, especially as I am high risk, but there isnt much I can do about it other than social distancing, intensive handwashing and trying not to touch my face. There have been reports of people ignoring the lockdown too, so that is adding to the stress of it. The increase of sinophobia I've been seeing on the internet, blaming Chinese people for the virus (mostly from Americans) is making me worry that there might be another pointless, stupid war that will kill millions.
