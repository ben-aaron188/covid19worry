I feel grateful that I am not suffering and thankful to all the people who are helping out. But itâ€™s frustrating seeing people deliberately assume the rules do not apply to them and continue to wander out and about, too close to people and more than once a day. It feels like we are not yet in the worst of it, and the actions of people feel like the government will have to take more severe actions soon. I am not looking forward to it but also limiting the amount I think about it as it is all so stressful.
