Disgusted by the poor leadership in this country. Acting far too late and far from prepared. They had been warned in early scientific studies ordered by gov that the UK would suffer in such a crisis and the report is buries. That incompetence is killing life's. We shouldn't be this underprepped.

Also very angry to those still going out and disgusting by the amount of selfishness/stupidity. However immense pride for the NHS, emergency services, retail staff and delivery drivers who are all very underpaid
