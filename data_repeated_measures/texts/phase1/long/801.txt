It's hard for me as I work in a hospital. All our clinical staff has been redeployed on to the dementia wards. So its out admin team who are the backbone of the service.Every day feels like groundhog day. More and more people diagnosed. It does not feel like there is an end in sight. All my favourite things have been cancelled, music, sport, events. Can't visit relatives, supermarkets busy, social distancing, no big gatherings. NHS overstretched. Using football grounds as hospitals. Asking footballers to take paycuts. Funding for lower ranked tennis players. Spending time at home in isolation. Domestic violence up 25%. prime minister has Covid 19.
