I feel anxiety and a sense of helplessness and dread. It’s difficult waiting for something awful to happen and not knowing when it will hit. I also feel cut off from others, despite the use of social media to keep in touch. It’s just not the same, and I am worried about security of Zoom etc. 
Still working, I feel fear of being in the office, perhaps with people who have the virus. I resent those who can work safely from home full time and choose to go out more than necessary. I feel huge gratitude to others keeping key services functioning but I find the restrictions on shopping difficult-one way systems in supermarkets are strange and feel awkward, and the shortage of some basics is infuriating.
