sadness that we havn't seen family for over a month,anxious about having no work and uncertain if we will have any money coming in over coming months and worried about the future, Listless do not really feel like putting an effort into anything. Annoyed at USA and some of the FB postings I see from American friends who really should be more aware and a little less wrapped up in themselves. it should be the world coming together to work out how to solve and help together.Instead it is everyone for themselves,
