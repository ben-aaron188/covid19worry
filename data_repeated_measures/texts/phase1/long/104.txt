I am worried about my family, especially my mum who has COPD and emphysema, and my elderly grandad. I am scared they will get the virus and die when I have not had chance to see them in person. I am sad for my children (my eldest has ASD) who are trying very hard to manage this situation. They are missing friends and school and I fear they may fall behind. I am busy during my days off trying to plan days for them to keep them busy, especially as my eldest likes a routine. I am a key worker (RMN) and am very worried I may catch the virus at work and bring it home. I am annoyed at the way some members of the public are disregarding the social distance rule which is potentially going to make this situation last longer for the rest of us and put more of us in danger. I miss my friends and family and the only people I speak to outside of my home are my work colleagues (this is actually quite good, as I would hate to be at home 24/7 with no one else to speak to other my chidlren and husband!). My husband is working from home and has had to turn a whole room into his ""office"".
