I feel like the day to day impact on myself is minimal. I’m still going to work but now need to look after my kids as we can’t get childcare after school.

I appreciate that I am very fortunate as many others are in terrible situations. Both myself and my wife are very busy at work as we are key workers. 

I’m mostly worried about the impact on business and how many are being furloughed without much consideration about how they might return to work. A few people from work have been off for a week or more with this and while I’m generally careful, I can’t vouch for the behaviour on others.
