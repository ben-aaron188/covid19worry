Very frightened. Scared of the unknown and how it could be caught by myself or my friends/family. Not knowing if the cough that I have is related to the pandemic or if it’s just a normal cough. Currently still in work albeit working from home. How long with this last for? Will my pay be effected soon? Will I loose my job? It seems a very small issue compared to all of the above but my health as in my weight and mental health. 
Anger. At the people that arnt listening. That are still out and about. If they aren’t following the rules of staying in I have no faith that they are washing their hands!
