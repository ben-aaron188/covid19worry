Feel worried about catching it or passing it on to someone else. Feel worried about going out the house. Feel concerned how long this will go on for - can’t go on forever and feel nervous about staying in the house all the time (although am doing so). Worried about income as that has dropped for me so added worry about how long we will be in lockdown. Feel angry that people aren’t sticking with the lockdown and could mean we can’t go out for exercise
Every time you get a sore throat or anything you feel worried in case it’s Coronavirus
