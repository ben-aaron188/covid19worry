i am scared my anxiety is through the roof as i am a vulnerable person. I am angry at people that are not listening or taking heed of the goverment advice and guidelines. I am scare of what this means for the world now how different things will be in the future. I am anxious that a vaccine will not be found soon enough . 
I am angry that vulnerable adults are being asked and may not get ventilation should they need it die to a lack of ventilators. I am worried what it means for our children they are missing out on so much both ediication seeing their freinds etc.
