I feel annoyed at the people who are not following the Government guidelines to stay at home and to only go out once for a small amount of exercise close to home. I can't understand why they are disregarding this instruction and going out and sunbathing in parks etc.  We are following the guidelines. We are both around the 60 age mark and in good health. I'm hoping that we don't get the virus or, if we do, it will just be a mild version. I am hopeful that the death rate will start to reduce over the next week.
