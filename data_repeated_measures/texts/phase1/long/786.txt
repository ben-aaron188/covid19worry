I am scared sick of it and think I will die. it's awful as I keep thinking I have symptoms and I'm a key worker which scare me more. The media is making it worse, I can't watch the news and I worry about it in case I die. I am scared for my children and worry about their future without me. I am scared for my elderly mother, she has medical problems and is nearly 90 and I haven't been able to see her. My father has died so I am dealing with that too. It isn't helped by not having support, just me and my children, no family to help. I haven't been out for over two weeks.
