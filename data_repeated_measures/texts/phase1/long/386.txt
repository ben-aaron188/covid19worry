It's a slightly worrying situation especially to see so many people from around the world die. But personally, I am not that worried as I am following the guidelines. Making sure to stay productive and active as well which has helped with my mental/physical health. It was a bit stressful at the start of the lockdown (UK) but I have gotten used to it at this point. Can't wait for it to end though as some proper fresh air and outdoor activities would be nice especially with the warm weather. I'm slightly optimistic that we will all behave differently after this all ends as well. Maybe start paying health care and other essential workers properly and treating them well too.
