The unknown of it all is quite disconcerting and I really miss seeing my loved ones which has led me to feel more down than I usually would. I also have a loved one in the high risk group leading to greater worry. I do feel very fortunate though as I have a lovely garden to get some fresh air in an outside space and I'm making good use of online contact which punctuates the days and weeks with some valuable communication. I'm fairly productive at home and getting a range of tasks done, so feeling a reasonable sense of purpose and enjoying a short walk in my local area most days.
