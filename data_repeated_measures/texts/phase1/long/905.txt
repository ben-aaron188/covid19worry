There's a slight sense of worry since there's a suspicion that this might not be a one time thing. The virus could mutate and come back even worse on a seasonal basis. Overall though I think it's likely there will be a vaccine within a year or so. It will be interesting to see how all of this social distancing influences behaviour once it is all over, and how easy it will be to return to normal. It might also be interesting to see how long this will take. I can't imagine a world where everything is back to normal any time soon. Some unsavoury characters might even tryo to take advantage of the situation.
