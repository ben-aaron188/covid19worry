I am worried about the virus being passed on to my family. Both myself and partner are front line nhs workers and are in contact with patients who have tested positive. We worry about bringing it home with us and passing it on. I am also frustrated that some people seem to think that the social distancing rules do not apply to them. I have one neighbour who had visitors at the weekend but thinks it is ok as they do not have any symptoms so are unlikely to catch it. We all need to work together to defeat this and some peoples selfish actions put this at risk making me frustrated and angry.
