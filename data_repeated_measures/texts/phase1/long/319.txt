I am very tense about the corona situation. I am worried for my loved ones and my friends, I don’t want anything and to happen to them. I am scared to leave the house and when I absolutely have to I do it as quickly as possible. I want life to go back to normal. I don’t want to be scared of contact with people. I want to be free to go where I want. I’m scared that I will become infected and infect my family. I don’t believe people are taking this seriously and that the police need to do more to protect us. This lockdown is scary but needed.
