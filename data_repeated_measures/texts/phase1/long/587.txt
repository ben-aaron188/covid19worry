Some people are still very ignorant about what this virus is.  They just don't understand how important it is to isolate. The government has to impose a complete lock down immediately to protect everyone. I'm scared for my family at this time. I miss them and am afraid that I won't be able to go to my brother's wedding in August if the quarantine is extended because of stupid people ignoring basic guidance. It makes me so angry and frustrated that some people think they're exempt from the rules.
