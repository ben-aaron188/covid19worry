I’m worried for my family in they getting corona and are taken very ill. My husband is a key worker and I’m worried about him going to work each day. I’m concerned about what will happen when this ends. I’m unsure about when this will end and how people will come with going out again. I miss my family and friends and about keeping everyone safe. I enjoy my time with my family being so close and being able to play games with them and go on walks and runs and hope that this doesn’t change as this would increase my anxiety further. I feel very lucky to have a safe house.
