I feel sad about the whole situation. Having heard the UK PM is now in intensive care, it hits home that it can affect anyone and everyone.

I'm annoyed with China for hiding the real scale of the issue, this has prevented other countries from reacting quickly to contain the virus.

I worry about my job; I hope the company stays afloat to enable me to return to work. I am currently furloughed, so I will have a lot of free time on my hands.

I hope all of my family the best health to beat this virus!
