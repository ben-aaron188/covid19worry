Angry at the way the government has treated the NHS over the past ten years thus when it comes to a pandemic it is not prepared so what they now have to do is throw money into it and claim they could not foresee this. Correct they could not but the NHS would have been much more prepared if it was funded correctly prior to this. I am also angry at the way some of our population is ignoring social distancing despite multiple pleas from NHS workers, however, not as angry as I am with the current government.
