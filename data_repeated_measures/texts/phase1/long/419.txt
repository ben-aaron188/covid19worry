I am currently working from home so know that I am in a privileged position financially but it is really tough not having physical contact with my colleagues. I am starting To get angry about the people who are not taking the restrictions in place seriously as in the long term it will not do the country any favours in fighting this virus. I am also starting to feel anxious when going out as I am concerned that I will pick up the virus and spread it to my loved ones in the household who are classed as vulnerable.
