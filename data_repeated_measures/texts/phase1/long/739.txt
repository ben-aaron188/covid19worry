At this very moment I feel frustrated, because I have just been sent home from work (having been self-isolating for 2 weeks already due to a cough) for borderline raised temperature. I will have full pay, but I am a nurse and have no way of knowing if I have had (or currently have) COVID-19. I am frustrated that I cannot help at work when they really need all the help they can get, and I am frustrated at the idea of another week alone without being allowed to leave my home.

I'm writing some more words here because my response needs to be at least 500 characters...
