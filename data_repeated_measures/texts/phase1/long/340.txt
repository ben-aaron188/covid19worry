I am feeling really anxious about the whole situation, both because of anxiety surrounding possibly getting Covid-19 and being very unwell and because of the changes to our way of life.  I don't cope with change of any sort, even small things like a weekly appointment at a regular time being altered and there have been so many changes that I am unable to cope.  This has caused my anxiety  levels to increase to levels I haven't known for years.  The anxiety is also preventing me from going out.  I have a terrible feeling of fear as well, about what the future holds.  I think that this is making me feel that something bad is about to happen all the time and is having a knock on effect on my level of anxiety.
