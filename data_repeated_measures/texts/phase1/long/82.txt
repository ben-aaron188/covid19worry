I am worried about work and I miss normal life (childcare, seeing friends and family, school, routine)

It is tough to think about the daily death toll and to also know that there are many people flaunting lockdown and not taking it seriously.

I am struggling with the lack of routine with my child at home and the effect this is having on my mental health, but I am not sure how to start fixing this. Everyone is in the same boat but I do think that I am not dealing very well with it.

Having said that, I am taking pleasure in small things that I probably wouldn't have considered pre-lockdown, such as gardening.
