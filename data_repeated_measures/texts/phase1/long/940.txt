I feel angry at people not taking the situation seriously, and those who are ignoring government advice. But I also feel anxious about how long this will last, and whether the situation will get better at any point. There is also a sense of fear about potentially getting the virus at some point. Really it is a bit of a jumble of emotions, and sometimes I feel guilty for being anxious when there are people on the front line putting themselves to real danger to help us all in this time. It is a very weird situation to be in at the moment.
