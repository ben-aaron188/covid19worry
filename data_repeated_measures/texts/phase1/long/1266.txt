I have mixed feelings. I feel anxious about my mum getting it as she is older and vulnerable. I feel very anxious if I go out to the shop as everything is just so strange. I'm very sad for my children missing school, especially as they are in their first year (Reception) so I'm really sad that they most likely won't get to finish the year. But, I am quite enjoying the time at home with my family. It is quite relaxed and I''m enjoying homeschooling my children most of the time. Sometimes I do find it difficult to get my motivation up though.
