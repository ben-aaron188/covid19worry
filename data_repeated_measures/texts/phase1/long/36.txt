I am pleased that people have stopped panic buying but all this stuff going on with the US stealing masks destined from other countries isnâ€™t constructive at all. I am still relatively relaxed about the situation, but I have switched to online shopping but still try to get out when I need something essential but I just go into the garden for some exercise. I think the peak should come soon, and I, like many others, will most definitely be looking into holidays and trips for afterwards. When it does all finish, I hope people will support local business as much as possible.
