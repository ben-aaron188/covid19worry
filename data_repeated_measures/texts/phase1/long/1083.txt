There are a lot of fears and anxiety around coronavirus and how long it will last for - with so many rumours and much hearsay about it, it can be hard to believe what is truth and what is media panic. Personally, I have a lot of fear around it. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was reported that it mostly affected the elderly but now so many people of varying ages are losing their battle with it. It's a very worrying time, especially if you are high risk and vulnerable. Also with regards to mental health, isolating can have a very detrimental effect on mental health
