I don't feel that the lockdown was the appropriate response.  I am unhappy that  I'm unable to see my boyfriend, friends or family.  It is an anxious and stressful situation and it is made worse by the isolation, as you are unable to go an visit the people you would usually turn to for support. I am not scared of catching it I am more worried about my own mental health and wellbeing due to isolation than I am about catching coronavirus but I understand the issue is elderley/vurnerable people.
