It is a weird, scary time. But some people are not following advice which makes me angry. I am concerned about various family members who are classed as vulnerable. I feel the government is only doing the bare minimum, there are plenty more things they could do. I feel sorry for the frontline healthcare workers are fighting this as i do not feel they are protected enough.  Its frustrating to be on lockdown but i think in the long term it is the safest thing to do. More lives will be saved and the burden on the nhs will subside.
