I'm very angry at the Conservative government for placing the economy above the lives of the poor and vulnerable, and terrified of the effect coronavirus will have on other countries with a less stable healthcare system and on refugees, people without access to healthcare and homeless people. I am also concerned about my own family. I am also sad about being confined to my flat and not being able to go about my day to day life and see my friends. I am angry that the media are not holding the government to account and concerned at the conspiracy theories cropping up and being spread on social media.
