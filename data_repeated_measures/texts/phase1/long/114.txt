I'm finding it a little more bearable than a week ago, because there is not quite so much overload of scary information and situations getting exponentially more dramatic - BUT still preoccupied every minute of the day because of the threat to myself and those I know in my age group. So whereas at the start I was wanting to communicate with friends and family, making sure they were ok and being sensible, now it's the getting through it stage. And that is fairly dull and saddening, thinking of all the things in life one is missing out on, on a beautiful warm day in the country.

But let's be clear, the real anxiety-inducing factor is when the politicians and their advisors look like screwing up. I was completely panicked when they talked glibly about the herd immunity strategy, because it was obviously a mass experiment without informed consent. And every day I try not to watch the 5pm briefing, because the performance of Raab, Whitty, Harris etc makes me even more concerned they are inadequate to deal with a national emergency. And that makes me anxious again. I was quite calm today until I caught a few minutes of their latest performance. Some of those mentioned above would be overpromoted if they were in charge of a bank branch in a small provincial town.
