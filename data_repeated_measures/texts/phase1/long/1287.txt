Scared and worried for my children
Annoyed now one is listening and still goes out to socialise
Missing my family like crazy talking on the phone just ain't the same 
Confused with everything going on as someone said one thing and others say another
Trying to stay off social media as that makes things 10 times worse than what it is.
Wondering when everything can return to normal as my daughter is missing school and her friends.

Would like it if someone could explain everything to me in a non scary way as everything I'm reading and seeing and hearing makes me feel even more scared and my anxiety is through the roof
