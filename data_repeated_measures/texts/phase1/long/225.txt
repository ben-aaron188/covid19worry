I've been unwell with breathlessness, cough and Temperature for nearly three weeks. Have had phone contact with doctors who have said I'm not bad enough to be in hospital yet. I'm terrified of getting worse suddenly or of my children getting ill. The uncertainty of what to expect from the illness is terrifying. I'm also worried about what will happen to us in the longer term if we survive. It's such a frightening and difficult time. Even rich and famous people can't escape it and the best healthcare doesn't seem to mean anything, people still die. But I'm also worried if I don't have it now, what if I catch it, how will I fight it after having been so ill.
