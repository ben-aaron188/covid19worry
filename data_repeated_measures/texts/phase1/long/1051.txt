A little worried about how long this situation will go on for, wanting to get back to normality, hoping that the numbers of people dying each day will start to go down soon, and hoping that people will listen to the advice and stay inside as much as possible. I feel grateful that my family is safe and healthy and proud of the NHS in this country. I’m trying not to watch the news too much or spend too long on social media as there is too much incorrect information and conspiracy theories which don’t help my mindset.
