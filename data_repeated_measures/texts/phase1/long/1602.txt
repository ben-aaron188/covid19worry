While still generally anxious about the situation, at this very moment I feel relatively calm. I have been very up and down during lockdown and can go from feeling OK in the morning to very worried, sad or anxious by the afternoon. I read about some nurses and a surgeon who died this morning and that made me feel really sad and worried for staff that are on the front line. I have periods of extreme worry about older relatives but don't worry so much about me or my husband getting it. I have been angry about people who are flouting the rules. I find the whole thing very surreal.
