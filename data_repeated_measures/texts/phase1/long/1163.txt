I feel extremely anxious that I and my immediate family will catch the virus. I am also very concerned for some of my friends who are on the frontline in the hospitals.
Also I am concerned for my financial future when we get through this as being self employed i have no current income , and dont know how this will affect my business going forward.
I feel very sad for families who are going through grief and bereavement now too , and for the people who are unable to visit loved ones , or to say final goodbyes for their family members who are dying alone in hospital.
