I am very worried about my family (husband and children of 12 and 9) catching it along with my elderly parents aged 73 and 79.  They live 100 miles away so I can't see them to drop off food and they are not online so it's been hard arranging food drop offs for them.  I ring them each day; they are sounding quite depressed with all the restrictions and are worried too.  We are following all the government guidelines on staying home, I have only been out twice in two weeks to stock up on things I cannot get delivered like milk and bread (unable to get food delivered and milk man is not taking on new customers).  I'm also trying to keep up with the news but am trying to relax more as I've found all the news so worrying and it's affected my sleeping.  I have been waking up during the night and stressing.  I do not have any symptoms of Corona neither do my family but I have been monitoring all of us.
