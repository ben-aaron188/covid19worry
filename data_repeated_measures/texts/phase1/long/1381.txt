I'm honestly quite worried and scared, I know people who have passed away, some who weren't even that old, and it's really worrying. We have stayed home and not even been out for food shopping as it has been delivered. I miss my family and friends and some days it's taking a toll on my mental health. I'm trying to keep active doing workouts and making sure I spend time in the garden to get fresh air. I can't wait for it all to be over and we can go back to normal. It's made me realise how never to take anything for granted.
