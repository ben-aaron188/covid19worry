Worried about how bad the death toll is going to be, how this will impact on vulnerable people in society. Worried about how we will pay for this later on as nothing the Tories ever do is for the good of the people and will be us normal people who repay. Sadness for everyone who has been impacted. Anger at those ignoring the social distancing rules. I am anxious and want to know when life will get back to normal. It is a very uncertain time and I am so grateful for all the key workers doing their daily work and putting themselves in the firing line.
