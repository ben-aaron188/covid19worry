My mum is a front-line worker and so I am perpetually anxious about her and my family contracting the virus. I'm extremely worried about my chances of survival if I contract it as I am chronically ill. I'm also deathly worried for my parents, who aren't really in the most at-risk age group but are still 'older' and my father has a history of strokes. It kind of feels like an inevitability that we will contract it and feeling like someone (or possible multiple of people in my family) could die feels like a mind-numbing reality. I feel like I'm sitting around waiting to die all the time. 

In general the situation feels bleak. I feel like I have the most sympathy and concern for still-developing countries and refugees who are either displaced or people from war-torn countries. What hope do they have. The knock-on effects from this on a global scale will be so painful.
