The hardest part is not being able to do the simple things, as a university student I liked going into uni, attending lectures, seeing my friends, having a study session at the SU. None of this is possible now, and it's hard to do it online and from home. As the weather has been getting better it's hard to play sports with friends, go to the beach or even do exercise cause all the gyms are closed. Spending more time with my partner is a positive however.

Oftentimes I find myself bored, sick of social media, and struggling to find something to do.
