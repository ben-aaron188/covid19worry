The current corona situation is very uncertain.  I currently donÂ´t really know how I am feeling as my life has changed quite a bit as to how it used to be. I am a final year university student who has had to move back home due to it, I have assignments to complete and feel incredibly unmotivated about the remainder of my studies. To add to this, I also feel rather exhausted, probably because I am not being as active as I usually would be. I am fearful that this will become an unhealthy habit. I am however prosperous about the future and believe that people will become nicer due to this situation.
