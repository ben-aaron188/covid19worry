Worried about family and friends, especially parents , when hearing about the many deaths in Italy and Spain and some anxiety about there not being enough hospital beds / respirators or the NHS not being able to cope should someone from my family or friends fall seriously ill. Not worried about a lack of groceries or toilet paper.
A bit guilty for not getting a lot of work done as I am still paid full time. The task of educating children prevents me from working as much as I think I should.
As an introvert, I am not bothered by the social distancing measures. I feel most comfortable at home anyway and it is a relief having an excuse not to have to socialise.
