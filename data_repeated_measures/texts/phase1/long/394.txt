i am feeling very anxious about other people but relaxed about myself. this bout of corona i've had it twice in 4 weeks and i've been taken out hard the second time very hard. as a young person i feel for the vulnerable people. I am really dissatisfied at the game being played by crooked politicians as Mr Trump refers to them - here in the uk with snail pace response. I was alot more cavalier to start with but got apprehensive as i experienced it myself . i am relaxed and axious for others. I am really agry at the rip off price gouging merchants - i am in business this is a time to support the people not rip them off.
