i feel mostly comfortable in my own company, although it is irritating to see others in society ignoring the lockdown rules which are designed to save lives, and frustrating that there is so much ambiguity in the instructions which makes it easy for people to justify making trips. I don't think exterior wall paint is a basic necessity, for example.

bizarrely, i'm in an odd situation where i still live with my ex, so despite being friends the relationship becomes more strained. i'm also involved with a married woman and it's incredibly frustrating to only have online contact with her, especially when others think it's acceptable to visit their second home against their own advice!
