I'm going to have a baby in six weeks, coronavirus or not. But the current global health situation is affecting everything about that, and I don't know how to feel positive about bringing a new life into he world as it is at the moment. I'm resignedly self isolating, as is my husband, my work has vanished but happily his has not. We are both anxious about getting enough food, about the amount of hospital appointments I have where I may catch it, how you cough when you have a baby nestling against your lungs fighting for space. 


We'll almost certainly get it eventually, but hope to at least get past the birth first.
