It just all so stressful. The virus fallout has disrupted my life, I'm out of pocket & have rent arrears. Getting normal supplies/groceries is a near constant frazzling battle. I'm quite worried about how to resolve these problems, especially as I'm unlikely to get a better-paid job now. I live with my disabled mother who's over 60 so that's another cause for concern for me. On a bigger scale, the global death toll is so saddening. The amount of lives & jobs & families & businesses it's disrupted is astonishing. It makes me frustrated, concerned, unhappy, and exasperated in equal measure.
