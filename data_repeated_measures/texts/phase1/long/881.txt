I am concerned about the length of time we will be asked to stay indoors and how long children will be off school. I imagine how it will be to be able to go shopping again and have everything back to normal. 
I am not happy to only be allowed out once per day I feel very trapped indoors all the time as I have no garden. Its worrying about the older generation but I feel we should be able to be outside more than we currently are. I speak to my family much more often via video chat apps since this all begun which is a positive
