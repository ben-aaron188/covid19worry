I've been feeling anxious lately due to the pandemic and mostly I'm worried about how the economy will be affected, and how the younger generation will be affected as their school lives have been disturbed heavily, worried for my nephews. 
It's been hard trying to buy food and essentials as everyone is being stupid and panic buying, especially toilet paper out of all things which i really don't understand. Hopefully in a few months things will be a bit more normal because attempting to live as normal these days is quite impossible.
