Its frustrating that people are continuing to go out despite warnings and risks. I'm nervous that I and people I care about will catch it if people continue to ignore warnings and go out. People that continue to go out when completely unnecessary represent the worst of our society in my opinion and further restrictions should be put in place to deter these people and punish them when or if they breach the rules.  Its a very serious situation and people aren't taking it seriously, especially America that has a huge population that aren't receiving treatment quickly enough. Governments need to do more to protect and care for its citizens.
