Iâ€™m feeling very neutral towards it currently. The positives of the daily death count reducing is a good sign, however we are not out of the woods as cases are still developing and at the end of the day, people are still dying somewhat unnecessarily. 
People seem to be adhering to the guidelines which is showing progress but the effects of the lockdown are effecting mental health while protecting physical health. 
All I feel we can do is sit at home at wait for it all to be over and try and make the best of the situation.
