I feel if more restrictions were to be imposed the public might actually follow instructions.  Currently instructions are not exactly followed by everyone, perhaps orders and rules might work.  Problems arising in that case would be to Police the orders.  I really feel there should be stricter rules imposed, perhaps a sort of curfew might help.  We need to get this thing done.  The sooner the better.  I am co corned about the impact on the economy.  I feel that the frontline staff especially nurses should have been priority in tests for Covid-19.  Sadly it appears that they have not been priority.  Grave error.
