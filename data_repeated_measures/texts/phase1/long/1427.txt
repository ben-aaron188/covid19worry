The Covid-19 has made me feel Lonely and sad, i miss my friends and family, i miss going out, i miss normality. 
I want this to be over. 
I feel sad for the people this has affected and i worry that it will affect those i love.
I worry for my job which will impact my mortgage etc.
The whole thing opens up your eyes and makes you realise you should not to take things for granted.
I pray this does not hurt many more people and that people stay home so that this virus can dissapear as soon as possible
