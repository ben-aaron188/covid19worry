I am quite frustrated as I want life to return to normal as soon as possible. I am really hoping some restrictions are lifted in time for my birthday in the middle of May so I can have some form of celebration for it. I'm also frustrated as the weather is nice the next few days but we can't enjoy it properly. I am also hopeful that the UK will soon reach the peak of the outbreak as predicted as I think this would boost the country's morale. I am also trying to cope with my university studies being entirely online for the summer term, which I might find difficult. I hope I'm allowed to return to university as normal in September.
