I do not find the isolation difficult. I am one of those people that does not mind my own company. It won't last forever. I do like to sit outside a cafe and watch the world go by, but I can wait. I worry about my partner who goes out to work every day in a nursing home. He has diabetes and has had angina. Fingers crossed. We have Mums, both aged 92. They are staying in of course. Getting an online grocery shop is the most frustrating aspect. But I usually get there in the end. I just wish people would obey the rules and then we might get through this quicker. All in all, it's something we just have to get through.
