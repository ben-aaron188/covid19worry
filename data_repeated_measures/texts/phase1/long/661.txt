It's been a very difficult and stressful situation, in extremely unprecedented circumstances. The uncertainty for now and for the future is unsettling. It is illuminating the class divide and all its injustices, the disgusting underfunding of the NHS and the poor pay of what are now essential workers. Life and society will change forever. I feel stressed and worried about people getting ill, being able to get food and drugs and how this will work out for the future. The Government is woefully underperforming, putting us all in danger. So many people are out of touch. The government are scapegoating anyone other than those who should be guilty.
