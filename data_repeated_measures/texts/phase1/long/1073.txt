Whilst I haven't been directly affected, I worry for people working in essential services and the general state of the world at the moment - there is a lot of uncertainty and worry as we don't know what will happen next. People are losing jobs and stability in their lives and there is no cure yet so we don't know when things will return to normal, if they even do. Life may never look the same again. Mental health is beyond breaking point for a lot of people and others are blatantly disobeying government guidance which will delay normality further.
