This situation makes me feel very anxious as I am looking after my elderly and vulnerable father who lives independently but needs care as he is shielding. I am not anxious for myself, just the fact that I could pass this on to him and others. I also worry for my sister who is on the front line within the NHS and is still awaiting appropriate PPE and to be tested. I am also concerned about our economic future as a country and wonder how this will affect us long term in terms of job security. Another anxiety of mine is the children who are vulnerable at home.
