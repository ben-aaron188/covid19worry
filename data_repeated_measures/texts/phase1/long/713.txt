I’m worried. About infection reaching my family, particularly my high risk vulnerable dad. 

I’m worrying about money. I’ve lost most/all of my self employed projects, and the fear of how long this is going to go on for is enormous.

I’m sad. I miss my friends. I miss having a hug. 

I’m currently classed as a part-time key worker in a supermarket, but customers aren’t completely adhering to the social distancing rules and it gets me very nervous. I can’t afford to not work. I fear for my family, and should anyone get ill, would it be my fault? 

I suffer from a few chronic conditions myself, so I’m not entirely sure how I would even survive the virus to be honest. I’m previously diagnosed with contamination/health OCD, so I’m pretty impressed with how I’m handling things so far.
