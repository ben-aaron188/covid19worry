I'm disgusted and angry at the worst of the leadership and selfish human behaviour I am hearing about, particularly in the US.

But as an introvert who has suffered constant anxiety, particularly social anxiety, I am finding myself feeling more relaxed, resilient, creative, at peace and confident than I have felt previously.

I am coping better than some of my peers because I have had to develop strategies to cope with anxiety - they are now a part of my habits and I see the Coronavirus crisis as a confirmation that those strategies work, and that I am more resilient than I realised. I am also able to help others during this crisis and feel useful to be able to share my calm and sense of hope with others.
