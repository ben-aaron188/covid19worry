I am, fluctuating between feeling calm and carrying on at home day to day with tasks and looking after my children and husbandm but then there are moments when I get very anxious when I watch the news and hear about others around me. I cant help think about the sadness of others and the worry for the future. I worry to for my extended families health and for all our financial future . I worry now when I hear about the prime minister, but then I do get a little comfort to hear China is doing better and life is getting back to normality
