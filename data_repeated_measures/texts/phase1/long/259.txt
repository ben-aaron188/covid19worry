I feel like people are not taking it seriously enough and as a result are not abiding to reccomendations like they should. I feel like there is a lot of people passing away that could have been prevented and additionally China are hiding information from us and should be punished as a result. It will be interesting to see what happens the months following on from Corona and how the country and world will change as a result from it. I have enjoyed the time off though and people should take the postives from it rather than only looking at the negatives
