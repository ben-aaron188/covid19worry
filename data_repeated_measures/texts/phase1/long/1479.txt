My mood changes with the news of the day. Today I am a little more optimistic especially as the number of infections has dropped dramatically. I am not daft enough to show too much hope though as they could easily go up again. Last night I was very sad when I heard the PM had been taken to hospital. It also damaged my morale and I think if we were to lose him the country as a whole would take quite a hit.  I am fearful but try to keep that in check with logic. If the usual flu season casulaties were reported in the same way as this virus has, the figures would be much more scary. If flu was a notifiable disease then we would have lockdown just about every year.
