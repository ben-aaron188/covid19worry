My current situation is fine because I'm an introverted person. My uni life has been disrupted but online lectures and assignments means it's not a huge issue. I also don't miss having to go to a boring part time job every afternoon and money isn't a huge worry for me. I'm young so I'm not scared of getting it myself, but I live with someone with a weak immune system so I'm definitely scared for them. Food has been a concern too and it's a shame to not be able to just walk down to the shops to grab a snack or something similar. I am angry at the government because 10 years of austerity and right-wing incompetence has made this issue far worse but lots of people aren't making that link. The NHS needs better funding, our public services need to be appreciated, things have got to change.
