i am worried, not for myself but for the future of my family members jobs. i am also worried for my elderly grandparents as they are at risk of getting much worse symptoms then people who are younger. i am also worried for the future of my country as although i do not agree with tory polacies dominic raab is no where as good as boris johnson. raab will be much stricter on people and make more cuts to the nhs. my parents are much more worried then me and i'm not sure if thats me not understanding the situation or them overreacting and that makes me very uneasy
