Quite relaxed being at home with the children although we get a bit stressed when having to venture out shopping. Very worried for our older children who are a nurse and a prison officer. This is something everyone needs to be conscious about and do their bit. Its annoying seeing so many people out for walks, we have even seen kids going fishing. Their parents should be fined and taught to be more responsible, no excuses. Not happy with the herd immunity situation the government put us is, endangering so many and causing so many avoidable deaths
