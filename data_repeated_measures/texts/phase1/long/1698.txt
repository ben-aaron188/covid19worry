I feel out of control. Overwhelmed by this situation. Overwhelmed by news about it in social media and other information channels. I feel highly anxious. I feel if restrictions would be stricter, we could deal with the situation faster. I feel not well informed. I feel lost and scared. I'm worried. I'm slightly angry with people who still don't take this situation seriously. I'm tired and I think that it will be even worse. I have constant negative thoughts and I cannot focus on anything else. I am worrying about the future, about tomorrow, this week... I'm worried about next month and next few months.
