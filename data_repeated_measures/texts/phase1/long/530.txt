Currently, I am feeling fine - no symptoms and I am continuing to only leave the house for essentials. I am not sad nor happy about COVID-19, it's just something that has happened and we can do nothing about it until it has passed - if everyone complies with government advice then things won't get any worse. There ARE positives though - wildlife and nature are in a MUCH MUCH BETTER place thanks to less human interference/pollution. I personally could get very used to the idea of long term social distancing.
