I am concerned for my family members and more vulnerable people I know, less concerned for myself. I know that I am lucky being able to work from home. I am concerned about what this will do to the NHS. I am finding the lockdown fine but concerned if daily exercise is stopped this may no longer be the case. I am very annoyed at those who are constantly flouting the rules. A few people not following the rules means that the whole country will have to suffer. Seeing people sat in parks etc is very annoying and I am glad the police are taking it seriously.
