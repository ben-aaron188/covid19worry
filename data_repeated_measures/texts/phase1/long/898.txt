I don't feel anything strong at this exact moment but I'm nervous about the death toll still rising and I'm worried about the quarantine lasting potentially until the end of May. I have exams to study for and I miss my friends a lot. I have had my therapy and piano sessions cancelled due to Covid-19 so I am finding it difficult to stay on track. I am worried about if we as a society will learn from this pandemic as well and how long it will be until the next pandemic. I am starting to get cabin fever from being at home too much.
