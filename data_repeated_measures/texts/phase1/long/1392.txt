I feel like there’s a lot of uncertainty which is really troubling. I’m also concerned as I’ve been shielding due to an underlying health condition and this is worrying. I worry rather a lot by how long this pandemic is going to lost, the overall impact on the economy, jobs that will be lost, peoples lives that will be affected of of course and possibly more important than anything else, the lives that will be lost because of this terrible pandemic.

I feel for all the healthcare professionals doing a sterling job to keep people safe and well. I feel that they’re doing a fabulous job but it’s fire fighting at its best as I do not feel we are at the height of the pandemic just yet and the situation will get worse before it’s better.
