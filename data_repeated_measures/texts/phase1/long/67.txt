I feel very annoyed about having my freedom taken away. I am sick of being stuck at home with my children. I think itâ€™s an over reaction. I feel the huge loss of jobs, the crumbling economy and the impact on cancer patients not getting treated, is just so we can stop eighty year olds from getting the virus and potentially dying. The elderly and those with underlying health conditions should stay home rather than the entire country. People should be given the choice. How long can this go on for and when are we getting an exit date?
