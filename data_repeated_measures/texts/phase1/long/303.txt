I’m scared that someone I or someone I love will be affected by coronavirus. Our family financial situation is in turmoil, and that makes me anxious. I get annoyed by people who aren’t taking it seriously. I’m not sure that there’s any real way to stop the coronavirus and I worry that we’re going to be left in a situation where everyone has to catch it and they either get over it or they don’t. Mostly, I’m a knot of fear and anxiety, and it feels like things will never go back the way they were.
