At the moment I feel really stressed. This is mostly because of my mum, who has been in isolation for 3 weeks and is 77 this summer. I worry that she will get sick, not from the corona virus but from something else, and I will not be able to get treatment for her. I wake up in the middle of the night worrying that things will never get back to normal for any of us. I don't miss work because I hate my job but the lack of normal routine is having an effect on my mental health. I am trying to keep healthy by exercising each day but it is a real struggle. I can't believe I am living this. The terrible news each day and the losses people have to endure is unreal. How can someone survive having a child one day and knowing that they are being buried alone the next?
