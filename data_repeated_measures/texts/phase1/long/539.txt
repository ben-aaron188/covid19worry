Very Very anxious about work, about juggling family life, about my kids missing out on their lives. It’s impossible to juggle everything and stay sane. We’ve lost our first holiday in 2 years to this, and we can not afford another holiday and we’ve lost all our money on it. I’m Desperate to get outside properly and interact with family and friends. I’m totally sick of this shit situation. I think there’s a point that the economic fall out will be worse than the virus and I’m very anxious about what the future holds financially. I’m worried about my parents health but not about mine. I wish there was a way to tell who’s had it so life can return to normal.
