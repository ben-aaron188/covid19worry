Whilst i feel not particularly worried about catching virus as both me and dad who live with abide by rules. 
I am annoyed with people not taking the virus seriousm or the social distancing that has been put in place. I feel tired and drained with it all going on though as always wondering what the next problem will be or where to get food from. I worry that having to travel to many shops to get basics or wait in long queues increases my risk of catching or passing to my dad.
I suffer anxiety and depression and do not like not been able to go out but know is for best and will be happy the sooner it is under control.
