I am loving working from home - it was the break from the office I needed and I am gutted that I will have to go back to work soon. I have been able to save money and also focus on what I really want to achieve in life and I love having clear goals for the future. I am enjoying spending all my time at home as I get to spend time with my two year old - it feels like I am on maternity leave again. But I am worried about catching the virus and passing it onto loved ones when the lockdown is over and how it will impact on my job in the longterm.
