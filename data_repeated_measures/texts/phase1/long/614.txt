i feel like nothing will ever be the same again and that humans will take a long time to get back to some form of normality.
I am fearful for my parents health and wellbeing and it is very frustrating not seeing friends.
i am hoping that humans will learn a lesson from this and fund the correct things in the future, like research, medicine, hospitals etc.
I have seen the best of and the worst of the human spirit recently with a rise in crime =s like theft from the poor but also seen some great volunteers out there helping those in need.
