I feel hopeless of the measures that the government is currently using. There is still no face masks for general public since the WHO started to say it is useful for protecting lives from the coronavirus. If the government said that because there is not enough masks available, they can build more factorys to produce tons of masks for everybody use. Please stop risking the public. If not using masks for general public, I don't think you can stop the coronavirus spreading between people. it will become a deadly bug forever.
