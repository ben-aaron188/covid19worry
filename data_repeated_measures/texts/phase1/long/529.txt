I am on maternity leave with my 6 month old daughter and currently parenting alone. I am incredibly anxious and worried. My mental health is suffering as I relied on going out to see family and attend classes several times a week to keep me sane! I am just thankful that at least my daughter hadn't started nursery yet so there was no change in routine for her.

I am also concerned about when the lockdown will be lifted as I am trying to arrange going back to work in June and have no idea what kind of childcare will be available
