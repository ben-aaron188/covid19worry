I'm extremely anxious and concerned about the current situation in the UK regarding the Coronavirus. Some people just don't seem to understand what staying home is and what the implications of them staying out sunbathing in a park or visiting their mates are. People are stupid and inconsiderate and it's a very tough feeling because you're stuck at home feeling helpless and waiting for this all to pass. Also, I am in panic every time I go to the shops and see there's a lot of things missing in the shelves. I'm also extremely concerned about my work and the livelihood of my job as so many people are being made redundant or are being furloughed. This has resulted in some sleepless nights.
