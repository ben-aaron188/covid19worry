Generally relaxed. Nervous about what this means for the future and anxious about my older relatives. Other than that, I'm in a fortunate position and have little to worry about. I'm lucky enough that no one in my family has lost their job and no one has contracted it. I feel empathy for those in essential jobs or those who's financial situation is compromised because of this. I feel anxious when I am outside and around the public. Other than that, I'm happy to stay home until this is over. The only anger I feel is towards people who aren't willing to comply and putting others in danger.
