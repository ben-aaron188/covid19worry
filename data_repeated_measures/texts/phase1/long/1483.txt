I find my mood changes very rapidly - at present I am feeling more relief (as my father is just home from hospital after contracting the virus) but anxiety for what the future holds, especially for my own family (including my mother) as this has brought it very close to home. I also feel very tired from the ongoing strain, disturbed sleep from the stress and the monotony of being inside as well as the feeling that this has been going on forever... yet the knowledge that it has only been a few weeks and is likely to continue in a similar way for the rest of this month at least.
