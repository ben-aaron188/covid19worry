I feel stressed because of self isolation and fear because if I do there’s the possibility of catching it. I feel anxiety for family members who have to work and may carry it and possibly bring it home and my household get it. Also annoyed as the government are not taking enough action to stop people going out for fun while the rest of us suffer at home in self isolation. I don’t like that we are kept in the dark about the government and what their next steps are because I get angry thinking about them not putting lockdown in action
