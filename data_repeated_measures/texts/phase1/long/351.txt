I am very worried about the virus and that myself or a loved one might catch it. I am practicing isolation as much as possible and am not leaving the house in fear that I might catch it or pass it on. I am only leaving for the shortest period of time possible to get anything I absolutely need.
However I am glad that the planet is getting a break from pollution with less cars and planes, that communities have pulled together to look after each other and show support and that people are thinking of ways to be less wasteful and greedy.
People are thinking of new ways to use food so it doesn't get wasted and more people are thinking about the things they really need rather than things they want.
