Sad. I feel so sad about the loss of life right around the world. I'm sad about the folk who flout the rules and put others lives at risk - are they selfish, ignorant or what? I'm sad that the people of the US have such a t**t as a president and will see a big death toll.  But mostly, I'm sad for the over-worked, stressed NHS workers who work so selflessly and who are so under-resourced. Yesterday it was anger at all these things - especially the idiots who won't do as they're told. But today it's sadness.
