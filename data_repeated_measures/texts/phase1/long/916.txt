I feel lots of worry about loved ones, what will happen if they get the illness. Also feeling anxious about what is going to happen, how long this will last for and long term effect it might have. Anxiety is mostly driven by unknown things, living like this is doable but harder with not knowing all of these things, Relieved that me and husband have secure jobs, mine being In key worker sector (education). We are feeling proud of key workers in NHS and supermarkets etc who are supporting at possible expense of their own health.
