Anxious about when it will end, it has the potential to go on for months, which will not be good for my mental and physical health. Worried about friends and family, but have to face the challenges and be there to support them via technology.  I am working at a supermarket so am very aware of everything going on and the importance of social distancing. Annoyed at those who are ignoring the new laws. Think more lockdown measures should come into place before we peak, we are doing less than other country’s world wide, our airports aren’t even suggesting isolation to those returning from abroad.
