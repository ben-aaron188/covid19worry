I feel like what's being asked of us is very simple and we should abide by it so it's over quicker, but also resentful due to having to stay home. It's extremely boring and can be quite bad for people with mental health issues like myself, so I'm struggling a lot, especially not knowing when I'll be able to see people next (i.e. my boyfriend, friends, etc). I am however thankful that it hasn't affected me in any way other than being furloughed, and no family members or friends are suffering with or have died from coronavirus.
