I miss my boyfriend (who we recently was kicking things off so suddenly changing to virtual interaction only was a bit strange) I'm disgusted at how the public aren't following the rules, and anxious and in fear due to the spread because of those people. I'm scared for my own family and my own health, not just for the sake of COVID but if something else were to strike one of us or myself, that appropriate help would not be available. On top of this, I still have the workload and responsibilities of a young student who recently got a car and flat, my MOT and tax (despite being new to me) is due during lockdown, which brings me to one of my final points and feelings, general confusion towards what the government is advising - there has been varying contradictions from the government on what we should and should not do. And I don't like such leniency in some cases (such as my non-essential worker father still being loopholed into doing work) and strictness/being difficult in others such as my MOT and tax situation.
