I am worried about my family as they come under the vulnerable category. The government needs to do more and probably needs to initiate lockdown as people are still going outside for non essential reasons. This is the only way we can reduce the number of new cases and deaths each day.

Lots of anxiety over the fact that this has spread all over the world and the death rate and new cases are increasing day by day.
 
I'm scared that the economy will take a bit and worried about my job as well as my husband , how will we be able to manage if we are not able to go to work and earn money, being furloghed means we only obtain 80% of salary which eventually will not be enough to sustain our family
