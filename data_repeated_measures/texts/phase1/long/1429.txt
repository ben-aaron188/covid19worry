I'm glad that Boris Johnson might cork it, and that the majority of us are combatting this in our own special way, as well as via the means we were told to do. Not a fan of self isolating but it's for a good cause so, yknow.

America isn't holding up so well, I blame conservatism and ignorance. We'll get through this, but I hope afterwards we understand how important universal healthcare is, and socialism in general. It's funny how our society very quickly turned rather left-leaning to combat this, almost like this is the world should behave in general. Now we see a bunch of economics demand blood sacrifices to oil the gears of capitalism. I can't believe it - we have to kill people to make sure our economy stays afloat? Not right. Must change.
