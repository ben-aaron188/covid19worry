I feel anxious due to the fact that I know people who have weak immune systems. I myself would most likely be fine if I caught the virus, but I'm worried about people I know surviving. I'll be honest I've summed up my thoughts as much as I really can without just stretching what I've already written so I'm writing this to meet the character limit. I feel that five hundred characters is far too much unless you are expecting people to do exactly what I am doing. I just have nothing else to say but still need to get to the limit.
