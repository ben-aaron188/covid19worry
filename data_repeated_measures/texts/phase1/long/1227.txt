I feel very anxious every time I leave the house as a key worker in the telecommunications industry. I feel that the government should clearly state a key worker in this industry to stop companies from exploiting key worker status to make money over people's safety. For example stopping any new customers unless they fall in to the vulnerable categories and they do not have a working service. Everything else should be stopped. I would love to be allowed to work from home. I only leave the house to go to work.
