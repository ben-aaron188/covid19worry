I feel unsure about the situation we are in but I'm sure we can win the battle. of this terrible desease if we follow government guidelines and stay at home like we have been asked. Otherwise this desease could end up being slot worse than what it should be. Just stay at home let's keep one another alive in this dark pandemic time. We can beat this we will beat it stay at home people you need to do this for the welfare of everyone. Do what we are being told I don't want to die as much as the next person. Don't be selfish thinking you are immune from this if it gets you you will know about itban it want be just you it's effecting your family will suffer this too
