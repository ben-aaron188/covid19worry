I have become somewhat numb and generally have gotten used to the sad state of the Corona situation and the toll it is having on the country (and the world), however I still feel an underlying sense of anxiety. I feel somewhat restless due to the uncertainty of the future and what lies ahead and how long this crisis will last. I have a feeling of longing to see my loved ones that I have not been able to see during the crisis. I feel slightly upset and angry at people still ignoring the government and scientific advice to stay inside.
