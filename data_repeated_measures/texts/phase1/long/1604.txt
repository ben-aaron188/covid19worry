First I guess I feel a sense of almost pride that we are living though such a pivotal time. I feel annoyed at the selfishness and stupidity of some people not observing the quarantine. I do have a cautious optimism as the great majority of people are surviving the disease but all the while it is very unsettling. As a scientist I know how this will all play out but at the same time it is deeply frustrating being compelled to confine myself to home. I had heard that they are recruiting able bodied scientists to work on coronavirus test centres but my wife would never agree to that and also my boss probably wouldn't be super thrilled.
