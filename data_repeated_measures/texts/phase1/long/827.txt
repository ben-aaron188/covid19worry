Worried for the safety my family, I’m desperate to keep them safe. I’m Disappointed at the number of people who aren’t staying at home and ignoring the government’s instructions to stay home. Extremely proud of the NHS and Boris Johnson and the supreme effort that they have put to help us all. Also I’m very bored at home and I am struggling mentally to cope with stress of the situation we find ourselves in. I just hope and prey that together by following instructions we can all get through this together and when we get through this just maybe the world will be a more kind place.
