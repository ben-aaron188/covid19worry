I feel hopeful. There is still a long way to go but I am less anxious than I was. I am also feeling sombre and sad for all those that have died. I also feel a sense of duty in following the government rules and to keep going through this challenging time. I also feel grateful to all those on the front line, nhs staff, carers, supermarket workers, delivery drivers etc. I also feel glad I am able to work from home and stay safe. I feel like this is a life changing time of my life. I don't think we will ever face such a tough situation in my lifetime and feel like it will define us.
