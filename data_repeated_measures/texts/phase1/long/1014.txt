For myself, personally, I don't have any very strong feelings. I am not employed due to health issues, and spend a lot of time at home under normal circumstances anyway, so the effect of the lockdown measures on me is less than for most people. Of course, I do still feel isolated and lonely, but my day-to-day routine hasn't changed much.
I am somewhat anxious about the longer-term outlook, for myself in terms of how long the lockdown situation might last and what effect it will have as time goes on. I am also worried (but in a more detached way, of course) about the wider situation in the country and the world overall - things will get drastically worse in some places before normality returns. And I am angry at many governments for mishandling the situation in various ways, for opportunistically using the crisis to implement authoritarian measures (e.g. Hungary), and for prioritising the 'need' to prop up the existing, already dysfunctional capitalist system rather than consider deeper long-term changes to economic and societal systems.
