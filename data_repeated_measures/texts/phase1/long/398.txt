We live rurally so contamination isn't as big an issue as others. However, I am anxious when visiting the local town for shopping etc. Due to the amount of people still walking around. Social isolation is a necessity to keep fighting COVID-19. Our financial situation is also a source of anxiety. I don't work and my wife is severely disabled so all of our income comes from benefits. We worry that out situation will change and our current landlord will evict us.
The other issue I have is with the apparent non-discriminatory approach the virus has. It affects everyone, old, young, fit, unfit, rich, poor and, with the current attitude towards social isolation, it shows no signs of letting up.
