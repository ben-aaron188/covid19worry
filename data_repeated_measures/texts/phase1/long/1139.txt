Terrified for my family and friends. Worried about the whole financial situation and how we will cope. Fearful for the future in general! Worries about how everyone will recover from the whole corona efforts as its so bloody scary. It has caused me so much anxiety and  worry  and fear and general panic. I hate thinking about corona and i am so fed up of seeing it all over the news, facebook, and all social media. It is complete scaremongering.  People need to stay home and they are utterly stupid when they dont.
