I feel annoyed no one seems to be taking lock down seriously but I am grateful I am healthy. I am sad I cannot see my other half but I know this won’t be forever. I fully support the governments decision to do a lockdown just wish more people would adhere to it as it really isn’t a hard task. I am very bored and feel very lonely although I am with my family as I’m working from home and no longer seeing the people I work with unless we have a Microsoft Teams meeting! I wish everyone who has the virus a very speedy recovery and would not wish the illness on anyone. I hope the Prime Minster makes a full recovery and hope his fiancé / baby are safe too!
