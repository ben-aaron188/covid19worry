I have had generalised and social anxiety for most of my life (currently treated with daily medication). I have also worked from home for the last 15 years, so am coping surprisingly well with the current lockdown situation, especially compared to a lot of the people I am seeing and reading online. My daily life is not hugely different to the way it usually is. However, my partner is a keyworker, going out and facing the general public on an almost-daily basis. I am incredibly concerned about his health risk, and about the possibility of both of us contracting the virus. He is a smoker, and I had TB in my teens, so we are both at risk.
