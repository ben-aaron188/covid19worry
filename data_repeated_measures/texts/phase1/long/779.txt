I feel like the situation is all very uncertain, I’m really worried about my grandad who is staying at home for 12 weeks! I’m not sure how secure my job will be when this all goes back to normal, I am furloughed at the moment but there is no telling as to how long it will be until the shops reopen again.

I’m annoyed at people who aren’t taking this seriously and I’m concerned the government will loosen the lockdown too early. I’m not too bothered about my own general life being affected, I can cope without going out for food and to the pub, that can all wait!
