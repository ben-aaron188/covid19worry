very anxious and worried for my family and friends and myself. also worried about my job and also money in general over the next few months.
i am also worried about the nhs and the strain they are under at the moment and also worried about the number of people dying every day in this country and all over the world and that the cases are going up every day ,and show no signs of slowing down at the moment.
i am worried that this could go on for months or even years, and also being in isolation will affect a lot of people mentally, and a lot of people who suffer from depression and anxiety, will find being confined to the house hard to cope with.
