Feel that the threat is still coming. Feel very lonely because I live alone. Feeling I’ve eaten too much chocolate because I’m just a bit fed up and all Easter eggs on offer at the moment!
I’m more concerned for the older people I know such as my parents and someone I’m keeping an eye on in assisted-living. 
Do you feel I need to keep reminding myself how lucky I am. I live in a nice area with easy access to open spaces and I have supermarkets in walking distance. Most of the world doesn’t have this luxury.
