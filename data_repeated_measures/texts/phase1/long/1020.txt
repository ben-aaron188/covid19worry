Currently, in terms of the Corona situation at this very moment, I feel very disconnected from the situation. I feel that this is because the Coronavirus has not personally affected me yet and I live in an area where I haven't seen the effects of the virus on individuals and also the community. Also, I feel angry. I think this is because of, in my opinion, the government's slow response to the situation. I also feel sad. This happens when I read and hear about the deaths on the news and social media and think about families whose lives have been affected by the Coronavirus.
