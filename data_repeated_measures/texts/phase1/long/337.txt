I am really angry with the incomepetance of our government and their lack of using the time they had to prepare.
I am also worried out family members who have the virus. They live in seperate households and are not old but one is immunesupressed and I do worry. I am also scared for my elderly parents who are both cancer survivors. I am also tired of being scared every time I go out - which is hardly ever, as I am asthmatic and have had pnuemonia three times so am vulnerable to the virus. It is also uncomfortable on my hands as I have sensitive skin and strong soap aggravates them.
