It still feels unbelievable that this is happening. I can see it from the news and social media that people are dying, nurses and doctors pushed to their limits, emergency services trying to do their best..
I am worried about my family and our livelihood. I do believe the government is trying its best, although did not expect it to be honest. 
My heart goes out to the people who can't attend their loved ones funeral, doesn't have enough money to pay rent/bills/put food on the table or doesn't have anything at all.
