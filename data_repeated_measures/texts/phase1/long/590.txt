I’m not worried for me, as I’m a 32 year old “healthy” male. I worry about my wife who has asthma and my elderly mother who has underlying health problems. I don’t worry for myself I worry for others if they were to get it would have complications. That is my only concern. I know others are worried about their financial situation but fortunately mine isn’t going to suffer due to the virus. Hearing the death toll everyday makes you anxious and hearing the news around the world. I try to look at the news once a day just so I know the essential and then tune it out so it’s not overwhelming.
