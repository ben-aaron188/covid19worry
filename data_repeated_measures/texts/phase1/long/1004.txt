I am feeling quite relaxed because I have a lot of time for myself and I spent a lot of today doing things I wanted to be doing. However, today I haven't been very active/productive so I also feel quite tired and lazy. At the moment I am not stressing too much about the the situation because I feel quite isolated/removed from the outside world. I feel quite safe from coming into contact with the virus as all members of my household are at home most of the time and take precautions when going out.
