I feel mainly anxious and unsettled.  I am checking the news more often than is good for me, but can't help it.  I am very emotional and find myself teary when I see videos of nice things people are doing for others in the community.  Clapping for the NHS on Thursday night made me cry.  I am living alone and feel isolated but grateful for good relationships with my family, boyfriend and friends which are keeping me going.  I feel scared when I go out because other people aren't careful enough about keeping their distance.  I am therefore not going out much.  I might stop going out for a walk every day and just go every other day.  Obviously this would not be ideal for my mental health
