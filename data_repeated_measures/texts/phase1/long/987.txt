I find I'm very anxious about many things. Worried about my family and missing them very much. Worried about university and my final postgraduate MA classification because I have no access to the equipment, teaching and facilities required. I'm very anxious about the impact this (and the rest of the crisis) will have on my plans for further study (PhD). Also very concerned about income/finances and the very real prospect of being unable to pay rent/bills and student fees. I also feel that more needs to be done to support students and those just starting out as self-employed. Too many honest working people are falling through the support net and being left with nothing.
