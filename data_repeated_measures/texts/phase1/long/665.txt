I feel quite scared at the moment because a lot of my family are key workers so I worry for their safety. I feel anxious as to when it will be over because it is just awful to see people dying. I hate the fact that underlying illnesses keep getting pointed out as if it makes it any better, everyone has their time to go and theirs was still cut short. I hate the government's response to the pandemic, it was too lax at the beginning and showed how little they cared for the UK population. I know they will continue to deny their policy of herd immunity and will probably get away with it which honestly boils my blood. However, I do feel so grateful for every key worker that are putting their lives at risk for the rest of the population and I am looking forward to getting my life back.
