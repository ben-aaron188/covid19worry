I feel anxious about what’s going to happen.will I keep my job and afford my bills or will a loved one get it and die. I also feel like I’m going mad because I have ore existing health conditions I feel like every sneeze or cough and I’ve got it and it’s game over. I live alone so have nobody to help combat my anxiety or entertain me and take my mind of things. I feel angry at times because some people are not listening to the governent and I don’t understand why.i also feel sadness that some friends have lost loved ones to this
