I feel a little worried but understand it is only a temporary situation that everybody in the world is in at this point in time and put my thoughts to a more positive outcome in the future.   I try not to observe the news too much and look for a balanced view of what is happening in the world I try to be productive in any way I can to take my mind off the issue, ie hobbies, walking, gardening, tidying, cooking. I think that this sort of thing has happened before to different degrees and that eventually things have and will get back to normal. This does not mean that I havent been worried, I have been and my concern level changes day to day
