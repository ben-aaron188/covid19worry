Calm about the situation although as a key work, i have anxiety about catching the virus. We have a holiday booked so anxious on what will happen with that and that all friends and family stay safe and well. 
We are staying up to date everyday with the news reports and are hoping that as a nation and globally we can fight through it. 
There is anger towards the potential news that this started either bu the government or an accidental lab leak in china. Causing issues all over the world with not only a physical impact on health but financially for all services and sectors.
