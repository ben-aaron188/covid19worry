I feel very anxious with everything that is going on at the moment as I am terrified a loved one will catch this, especially as I have relatives who are vulnerable. It also upsets me to think of people who are alone during this time and people who are in hospital dying without loved ones. It angers me that people will not follow the simple rules of staying at home as they are putting others at risk and they do not seem to care. Having a young daughter it terrifies me that she could catch this, even if it is something she could fight it would hurt to see her in pain like that. Thinking of other people who are alone, vulnerable, etc it irritates me more to see people not following the rules.
