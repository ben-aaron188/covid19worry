I feel very fortunate that I can work from home, have job security, and have family to support me during this difficult time. The situation has made me realize how fortunate I am. I have picked up playing base guitar again shortly after the lockdown started, which has given me tremendous pleasure. 

I don't have any difficulty in the daily lives in the lockdown. If anything, I will probably be able to save a bit as I don't go out and spend money. The only thing that gives me anxiety is my parents' health. They are in a foreign country facing a serious outbreak, and I feel that the measures taken by the government are not restrictive enough.
