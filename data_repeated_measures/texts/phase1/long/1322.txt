I feel many people are not taking this seriously and it doesn't help that our government seems so unorganised, as it makes me feel they aren't taking it seriously either. There are still people going out for the sake of it and there simply isn’t enough being done to make sure people stay home. There are still people panic buying and they do it even online meaning people who actually need medicine at this moment can’t get it because there’s people buying it just in case they need it. It makes me angry that people are so selfish and ignorant and I’m scared because it means my parents have to go out for shopping and my father is at high risk and soon we will be in a predicament like Italy.
