I am scared for the economy and the people within society. The fact that it has come to lockdown throughout the country really emphasises how serious this virus is for everyone and how dangerous it really is. I am terrified that this could affect someone I know. I am also apprehensive about how long that this will last for. The fact that even our Prime Minister is in intensive care with it now really shows how dangerous this virus is and reiterates to us all that we are not taking this as seriously as we should be.
