I feel relaxed at the present moment as I don't have to wake up early and go to work. But I do feel a little bit fearful of catching the coronavirus even though I am taking all the necessary changes. It is a bit sad that the weather is nice and sunny outside and we are all stuck inside, but it's not forever, it's only a couple of months to get through.
We all need to take this serious and follow what our government is asking us to do.
I am hopeful that we will come out of this stronger as long as we all stick together and we all take precautions.
