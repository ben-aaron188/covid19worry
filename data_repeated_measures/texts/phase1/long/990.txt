I mostly feel annoyed as people are still going out and doing unnecessary trips out of their house, I work in a pet shop and there are so many people coming to the shop just to have a look around so I have to turn them away it’s stupid they should be inside it annoys me a lot as I’m then having to come into contact with them risking my safety just to tell them to stay at home, also there are more people doing exercise outside than ever which really annoys me too as it in not essential. I think people aren’t taking it seriously which puts me at risk as I have to come in to work to provide food and treatments for the animals, which really annoys me and puts fear into me as I could pass the disease to my family
