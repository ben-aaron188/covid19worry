I am Worried more for the people who are suffering and dying as a result of the virus. I miss normal day to day life as I should be studying at university right now, however have had to leave London and come home to study online. I’m also worried for my dads business as he is self employed and the corona virus is majorly effecting his income therefore effecting our home life. It’s hard following the rules of isolation as I have not seen friends and some family in months but I know it has to be done if we want the situation to improve. However I am hopeful that everyone will get through this and I believe the world will be better once we have overcome this
