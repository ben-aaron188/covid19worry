I am stressed about a whole range of things, including my ageing parents health and my job prospects as I am being made redundant at the end of June. Additionally my part time evening job has ceased due to the Corona virus putting additional strain on my Finances.

I am also very worried about contracting the virus personally - but as I am a single person I am struggling with the isolation of working and living at home alone.

I have been suffering with depression and this has not come at a good time for me adding additional stresses and barriers to my life
