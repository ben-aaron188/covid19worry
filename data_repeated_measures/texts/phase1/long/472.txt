At this moment I haven't been giving it much thought so I'd say I feel fine. I have been self-isolating along with my partner so we keep each other company. I am fortunate to not be directly affected in a manner that would be detrimental to my life and the lives of my loved ones. I feel that the UK (myself and my family included) is beginning to adjust to the new lifestyle circumstances. However, I wish other measures were implemented (e.g. ease of testing, material support for frontline workers etc.).
