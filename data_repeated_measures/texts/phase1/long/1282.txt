We are fortunate to be able to stay home at the moment and to have had food deliveries. This means the only time we leave the house is for medicine or to exercise. Therefore, we feel content for the time being. However, knowing what the situation is like is making me feel anxious about those I know and love. My parents are still having to go to work and work with vulnerable adults. Also, hearing the stories on the news makes me feel sad. Most of all, there is pride in how our NHS workers are coping with the hand they've been dealt and the stories of how they are saving lives makes me feel hopeful.
