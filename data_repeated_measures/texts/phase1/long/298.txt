My feelings are up and down.  I feel sad at times, fearful for myself and my family, loss of my previous life.  Sometimes I feel happiness at the activities I'm doing with my family, and stress about getting my job done, keeping the house clean and tidy and my child educated.  I feel under pressure from social media to be achieving things during this time.  I would like to be getting healthier but at the same time am tired, sleeping poorly, feeling unmotivated and wanting to eat and drink alcohol.
