Anxiety about what the future holds for society and the economy. Sadness for all the lives lost and fear of how many more there will be.

I feel stressed, worried, lonely and isolated. I also feel utter disgust at those flouting lockdown and purring lives at risk, as well as compromising the NHS and the work they do to keep us safe

I a concerned about the government not doing enough to force social distancing measures and that by not acting, or whether they have indeed already left it too late, that our death figures will continue to rise. I am thankful that the UK government has put financial measures in place to support people and jobs, however.
