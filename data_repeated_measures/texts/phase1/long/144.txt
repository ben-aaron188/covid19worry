I feel bored. I feel trapped at home.
I feel upset for my gap year daughter who had to be repatriated from Costa Rica and cannot see how she will get back to finish her volunteering there and in Fiji.
I feel confused. I do not understand the context of this virus. They say there are so many <insert number> infections, deaths etc. but they never tell us how that compares to an average year with average number of flu infections.
I feel worried about the restrictions that may remain in place for a significant time.
I feel unable to plan.
I feel as if I need a holiday!!
