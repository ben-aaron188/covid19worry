Finishing work at my dining table. Lovely to hear my kids playing on the trampoline outside and to chat with husband. Enjoying saving cash in things like gym membership so we can build up our emergency fund. Checking the news occasionally but not all the time so no one is getting anxious about the current situation. Enjoying the sunny weather today and having extra time to enjoy it at home now I’m not commuting. Planning to pot up my tomato plants at 5pm when I finish work at my laptop. My garden has never been so weed-free so I’m happy about that
