I am feeling sad about the social distancing. A relative is ill and at this time, it is obviously not possible to be with her. It is so worrying.
In the past, I have been fortunate enough to work abroad quite a bit, often in less developed countries. I have made a lot of friends around the world and I am worried about how the corona virus will impact them, especially those who are in countries withour a good healthcare system and those who will not get support whilst they are not working. I am also sad as I do not know when and if we will see each other again. I am sad for all who are suffering with coronavirus and for those who have lost people to the virus.
