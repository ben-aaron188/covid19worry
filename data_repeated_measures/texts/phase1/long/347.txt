i am very concerned for the future. An end to the pandemic could be some way off and I think a lot more people could die. What happens when it is all over worries me as well. The economy will take a long time to recover and we could be in for a long recession.I am trying to take it one day at a time.Working from home and trying keep busy to take my mind of worries. I am fairly angry with the way the Government has dealt with this, Some of the spread of the virus could of been reduced if action had been taken earlier.
