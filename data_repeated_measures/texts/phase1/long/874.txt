Being locked inside is both helpful in that I feel somewhat shielded from everything that's going on, but it's also producing great feelings of stress and boredom. I'm also a little anxious because nobody knows how long this is going to go on and the thought of this being the new 'normal' for a while is frustrating.
In terms of being worried, I guess because I don't know anyone that's been directly affected by it, it doesn't really feel like it's going to affect me. At the same time I realise this rather naive.
I guess if I were to describe it all in one word it would be confused.
