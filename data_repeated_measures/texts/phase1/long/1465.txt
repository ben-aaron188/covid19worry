I feel anxious about my income, I had to self isolate because I was presenting symptoms and I got laid off for that and didn't even get paid sick pay. Now, I don't know what to do, the government is not helping me at all. Also, I am more anxious because I am the one that supports my mom and grandmother who are in another country. I don't know what will kill me first, corona or stress. I had many plans, and this thing is postponing all of them. I know I can overcome this, but the stage I'm at the moment is too dark. I want this to finish now.
