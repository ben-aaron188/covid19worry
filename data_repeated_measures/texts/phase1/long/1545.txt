A lot of anxiety for the health of my friends and family, namely those who fall into the vulnerable brackets or have underlying health conditions. Fear, sadness and also the utmost respect for the health workers on our frontlines. Under paid and under appreciated for so long. Anger at the current government doing the bare minimum and being applauded for ‘trying their best’ - that isn’t good enough when their inaction is killing people and their vague rules easily misinterpreted. Is the message stay home at all costs, or is it ‘go for one run a day’? It just doesn’t add up. Furious at people who continue to flaunt the rules. But mostly just anxious, tired and sad and ready for this to be over so my friend can get the chemo she needs hopefully before it’s too late (at the moment it is all on hold for at least 3 months because she is deemed too high risk).
