Feeling unsure what the situation is and how it will last. The society is not working together makes me feel sad and unsafe. The government should order peopke to a complete lockdown pkus a more educatuon on whats other conutries are doing right to fight the situation. We will get through this and this is what people need to know. I have experienced SARS when I was younger, Hong Kong people can get through this. British should just get it together and learn from the past experience. Nothing wrong with taking the safest precaution to prevent the the worst thing happen to the country.
