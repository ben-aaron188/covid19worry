Due to losing job, I have been isolating for almost 3 weeks now, and I am young, fit and healthy. I understand the potential consequences and concerns but other than financially I don't feel at much risk. I am more worried for my own mental health if this continues for months on end but right now I feel okay. Enjoying the time at home and being creative and productive in other things than work. Miss the pub and meeting friends, but it is what it is. Am more concerned for my family members but even then not severely. Hoping everything will go well for everyone.
