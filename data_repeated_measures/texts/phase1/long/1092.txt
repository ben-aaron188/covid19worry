I think the best words to describe how I feel are busy and overwhelmed.  I am busier then usual because I now have 5 homeschool children at home, whereas I am used to them being at school during the day.  I am feeling overwhelmed because suddenly far more people want to interact, video chat, call, text, e-mail, etc.  I am an introvert and I find the amount of social check-ins that are suddenly expected to be very overwhelming, time-comsuming and exhausting!  I feel like between 5 busy children at home and outside people constantly demanding my attention via video call, mobile phone, text, etc, that I am overwhelmed with expectations.  
I don't feel fear, worried or anxious because I don't have time to feel those things.  I don't have time to dwell on the situation we are in.
