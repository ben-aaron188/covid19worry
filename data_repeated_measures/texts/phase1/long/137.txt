I thought I would be struggling a lot more than I am so far. I am working from home and not leaving the house and have been doing this for about 3 weeks. I thought I would have been struggling by now and getting upset about it a lot but I'm okay, I've had a couple of wobbles but that's it. I don't think it's really sunk in properly/I haven't processed the situation I'm in personally with being stuck at home as I find it very surprising that I'm coping at the moment. I feel grateful to still have a routine and be working Monday-Friday as I think this is what's getting me by, I feel like the time is passing very quickly.
