Anxious about not knowing how long the situation will go on for. The restrictions on movement worry me more than the virus itself. My daughter is only 3 and I worry about how she will be affected as time goes on. Of course, I do also worry about loved ones catching the virus and getting sick. I feel lonely as I don't live with anyone except my daughter. It feels relentless, like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I'm self-employed and I worry about how it will affect my job, as I'm a single parent.
