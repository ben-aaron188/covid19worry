Initially I didn’t realise how serious this was. I thought it was like the flu and didn’t understand why everyone was talking about it so much. I now realise it is serious and it makes me very anxious. I am worried for my children. I am worried for my parents, especially because my mother is having to isolate for 12 weeks. I am missing her. I don’t like the streets being quiet and shops having queues. It is necessary and that’s fine. But it’s all so different and it’s not knowing when it will end that scares me. I just want people to listen to advice and it’ll all be over quicker.
