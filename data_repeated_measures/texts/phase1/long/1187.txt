I am worried about how the virus is progressing. The recent news about the PM is worrying as he will have been following the guidelines and had the best medical care. Myself and my children have asthma so I worry about how we would manage if we got the virus. My husband still has to go to work so I worry about him bringing the virus into the house. I am happy to be spending time at home with my family but a bit frustrated at not being able to go outside. I am missing my wider family. We are having regular video call conversations but it isn't the same as a hug from your mum.
