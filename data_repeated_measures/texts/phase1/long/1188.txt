I feel very angry and annoyed with people that are not listening to the rules and not staying home, the amount of people that have been seen in big groups and with friends etc in public places is ridiculous. This is leading me to feel very worried about what is going to happen to the economy, the likes of travel and businesses, what this is going to do to them. Most of all I am the most worried about my loved ones, keeping them safe, worried about my elderly grandmother that lives alone and how this is going to affect her mental health.
