I'm anxious as I have family members that would be affected greatly if they were to contract the virus. I'm also struggling to find the supplies for food and pet supplies in general, as deliveries are being delayed and I can't leave the house due to symptoms, and I am required to self-isolate for at least 14 days, but if my symptoms continue I will be stuck in the house for longer. I think the government should've acted sooner as a prevention method instead of reacting to the virus's spread, as preemptive measures would've been more effective.
