I am not too worried about the situation as I believe I am a fit and healthy human being. I am more worried about family members becoming ill with the disease and I am also very sad that I cannot see them at this time. Thankfully with technology these days I can see them everyday through a screen and chat to both friends and family whenever I want to. Its just annoying that I cannot leave the house apart from to get essentials, I live in a flat and with the nice weather we are having its becoming quite a struggle.
