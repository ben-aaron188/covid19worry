At the moment I feel really quite relaxed as the situation here locally is very peaceful and quiet. The sunny weather is probably contributing to this. We are lucky that our house and garden is big enough to keep us occupied, so in a way this feels like a holiday right now. We have quite a few major projects lined up doing things we have been meaning to do for ages. Now we are basically forced into doing them to use the time gainfully. We will see how we feel next week if the lockdown were to be tightened up due to some irresponsible individuals.  I am sad that I had to cancel my plans to go abroad to visit elderly relatives, but 'it is as it is'.
