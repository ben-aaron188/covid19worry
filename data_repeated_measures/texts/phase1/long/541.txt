I’m feeling much more anxious this week about the virus. 
I’m afraid of catching the virus and not being able to work and then being able to pay bills. 
I’m afraid of elderly family catching it and not being able to fight it off. I’m concerned about the people I look after in supported living because of the amount of staff they’re having in their homes. I’m disgusted with people not abiding by the lockdown and going out to public places and socialising. They’re putting us all risk and making us all more vulnerable.
