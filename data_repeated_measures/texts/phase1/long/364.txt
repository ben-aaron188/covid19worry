Slightly worried as I'm in a high risk category but am doing everything I can to keep safe and occupied mentally and physically while I remain inside most of the time. I feel lucky to have a garden to relax and exercise in. Concerned about older relatives around the world and how other places such as the US are tackling the situation. As I'm self-employed there's a constant sense of anxiety that I haven't been able to work for several weeks and government help won't be coming as quickly as would be useful.
