I feel trapped.  I haven't been out of the house since Friday afternoon.  I am working from home.  I want to go out for a walk but get anxious about the thought of it.  So I stay in doors. The days are just rolling into one.  I am happy on the whole but the want and need to go out is overwhelming sometimes.  I feel like every day is wasted.  The news is draining.  I try not watch.  Just want to do the time and get it all over with so I am just staying home and getting on with is.  Like a prisoner doing their time.
