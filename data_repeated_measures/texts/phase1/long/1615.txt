I am slightly worried about the situation and the effect it is going to have for the future. I have worries about what would happen if members of my family were infected and needed hospital treatment, as the situation there seems very bad. I am also concerned about how this is going to affect my university studies and the uncertainty around my assessments is causing me anxiety. But I feel fairly relaxed about the lockdown measures that are in place and don’t find them too difficult to manage or too restricting. However, if the situation worsens and further limitations need to be put into place (e.g no exercise outside of the home) I would find this very difficult and restricting. This worries me as I don’t think people are following the guidelines appropriately.
