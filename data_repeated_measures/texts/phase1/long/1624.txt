Very angry that it has taken a lot of lives, more so as people are not taking the social distancing serious which is probably leading to more deaths...... sad that I’m away from my family but my mum is a nurse so it is necessary as she is working with vulnerable people. It’s taking its toll however I’m thankful that I’m not infected with the disease.

Moving forward it will be nice when this is all over and normal life can resume. I have some anxiety about some facts in the news stating this might go in till October rather than June but I’m trying to stay positive
