I a fairly relaxed. At the end of the day, if you are able to follow the guidelines and reduce human contact to as low as possible, then you ought to be ok. I have to go out to shot but try to get out early when it is quite and with the new procedures supermarkets are enforcing, I feel fine. In addition, if you are meant to catch the virus, then you probably will. I had a cardiac arrest lasting 72 minutes last year ad survived without issue, so it kind of makes me more relaxed. 500 characters for 50P that's a canny rate of return!
