Currently I am more frustrated than worried as my loved ones and I are taking all necessary precautions to avoid the virus. However many people aren't following the guidelines imposed by the government and I am aware that these people are going to cause the lockdown to go on for longer, interfering with other's lives due to their own selfishness. In addition, I am saddened when I think about what I am missing out on; my first year at university and a summer in Sri Lanka. I also keep thinking about how happy I was this time last year and how I took it for granted.
