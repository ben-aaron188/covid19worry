I am nervous about the impact of the virus on my family and friends, but I'm also highly frustrated by the restrictions put in place. It has made my job very challenging through working at home, and has added a greater number of obstacles. I fully support the restrictions, but I fear it will damage the relationship my baby daughter has with family members and hinder her development. In terms of my own risk of infection, and any subsequent complications, I am fairly secure in my ability to fight it off, even if I'm unlucky enough to contract it. I have no underlying health issues and generally respond well to illness. My main concerns centre around my parents and their ability to survive should they contract it.
