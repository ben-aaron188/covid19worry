I am worried in particular about the long-term. I hope that normal life can resume quicker than I expect it too but only if it is safe for everyone. I wish that everyone would follow the rules, so that we can get through this quicker rather than cause more issues in the long-term. I hope that a vaccine will come sooner than the current projections. I am not currently struggling with the lockdown but moreso just missing being able to go anywhere I want at any time. I am having trouble trying to find some type of work I can do at home in order to earn extra money.
