I feel waves of anxiety throughout the day. I am very scared of the virus and of contracting it myself. I have a phobia of hospitals and so the idea of needing to be hospitalised is very scary for me. I am also concerned for the wellbeing and health of my family, friends and co-workers. As a teacher, it is likely that I will be needed in school again soon and that makes me feel very anxious.
If I can just stay home I feel safer, but leaving the house to buy food or to go into work makes me panic. I just want this to all be over.
