I still feel worried about the Corona situation at the moment.  Although. I feel slightly relieved as the death figures have reduced for the UK as a whole but in particular they have plummeted in Scotland for 2 days in a row to 2 deaths per day.  However, I'm a little anxious as to whether this will continue and hoping that people don't relax the advice of self isolating or social distancing because of this as this would undo the good that has been done.  I still feel a little ponderous as to how this virus has started and the cause.  I also get very annoyed about people not being respectful of the 2 metre distance.  I feel pretty anxious about the economy also as I'm wondering about the long term effects this lock down will have on the country and the world.  There is so much hardship and poverty already in this country.
