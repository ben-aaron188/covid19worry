I feel extremely worried about my family, friends and myself it has caused my anxiety to massively spike. I am sad I can't go and come as I please. Completely overwhelmed by this situation and the unknown outcome of what happens and how life will be on the other side after this is over. I am fearful that I and/or my partner will lose my job. I am particularly worried for the long-term effects of our way of life. Feel quite helpless as it seems society is ready to judge or turn on each other. It is very depressing especially when you realise we are no where near the end of this horrible pandemic.
