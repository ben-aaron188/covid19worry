I'm just getting scared now as more and more people are being admitted to the hospital. I don't know what the future holds for this country or even world and it makes me very anxious. I think the situation will get worse before it gets any better.

In the beginning, it was only old people and the vulnerable that we're getting this virus and being admitted to hospital, now younger people with no medical issues are being hospitalized and even dying. I don't know why or how. People are starting to think this didn't start from someone eating a rabid bat. It seems deeper than that. I also think a lot of people's mental health will be affected, as well as financial health. What will happen when this is all over? The impact on the economy will be drastic.
