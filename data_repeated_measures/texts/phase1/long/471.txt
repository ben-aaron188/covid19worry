I am anxious because i think the plateau we are in is going to lead to a false finish. People are going to see the numbers this week and then start forgetting about social distancing. I imagine another spike in June and then maybe another in octobre. I fear that next winter is going to be the ""real"" hit, when we think we are past it and stop taking precautions. I dont expect medicine to be available for a while because vacines are hard and rushing them through will cause more damage if they end up hurting people or not having a good enough efficency to curtail covid.
