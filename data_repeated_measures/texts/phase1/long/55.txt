I am very worried for my families health as we have a number  members with poor health. Can see not end to this and feel like I am helpless to keep my family safe Also worried about the long term effect this will have on all of our daily lifes. So overwhelmed with the amount of news and information come towards us every day frighten I missed the important bit that keeps use all safe.
Very confused as what the best thing is to do not my family also. 
Feel so helpless and also amazed how poorly so many Governments have dealt with this issue.
