Currently feeling anxious about the country as a whole, and the economic effect this will have in the short to mid-term. Personally feel tired but somewhat proud of the work myself and my colleagues are doing (we work in a pharmacy). Also feel uncertain as to when things will return to some kind of normality. Feel more tired than normal but not sleeping so well. Feel saturated by the news coverage. Generally feel that people in my area are observing the advice to stay home. On a global scale am very concerned for the potentially catastrophic effect the virus could have in Africa.
