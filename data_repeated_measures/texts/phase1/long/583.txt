I feel anger at the people who are not listening to what the government are saying , not listening to the lockdown rules,  Risking not there own but everyone’s else’s lives. The government should the exercise once a day rule as people are using it as an excuse to do what they please. It angers me knowing without everyone pulling together we may never get over this and we will lose even more life’s.
The nhs are risking there life’s everyday and to see so many selfish people not listening is upsetting and disgusting.
