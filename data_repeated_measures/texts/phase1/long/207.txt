Its frightening that in this day and age we have a disease we cannot control. I am disgusted with the Chinese as this disease evolved from them and their lack of hygiene.  The Chinese government should be held responsible and should compensate us for the debt our country will be left with. I hope USA take them to task.i am fearful for members of my family, some of whom are classed as vulnerable,  I am so angry they have been put in this position and I cannot see my family in person for the forseeable future.
