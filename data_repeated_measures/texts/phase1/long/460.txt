I feel anxious about the pandemic as it is very unknown what the long term effects will be to people suffering as well as the loss of life which is happening across the World. Although I am not in a vulnerable group, I have not been out and hope that I do not get the virus. I feel sad that people have suffered and a bit angry that some people are not taking the lockdown seriously. This means that we may have to do this for a longer time. I am worried that I will not be able to find work as I am a freelancer and rely on clients wanting to use my services.
