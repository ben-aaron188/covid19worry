I'm saddened that I'm not able to travel at the moment, I had quite a few plans for April that have been scuppered. In general I'm not all too affected due to being an introverted homebody, but am shocked at the sheer level of contagiousness of the virus and in the longer term really hope it shows those in charge how important the NHS is. I really hope that people can pull together and don't drag this out longer than it needs to, although the pessimist in me isn't expecting that much.

Also, although I feel a little bad for it there's a certain amount of schadenfreude gained from knowing the Prime Minister is now ill with coronavirus after his being so weak-willed for so long when the dangers first started appearing.
