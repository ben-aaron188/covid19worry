I feel lucky to be in good health but concerned about elderly relatives and friends and family with existing health issues which means they could be at risk.
I am enjoying the break from routine and I like working from home.
I also feel more connected to my partner and family and am enjoying spending time with them.
I am a little frustrated at not being allowed to go outside but understand the reasons why and I am respecting the lock down's rules.
I am also disappointed that my holiday was cancelled but I sometimes feel guilty for feeling this way because I know a lot more people are in worse situations. 
I feel sad for those who have lost loved ones and for those that are seriously unwell in hospital.
