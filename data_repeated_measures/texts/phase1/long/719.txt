I find it very worrying as people are not taking it serious enough  .a bit of warm weather and people are acting that there’s not a scary virus going around and it scared me to think we won’t ever get this over and done with . I miss my family so much but know it’s best to stay away and stay indoors . I just hope we find a cure so people can go back to work again and live life .i have lost a few people so far and it’s so upsetting
G that I can’t say goodbye to loves ones and that they died alone
