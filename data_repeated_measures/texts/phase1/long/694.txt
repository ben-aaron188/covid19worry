Watching the tv and seeing pictures of people on ventilators in hospital etc is very worrying and people die without their family around them its so sad :-(

i'm already a germ freak so this virus is making me ten times worse as I feel everything that comes into the house is contaminated so I'm having to spray everything with anti bacterial spray

i certainly don't want to die like that and then to some health care workers who live on my street flouting the rules is a disgrace

I am also angry at some of my neighbours who don't seem to be taking this seriously and are still having visitors
