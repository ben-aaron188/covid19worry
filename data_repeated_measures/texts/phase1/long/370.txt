It is a concerning time, though I am concerned more for the health and safety of others more than my own health. I am a healthy individual and cope well with illnesses. It has had a dramatic effect on my work situation, as a emergency service worker, and my home life, with my partner now working from home.
I hope that the virus is not as potent as first thought, but we will not know this until widespread testing is complete. It is difficult to understand the true severity of the death rate currently as we cannot be clear with how many people have been infected and recovered.
