I feel fairly relaxed so far, although being locked for 3 weeks starts to take its toll and do miss social interactions. We do try and have some calls/videos with my friends as much as possible. Staying in touch with my family back in France is also important for me
I feel a bit worried for older people at risk and that the NHS is being overwhelmed.
I also hope things will get back to some sense of normality and not too many people will die as a result.
I personally feel lucky I have a job I can keep and be paid.
