I am not extreemly worried about the corrona virus situation, I know it will pass eventually if we al follow the rules and stay inside. However, it is extreemly annoyong as it means I wont be able to see my girlfriend for a while. I will also not be able too see any of my friends in person, but we all manage to talk online everyday. This situation has given me the opotunity to become healthier as i am eating better and exersicing more in my garden, which is a positive outcome for this situation. I am only slightly scared for my grandma as she is alone and vunerable, but I know she will be fine in the end.
