At the moment I am feeling very worried about the corona situation as my mum is diabetic and has other health problems and I live at home with her, I am scared I will catch the virus from visiting a busy place like a supermarket or other essential place I need to go and pass it onto my mum, this thought is giving me a lot of anxiety. I am also worried about the number of deaths in my city as the number is slowly rising and the number of infected is getting quite high too. I'm also worried that I wont be able to find a job as I have been unemployed for several months now
