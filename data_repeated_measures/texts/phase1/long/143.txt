Whilst I really am fearful and anxious about this pandemic and what the future holds, I do currently feel more relaxed as my whole family have been safe at home with me. I also already suffer with contamination OCD, severe anxiety and occasionally depression so all those feelings are particularly high on a daily basis but have strangely calmed down since the lockdown and being at home with my family. Before the lockdown my anxiety and ocd was completely out of control and I was having panic attacks each night.  I am very sad about all the poor people who have lost their lives and feel awful for all their loved ones.
