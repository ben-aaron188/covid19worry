The government is doing a good job at the moment but i do get annoyed with media when they keep asking the government about when the lockdown is going to end.And every afternoon when listening to the government coronavirus daily brief,i really get annoyed by the same questions they keep asking especially when the questios had already been addresses during the briefing.at the moment i am reaal happy that people in area are following the social distance guidelines by staying in and only going out to have a walk or shopping when required.
