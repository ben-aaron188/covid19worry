I’m feeling fairly relaxed about it all. I’m not worried about potentially getting ill, but I am very annoyed about the UK government response. They have been so ineffective in their implementation of a lockdown, they have failed the NHS by not providing adequate PPE and also failed all of us by pursuing a path which does not require testing of suspected cases. You cannot track a pandemic if you don’t test everyone.
They have lied about ventilators, claiming that a company was making them specially despite the fact that companies which already made them were not ordered from.  They claimed not to get the memo from the EU regarding bulk buying of ventilators. I really hope that once this is all over, this sham government are held to account by everyone, including the media who just seemed to nod and agree with everything coming from Downing Street.
