I hope that whatever powers the government use to combat this pandemic will not be abused to further restrict individual rights and freedoms once this virus has abated. I am also angry that China's appalling culture of wetmarkets has caused this pandemic in the first place. If it wasn't for their wildlife trade and lack of animal rights, this most likely would never have happened.

I am also deeply worried about the impact this will have the economy long-term. As ever, it will be small businesses and the average worker that suffers.

On the other hand, at least people are spending more time with their children at home, and people are realizing just how worthless sports really are.
