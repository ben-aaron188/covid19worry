I am concerned that I will be unable to get the supplies I need from the supermarket and with the current restrictions of being unable to go with someone else my anxiety is becoming a problem as I can struggle in public on my own, particularly during more difficult situations.
I am also concerned for my own health, as I have asthma so am somewhat more susceptible to more severe effects, but due to my young age people do not consider it that I might need help getting food and supplies.
I also feel like the government are not providing enough help, yet are still insisting these fairly strict restrictions.
