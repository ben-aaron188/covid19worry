very scared that I'll get it, I am already in an at risk group. The likelyhood of serious harm to myself is high with my pre-existing conditions. My social situation is like everybody else's deteriorating and will take many months to improve judging by the progression of the virus and the impact on the social and economic life in this country. all activities that i used to participate in have been closed off to me I do not work so do not get much (any) social contact. The activities I would like to be able to do are not likely to resume in any particular hurry either.
