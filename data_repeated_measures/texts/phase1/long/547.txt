There is nothing I can do about it so I am not too bothered, instead I am just getting on as best as I can. I am also young and healthy and do not need to leave the house so I am not concerned for my safety. I am not happy about the people who are ignoring the lockdown and making the situation worse for everyone else, including endangering other people's lives. I work for a healthcare provider and so I am busier than usual, so I am perhaps more tired than usual. I feel sympathy for our frontline healthcare workers having to deal with this, and without all the PPE that they need.
