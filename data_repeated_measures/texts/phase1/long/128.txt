A short 3-week lockdown is bad enough but there is the possibility that it could be extended well beyond that.  As it is, this is having a major social impact and the economic cost will surely be great: the longer the lockdown continues, the worse such effects will be.  Given the low fatality rate of Corvid-19 and the ability of most healthy people to recover from it without overwhelming symptoms, it can be argued that this lockdown is Draconian and unjustified.
Businesses and jobs will collapse.
