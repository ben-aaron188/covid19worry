I feel confused by all of the online news surrounding the situation and fearful about finances if the situation worsens.
I fear that people with or without the virus will find it difficult to get any help that they might need at this time.
I do feel thankful that I can focus on the household jobs that I don't get time to do when I am working and I have time to be creative if i feel like it. I am happy I can spend time with my partner but I do not like the feeling of being constricted to staying indoors.
