Worried about the health of my loved ones as I have a few family members who are elderly and also have under lying health issues. I am also greatly concerned about the long standing impact the corona virus will have on the economy as me and my partner are young and have a mortgage. We are also saving for our wedding next year so our plans may be impacted. I am angry at the conservative government in the UK as I feel they are morally corrupt and inept to address the issue properly as they are renowned for being inept and compulsive liers.
