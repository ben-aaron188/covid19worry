I'm finding the whole situation very anxiety-provoking and hard to deal with. I already suffer with OCD and general anxiety, and this has been a huge trigger. I feel hopeless about the future in general and like things are never going to get back to normal again. It's like being in limbo, nothing feels completely real and I've been having issues with derealisation/depersonalisation. 
I'm worried about family members and friends and how they're coping, and about side effects such as the chain of supply for food, medication etc being broken.
