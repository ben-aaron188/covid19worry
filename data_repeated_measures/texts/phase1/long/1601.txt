This situation is quite worrying as I do not know when this virus will end. I am very curious about this virus as I want to know how this will be suppressed and this actually started. Anxiety has taken over me as I have no idea when I could go back to work and earn money to provide for my family. What will happen if this virus continues? Supermarkets are calming down and tissues are available now. I feel as if I am stuck in a box and the walls are closing in. I am only allowed to do outside for essentials and this is taking a toll on my whole family.
