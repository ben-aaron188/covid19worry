I worry about how the government are handling the current situation. I feel like they decided to tackle the situation too late. It concerns me that the UK economy will really struggle to survive, as a self employed person who makes cards and invitations as my primary job, I am worried that about a lack of financial help right now as I have no savings or money in the business to draw on. My mental health is also suffering because of all the worries bubbling under the surface in my mind and Iâ€™m not sleeping well.
