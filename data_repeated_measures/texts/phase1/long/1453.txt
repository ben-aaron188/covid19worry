Very worried at the moment,, you know its not good when the PM get the virus. Worried about people not staying indoors and making the situation worse, really need to figure out on-line shopping as I don't want to go shopping outdoors anymore. 

I fear someone in my family could get the virus, I do have faith in thre government to do what is required but we need a full lockdown and only essential shopping for food. 

Sad about the PM going into intensive care, this is soo unexpected really hope he gets out of this asap.
