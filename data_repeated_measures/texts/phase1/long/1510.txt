i feel depressed over the situation. how long restrictions will last unerves me a bit. also worried about wheter my dad will contract the virus and how his body will react. Im also worried about how my mental health will be after so long without seeing friends as i have no release at home which makes me feel lonely.

im curious to see how the economy will react to it basicall coming to a standstill, and feel sorry for the people who will inevitably lose jobs due to the virus as companies will need to balance the books.
