I currently feel relaxed as I am home. I have been self isolating with my family for three weeks now. Luckily we live in s house with a garden so we have access outside and I have an allotment to go to as well. We also have a dog for us to take a turns to walk. Though I don't trust the pm and currently feel the news about him being in IC is quite possibly spin as he had been losing support in the papers. Hope I'm right in this and not coming across as cold hearted, but that is most likely due to a the lies he has told to date. We have been taking slot of care whilst self isolating.
