I don't really feel anything too strongly. My lifestyle has been somewhat unaffected by the outbreak except for food and essentials being out of stock which is only a small inconvenience. I feel uneasy due to the vast amount of information about the virus but no real way to check the accuracy or truth to the claims I read. Filling myself up with unverified information about the virus does the most to affect my mood, You have to go through a lot of baseless claims and false information about the virus before you find something with substantial evidence
