I am relaxed at the moment. I just got back from shopping and have my dinner on. I rest assured that the truth about the Corona virus (of which there are lots)will come out and those responsible will be dealt with accordingly. Hence I am getting on with my life the best I can. I intend to chill this evening and watch a film which helps to take ones mind off the whole debacle. I may also pray that the world wakes up to the nonsense that they are being bombarded with. I am even relaxed while writing these statements which is a good thing.
