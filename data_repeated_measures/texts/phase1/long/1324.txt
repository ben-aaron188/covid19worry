I'm quite relaxed at home at the moment. I moved house just before the lockdown hit, so it's been nice to have the free time to get used to a new place.

I've taken the extra time (and unreliable supermarket stock) to experiment with new recipes and expand my horizons in the kitchen.

However, I'm anxious about how long the situation will last. I'm currently not earning a salary. I can't claim sick pay since I'm self-employed and also ineligible for Universal Credit, so I am a little concerned the quarantine will continue to make the economy unpredictable and as a result, ensure I am earning nothing.
