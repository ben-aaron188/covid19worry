I am worried about my family/self getting ill as my husband is a key worker. I am bored and frustrated being stuck in with children including 2 with autism and a 9 week old baby. I am scared for the world right now as we have no idea when this will end or how it will end. I have anxiety creeping in. I can't bare the thought of losing any of my children or husband. I am scared of getting sick, I am nursing my baby and she wont drink from a bottle. I am trying to prepare my mental state for all eventualities but its hard with all the chaos at the moment.
