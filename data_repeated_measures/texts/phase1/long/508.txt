I feel stressed and anxious a lot of the time. I have had to limit the amount of time that I watch the news as it was getting me down - I now check in a couple of times a day. I have family who are at risk and this is a worry. I feel safer in doors and see things like shopping now as a bit of a frantic time, getting in and out as quickly as possible so as to reduce exposure. I fear what will happen and cannot see an end to this but hope that a few as people as possible will die. This is unprecedented times and it feels very strange to have life changed so much just something which we cannot see.
