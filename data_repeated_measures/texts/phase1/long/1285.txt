I am angry that the government has taken too long to act, and that nearly 5000 people are dead because of them. Too many people are struggling for money due to lack of work, and this is further proof that universal credit is a failed system, and does not work in the interests of the needy. I feel afraid to catch coronavirus because of my underlying health conditions, and I am also angry at the government for underfunding and gutting the NHS for over a decade. I am angry at the government at the best of times, but their handling of this situation has only furthered this.
