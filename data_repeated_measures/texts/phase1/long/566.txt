I am worried and want life to go back to normal. I feel like I won't get really sick but know that there is a chance which is scary. I am more concerned about my children than anything else. I don't want them to get sick, I am worried what will happen if they do. I don't want them to be alone in hospital. I am happy for the lockdown to continue to get on top of the virus. I am angry at people who are ignorant of the guidelines and keep going out at the risk of others. I am tired of reading about all many people dying
