I feel at peace with the situation. As I am at home self-isolated with my family (husband and children) and we and our extended families are well and safe I feel ok about our current situation. I am working full time, my children are off school and my husband has been furloughed and therefore only being paid 80% of his full salary whilst being unable to work. However, when I think about others that I see in the news, on social media or those who I know through family and friendship networks who have become sick from the virus, or who have had their personal and financial circumstances adversely affected by the virus I feel very lucky that our situation is manageable. At the end of the day our health and wellbeing is the most important thing and we are lucky that we are all together safe and well at home rather than outside exposed to the virus. I feel very fortunately also that we are able to afford a 20% reduction in my husbands salary. This makes me pretty secure and stable. Although I do hope that things return to normality sooner rather than later. That said, I am enjoying all our extra family time together, shorter work days and not having to commute through London.
