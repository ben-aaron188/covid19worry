I’m still very worried about covid-19 at this moment in time, mainly for other members of my family. My wife is 27 weeks pregnant with twins so is classed as high risk, even before the virus came. Everyone in our house is classed as vulnerable so we are all very worried. Life has completely changed and we don’t know long for, so we are also concerned about mental health. My parents have underlying health conditions, so if they caught it then there’s a good chance it could get serious. There is also a worry for the economy and potential job losses.
