I feel worried I have a 2 and a half year old son and also gave birth 2 weeks ago, no one has been able to meet our new baby, midwives and health visitors are doing assessments at the moment so we aren’t getting the same support we usually would. We are all staying inside as I am scared of contracting the virus or my children becoming ill. However my husband works in a factory which is non essential but this is still open and he is due to return to work from paternity leave any day however this is causing me a lot of anxiety as he’ll be working with 40 other men and I am worried about the risk this poses to us as a family.
