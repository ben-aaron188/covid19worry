I just want it all to be over as soon as possible. I am fed up of lockdown and really miss my girlfriend who is back in Ireland with her family. Every time I go outside for a walk round the block I feel really anxious whenever I see someone from outside my household. I am really fed up of being stuck inside. Having been furloughed I cannot even focus on my work during the week which helped occupy my mind. I am very anxious about my job security and my ability to find another job if I lose my current.
