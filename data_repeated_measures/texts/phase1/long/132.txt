I have various feelings about this.
1. I am anxious on a personal level because myself and my wife both have health conditions which make us potentially vulnerable to this virus, and so we are doing everything we can to minimize risk.
2. I am also anxious for the country, and the world, as I see health services at full stretch and struggling.  I am also concerned for all those at risk of losing their jobs and livelihoods.
3. I am sad for all those who have lost their lives, and for their families and loved ones.  I am also sad for all those who have lost their jobs and livelihoods or are suffering financial hardship.
5. I am concerned for all those living in countries where available funds and health provision are woefully insefficient to protect the population.
6. I am angry with our Conservative government for cutting back on our health service during the last 10 years, and for failing to prepare for such a pandemic.  As a consequence our NHS is stretched to the limit and the staff are under huger pressure.  I am also angry that the government have failed to provide adequate PPE or testing, placing NHS staff in danger, and exacerbating the spread of the virus.  I am also angry that the government initially had a reckless dangerous strategy to let the virus freely infect the population, which would have killed hundreds of thousands of people.  Even when they changed strategy and began to take measures to control the virus they acted too slowly, again exacerbating the situation and costing lives.
