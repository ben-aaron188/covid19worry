So as it stands I feel very overwhelmed by the situation due to me being deployed soon enough and expecting our third child I feel it's not a world I want to bring any child up in but unfortunately have to! It's really to think that at any moment a member of my family could get the coronavirus and it can effect us all! So many people have died already and it just makes me think who's next and am I going to know them! I feel scared for the elderly people that I know and others around that cannot help but suffer the most knowing that it could potentially kill them!
