This is all making me feel a bit sad at the moment and need this to be all over as soon as possible so we all can get back to normal.  I think that the government should not be treating the country all together as a whole as there are obviously differences between what steps need to be undertaken by people in large cities such as London as opposed to people living in rural Scotland.  I think there is too much ambiguity about what citizens can and can't do and the fact that some people seem to be swanning around and behaving as normal is galling to others who are following the governments rules to the letter.
