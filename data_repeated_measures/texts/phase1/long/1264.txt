Just worried about the future. There's so much uncertainty about my health, my family's health and our financial state that we just want it all to stop and go back to normal. That's the key to the situation, normality. Adapting to new ways of living (e.g. staying at home all the time and working from home without getting out) is proving to be increasingly difficult day by day. It's hard staying shut all day without getting any fresh air. I just want life to go back to the way it was where I could come and go as I please and go out and play sports/see friends/go out to eat etc.
