i am more worried as time goes on. I think it is wrecking the economy and I am worried about the future and how long we will be on lockdown and living this strange half life. I am not concerned about getting the virus as much as I think some people are. However, the fact that healthy people are catching it and dying does make me concerned about passing it on so I am following the social distancing guidelines. I am only walking once a day and trying to limit social interaction. I think the virus has killed more people in China than the official figures state and it is going to kill a lot more people.
