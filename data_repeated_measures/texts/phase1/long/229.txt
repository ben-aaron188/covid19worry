its sad what is going on in the world hopefully the enconmy will recover from this. very gratefull for all those key workers out there helping the country and putting there lives at risk they are a big credit sad how many people have had to die from this and not nice for those familys if we stick together we can get through this and eventually get things back to some sort of normaility everyone just needs to stay at home so this doesnt drag on and on and on otherwise this thing will go on and more people will dies
