I have conflicting feelings.

What's happening in the world is horrible, there's no doubt about that, it incredibly sad to see and hear of so many deaths in the world because of this awful disease and I really do hope that we find a way to contain/cure this soon and save as many lives as possible.

Looking for a silver lining, however, I'm working from home and my mental health has massively improved because of it. My day usually involves waking at 5am, driving 30 miles to work usually stressing out in traffic, and once I get to work I'm tired before I've even started, then I have to do it again in the evening, usually getting home late in the evening, not having time to cook properly because I just want a few hours on the couch to switch off before I have to go to bed and get up at 5am again.
With my current working from home situation, I'm getting twice as much sleep as I normally do (usually only get around 4 or 5 hours tops), I'm not stressed and tired from driving for over an hour, I'm able to switch off at a reason time in the early evening and actually cook healthier meals, spend more time with my partner etc.
So although the whole reason we're in this mess is awful, by being forced to stay home and work, my mental and physical health has hugely improved.
