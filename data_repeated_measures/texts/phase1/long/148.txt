I am fearful about how many people are ill and dying. I’m so upset that so many NHS staff are sick or dead. I feel that the government have taken actions to protect their own wealth and status only. What’s the betting that one of the cabinet or a Tory party donor is involved in the organisation that owns ExCel Arena!

I’m very angry that there are so many stupid irresponsible people socialising. We need to get real powers to prosecute them. Maybe get the army patrolling the streets. We are fighting 2 wars - one against CV19 and one against stupid, self-entitled selfish people.
