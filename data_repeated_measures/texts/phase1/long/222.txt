I am worried about my friends and family. I am also worried about the economy short and long term. I am worried about holidays that are booked - we currently have 3 this year that we must contnue paying for without knowing if we will be able to go or get out money back for them. I am worried about money as i have had my wages reduced and my partner is self employed in construction. This all leads to the worrying about the future of my household. The NHS is doing an amazingly great job but I worry about the strain on them. My anxiety is pretty high at the moment and I hate not being able to go out. I am hopeful that this will not go on for much longer as I miss my family and friends
