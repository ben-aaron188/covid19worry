I'm concerned for myself, family and friends and the potential impact this could have on them if the fell ill with the virus. My father  and we died just before lockdown (unrelated to covid-19)and we had a very simple burial for him - no church service, and only 8 family round the grave. This makes me sad, and a little relieved as I don't know how he would have coped (with Alzheimers and in a care home) if lockdown had happened earlier. My father-in-law is 96 and in another care home, and I wonder if we will ever see him again. 
Lastly, I wonder what the world will be like after the virus has passed and whether things will ever be the same again
