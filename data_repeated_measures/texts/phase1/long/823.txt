Covid-19 is very stressful, anxious situation. Not knowing whether I will lose my job. Then no money and house in the long term. Covid-19 is scary for everyone. I feel very closed in where I live and I assume a lot of people feel the same way. I do not know think it will end anytime soon. Maybe a 1-2 months time. It is a situation that no one has panned or dealt with before. The government are doing an amazing job to make sure all everything is in place and looking after as many people they can. Covid-19 wont ever go away but at least we can all try and stay safe in these uncertain times.
