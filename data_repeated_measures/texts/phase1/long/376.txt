Feel worried and a lot of it is to do with fear of the unknown. I am still working so the isolation part has not affected me so I cant imagine how some people must be feeling during the isolation period. My daily routine hasn't changed much as I still go to work but that in itself is worrying as I dont know what i'm walking into. Everybody at work is supportive but we all go through different phases of feeling worried, anxious, fearful, stressed, tired. Lack of equipment has not helped up till now either
