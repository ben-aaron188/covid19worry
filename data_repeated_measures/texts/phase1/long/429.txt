I currently feel anxious about how much longer I will be able to stay in my job. I am sad for those who have lost theirs lives or their loved ones. I feel sad that I can't see my family. I am angry that people refuse to stay in and are prolonging this and not caring about the consequences of their actions on others. I'm sad that my daughter will only have me to spend her birthday with her and won't see family or her friends. I'm also sad that a much longed for special holiday probably won;t go ahead, and anxious about getting my money back. I feel frustrated about being stuck in my house all of the time.
However I am happy that I get to spend more time with my daughter. I also feel well rested as I get to work from home, so slightly later get ups.I am also grateful for my health and that none of my family have been affected yet. I also love how everyone has come together to support each other and to praise the key workers, as well as the sense of community this has brought about. There have definitely been some positives!
