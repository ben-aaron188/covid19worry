I feel very uneasy about the Corona virus situation. Not knowing how exactly it is getting spread and the social distancing instruction is worrying. The uncertainty of when the lockdown will be over is very draining and the inability to move about freely makes me feel depressed. I also feel fear for myself and immediate family as the survival rate are not great.
Watching television all day and sitting in the garden doesnt feel fulfilling enough and my inability to go to work and interact physically with my colleagues at work is demoralizing. I worry that this will not go away in a few weeks
