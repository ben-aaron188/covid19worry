At the moment I feel very trapped whilst on lockdown and very frustrated seeing people outdoors NOT for anything essential. I wish people would stay in to flatten the curve so that we can go back to a more relaxed situation. I'm finding it hard not being outside, visiting family and even not being at work. 
I'd like things to hopefully settle in the next couple of weeks so that around May we can go out again, I also think we should be on a strict lockdown so people actually listen and we can get this over with.
