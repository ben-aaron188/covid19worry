I am anxious about the situation as a whole but mainly worried about the more vulnerable people in my family, however I know we are all taking precautions and following the correct guidelines at this time. Being in lockdown is manageable although difficult as I normally use my friends and busy university life to keep my mind busy most of the time, so being isolated has had a slight negative effect on my mental health but I am doing my best to deal with it. The only anger I feel about the situation is perhaps how the government handled this originally (but they're better now) and the people who ignore the lockdown rules who I feel are very selfish in a time like this.
