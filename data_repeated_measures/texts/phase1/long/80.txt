It's a very worrying situation because anyone can catch this virus and it doesn't judge who it takes with it. There is something going on and with the current guidelines people are still flouting the rules and going out unnecessarily. I can't wait to be able to move around more freely and go out when I want to and not worry about catching this deadly virus. Currently I feel anxious about getting this virus as I am a keyworker and have no choice to go out to work. I'm not worried about money as I always have something to fall back on.
