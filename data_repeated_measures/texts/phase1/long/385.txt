I feel frustrated about the number of people who don't seem to be taking the matter seriously and are still going about their day as normal. I work in a food shop and therefore still come into contact with a lot of people and I live with my parents who each have their own health issues, so I am worried about the possibility of taking home the virus to them. I'm also concerned about the long term effects on the economy and the number of people who may be put out of business or work as a redult of the pandemic
