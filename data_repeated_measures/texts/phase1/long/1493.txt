Feel worried for myself and family. When will this end seems like anyone who goes into hospital Doesn't seem to make it.
I feel a bit confused as to how long this will go on. I feel anxiety when I feel a bit unwell such as when i get a bit if tickle in my throat.  I have family who have underlying health conditions and i cant visit them. Seems a bit surreal within the lasst few week how the world has changed. I feel everything will not go back to normal as it was in January, people will be scared and traumatized.
