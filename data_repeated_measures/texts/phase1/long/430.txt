I am feeling scared about the fact I don’t know if life will ever return to normal. I’m feeling lonely as I am on my own in my home. I am very worried about finances, especially as one job was due to end at the end of the school year but obviously I can’t be searching for work to replace it right now. I am missing my friends and family and feel anxious when I think about the fact I don’t know when I will be able to see them again. I have to go to the doctors for blood tests because of my underlying medical issues and had a panic attack actually leaving the house properly for the first time. Looking out of the window everything looks great and then suddenly you remember that things just aren’t what you are expecting them to be, and it’s terrifying that you just don’t know what is coming next.
