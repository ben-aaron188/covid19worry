I am fearful for vulnerable members of my family although not afraid for myself. I wish that it could all go away as I feel it has impacted my life significantly and taken away so many exciting opportunities from me. I feel for the people who have high levels of anxiety regarding the situation, however personally I just do not think that it is likely to affect me or my family due to the relatively low levels of cases in my area, therefore leading me to believe that the precautions being taken are somewhat extreme.
