I find it very worrying. I am a key worker and have to continue working. I have vulnerable members of my household. I am trying to do the right thing for everyone but am finding it difficult to cope.

I find that even necessary tasks such as shopping are fraught with hazards, and other people not sticking to the 2 metre exclusion guideline. I also see family groups out walking and exercising, whilst I have to go out to work. I see other people enjoying having the government paying their salaries, whilst I donâ€™t qualify for any relief, and my work needs to continue regardless of my desire to do it. I feel hopeless, and without relief. I can only take refuge in the figures coming out of Italy and Spain indicating that they may be over the worst , meaning that we too in the UK may also soon be past the peak. I hope so.
