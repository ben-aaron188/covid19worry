I am liking the time I m spending with my family in self isolation but at the same time very worried about out health as well as everyone else. Thinking about how we going to cope financially, anxious about if we be able to go on a holiday this year. Upset about people dying globally. I am also worried about my brother and his family in Spain as it’s really bad out there with Covid 19. Feeling helpless that I can’t go out to get essentials as we all are self isolating and food is almost running over.
