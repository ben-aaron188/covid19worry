I feel relaxed. I'm aware of the risks and I'm doing my very best to mitigate against them & I'm also pleased to see others in my local community doing the same. I feel positive about the future & about life going forward from this point. I find it hard to conceive of the disease touching me personally, yet I know there is every chance that it will. I have concern for older relatives, particularly my mother, and for other people I know in the community. I'm trying to remain positive and look ahead to the end of the lockdown period whenever that may be.
