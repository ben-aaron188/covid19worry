I am very sad about whats happening in the world, all the people dying and suffering and not enough help to save them.  I really hate the world and China for this.  I love getting outdoors now we stuck in and no holidays this is depressing me big time.  I feel like life is never going to be the same again, all businesses are shut, well the majority of them, the government is giving money away to people all over and then when or if the country ever gets back to normal we will be paying for it!
my daughter is stuck at home no school, she is in year 10 and doing her gcses next year, I do not think that the current situation is fair and shes going to miss a big chunk of school which will have a profound effect, is the government going to make allowances for this?
