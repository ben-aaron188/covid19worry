I am very anxious about the situation and that myself and my family may get ill.  I am also concerned about the financial impact, both personally and for the economy.  I long to go back to 'normal' and the freedom that we all didn't appreciate.  I long for no more suffering and no more deaths.  I am very worried and concerned.  I am desperate to protect my family and keep them safe and I am trying my hardest to do this therefore I am stressed, tired and anxious a lot but trying to put a brave face on for my children.
