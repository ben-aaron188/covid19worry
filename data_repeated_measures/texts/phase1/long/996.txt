At this moment in time, my feelings are anxiousness not only for my own and my family personal health situation but also the public at large. Also at my age, I am anxious about where this leaves me regarding pensions once the fall out from all this occurs, IE level of pension investments and will they be enough to retire on?
The stupidity of people is also a worry in not abiding by the very simple guidelines, and I find it disconcerting that even so called experts in the media seem unable to comprehend a simple message, without resorting to melodrama.
