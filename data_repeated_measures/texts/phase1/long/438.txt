At the moment I feel like I am doing everything I can to protect myself as an individual from the Covid-19 virus. The UK government were a little slow to react and did not take it as seriously as I would have liked, but seem to be doing and saying the right things now. I am looking at other countries data from around the world and things are starting to look more positive from Italy and Spain, where hopefully the figures have peaked as they continue to ‘flatten the curve’. In America the state of New York they still seem to be having a real problem with getting the situation under control, I hope the president will listen to health experts as they monitor the situation.
