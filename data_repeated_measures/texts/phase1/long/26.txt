I think it's an incredibly sad situation that the world will take a very long time to process and recover from. I think it is essential we learn from this and invest more heavily in healthcare and scientific research, whilst also increasing political pressure on countries that fail to adhere to ethical practices. 

I wish there was more I could do to help, but at the moment I think the most important thing is to stay inside and refrain from social contact with others. I hope this is over soon and things can return to normal
