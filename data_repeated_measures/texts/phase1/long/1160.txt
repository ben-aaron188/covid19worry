I mostly feel frustrated, by the poor and underwhelming actions of the UK government. I feel they have done the bare minimum, responded far too late at every turn, and have been callous/unfeeling in their willingness to let people die. I also feel some anxiety for the wellbeing of myself and my family; that we will be financially secure during and after the crisis. I am worried thinking about my uncle, who has very serious MS and would be at huge risk of dying if he contracted the virus. However, I feel some hope/admiration at the way many people have responded, with expressions of solidarity and support for each other and for the key workers on the frontline, for example NHS workers. Then again, I feel frustrated that the NHS has been deliberately underfunded by various Tory governments for a decade, and now are being placated by 'thanks' and claps, when the most important thing the NHS needs is money.
