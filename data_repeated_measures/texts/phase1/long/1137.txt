Frustrated because people are still not abiding by lockdown rules and continuously going out and risking which means we will have to stay in even longer if cases keep building up also worried because I hope my family do not get it. Lost my job because of Corona as well so right now I am quite bored due to not having much to do especially considering its been around 2 weeks and i have already watched a lot of shows but this day to day is getting boring. Hopeful too because the government have been quite good even though at first they were appalling in their approach and not respecting this virus but the lockdown and making sure people stay inside with police patrolling the streets issuing fines has had an impact and hopefully we will be done with corona virus soon
