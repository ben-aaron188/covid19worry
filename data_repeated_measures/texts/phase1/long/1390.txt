I feel scared for the future of the world, and I feel sad that so many people have been lost. But I'm mostly angry that people keep refusing to follow the rules put in place to protect them. The situation wouldnt be so bad if people on the whole weren't so stupid and took the time to think about anyone other than themself for 5 minutes. All the selfish young people who were still going out with their friends, without thinking that even though they might get Corona and be fine they may spread it to someone who is immunocompromised or has preexisting breathing problems and wont ever recover.
