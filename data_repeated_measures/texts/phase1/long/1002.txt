Currently, I am very low mood wise. I reply on human contact and family support to get by on a daily basis. I can not do this at the moment with lock down. It is massively effect my own and my daughters mental health. There is no way of knowing when this pandemic will end and it is making it a lot worse not having an end date. It is also making my pregnancy much much harder because I need family memebers for support. 
I really dread how the pregnancy will go now with restrictions and not having support during appointments. I can not get important health checks via bloods at all just now because I can not go to get bloods drawn alone.
