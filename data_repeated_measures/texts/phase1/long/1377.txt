I am feeling very anxious and unsafe. I don't know what tomorrow will bring. I don't know if I will still have my job or not. I am worried if I am going to be able to pay for my rent and groceries in the upcoming months. I am axious and worried about how long will it take to everything go back to normal, if it ever will. I am scared about my older members of family, how they are going to survive. I am stressed when I will be able to visit my family abroad and how they will manage to live their lives.
