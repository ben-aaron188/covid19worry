I think in this country there has been a massive overreaction to coronavirus. I feel relaxed about the whole situation even though i am in a at risk group of people. Closing down the whole of society will not benefit anyone, it would have been a better idea to shield vulnerable groups and keep society as open as possible and build up health services to cope. I think the virus will have a negative effect on everyone even leaving aside the health situation, the economic effect will be worse. it will likely leave everyone permanently damaged.
