I am quite anxious and worried about the covid 19 situation. I am concerned for my job and the prospect if being unemployed as my job is in hospitality and has been directly impacted by the closure of such businesses by the government. I am worried about my elderly parents who live a long way away from me and who I cannot see or physically help.
I am worried about the impact that this will have on the wider economy as, the economy was just starting to come out of the recession and businesses were beginning to recover.  Now it looks as if we will be back in recession and full blown austerity. It is a very upsetting and worrying time for myself.
