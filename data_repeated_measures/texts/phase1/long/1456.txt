I feel the correct measures have been taken to prevent the spread of Corona however I'm very, very bored with being stuck inside all day every day. I have coursework to do but I don't have the motivation or desire to do it, my course is practical and online learning isn't effective because I learn more in a classroom environment. I go for a walk every so often but I don't like walking. 
I spend most of the day watching Netflix and going on the Xbox but I eventually get bored and watch Youtube on my laptop and sometimes I just go back to bed and wake up a midnight and binge watch Netflix again till 4 in the morning and go back to sleep to wake up again at 1 pm, just to do the process all over again.
Each day is the same but if It prevents the situation from getting worse then I'm at peace with staying inside.
