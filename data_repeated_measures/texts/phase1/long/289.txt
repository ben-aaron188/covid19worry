I am still concerned about delivery slot availability for grocery delivery. I am on the very high risk and vulnerable register so should be priority but the supermarkets have only just received the list so it's taking time to role out priority. I am obviously concerned about catching the virus but am at home for at least the next 12 weeks other than for my medical appointments. Getting a bit lonely. Missing seeing my mum, who I normally meet for lunch 3 times a week and miss checking up on her other by phone as she is quite elderly and has health issues too.
