The Corona situation is a very differcult thing to take in. Watching the news Daily, hearing about more negative news has been hard to take on my anxiety and I fear it so much. I'm worried about my loved ones as some of them have their own health problems that could put them at massive risk and that's the most scary thing about this virus. I fear it will get a lot worse before things get better which could go on to last months which will have such a negative affect on so many people mentally, physically and financially.
