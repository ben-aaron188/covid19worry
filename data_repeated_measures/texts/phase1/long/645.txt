I am mostly worried about the future and not so much about the present or about actually catching the virus (thought that is still a slight concern). Since a large part of my life and my family's life revolves around the airline industry, I am worried about jobs and what the future may hold as I was just starting to gain qualifications towards working in the industry. Also, the majority of my family lives and works overseas, and with the border closures we are unable to see each other in person for the foreseeable future, which also causes us concern.
