I'm resigned to living like this for the foreseeable future and just hoping that everyone I know survives. The number of deaths has gone over 5,000 in the UK today which is horrible for all those whose family and friends have died; I wonder what the aftereffects of all this suffering will be and whether anything is ever going to be the same again. I've been round to my neighbours checking that they are all alright today and so far so good but I just wonder how long it will be before one of them becomes unwell. I'm impatient with being cooped up at times but then I think, what if, and just put up with it.
