I feel anxious and apprehensive about the future and as a mother of young children I’m sad to be missing out on opportunities in the present. I also have a slight underlying feeling of anger towards the wet markets where the disease is rumoured to have originated from.  I’m happy of the positives and lessons that I’m learning in lockdown, I no longer feel that material objects or showy days out are needed to bring happiness into our lives, we are having more quality time than ever together as a family and there is a sense of community spirit in our neighbourhood.
