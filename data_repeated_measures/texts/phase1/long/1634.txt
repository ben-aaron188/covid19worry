I am angry that others are not listening to the government’s advise as they are going outside still and meeting in large groups. I feel slightly anxious that me/my family will get the virus as we still have to go outside to get essential things but that exposes us to the possibility of catching it. I’m stressed also because even though I am at home I am getting a lot more uni work than usual to do, which still has to be handed in by the same deadline. When I don’t have any work to do I am relaxed and happier because I get to spend time interacting my family and FaceTiming family not with me so I still get to keep in touch with them.
