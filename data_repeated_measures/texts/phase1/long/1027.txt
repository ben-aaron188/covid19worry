I am fairly worried about the virus situation, the least change in mine or my partners temperature, headache, cough, makes me wonder if I have caught it and sends my anxiety levels through the roof. I am extremely worried about my sons and grandchildren who don't live in the same household as me.  And I have an exxtrememly close friend wh is having palliative care and is not allowed visitors that I am so, so sad that he is in isolation, alone, with no family or loved ones allowed to see him in his last days.
