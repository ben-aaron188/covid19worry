My feelings at the moment are that this country is ill prepared to face this pandemic.  I think there are a lot more cases than is being reported in the news.  I'm also wondering who is leading us with the prime minister being admitted to intensive care and when are we going to turn the tide in our favour.  I am restless from being cooped up indoors and have recently been furloughed which brings money worries into the equation also.  I have written this as a string of conscious thoughts which are looping over and over in my head and kick back in with every coronavirus headline notification I get on my phone.
