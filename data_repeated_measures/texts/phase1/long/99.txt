Scared for my family. Scared for my friends who live far away or who are working on the frontline. I have two friends who are doctors working in ICU's at the current time. Happy and proud of the actions of the many of the people in the country to the events, but saddened and angered by the few who are breaking the rules and jeopardising their own lives and others.
I know I'm doing the right thing by staying home but god it feels horrible. I'm stuck in here doing nothing whilst people are basically in a warzone giving their lives.
