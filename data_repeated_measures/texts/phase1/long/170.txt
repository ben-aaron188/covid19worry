I feel very anxious. I don't feel that I want to do much at this very moment. I don't feel right what I should to do. I feel very uncomfortable and uneasy. I don't feel that I have enough directions and information what is happening around or what should I do. I also feel constantly distrust from information around me. I have also experience insomnia and nightmares. I have worriers practically about everything: how to go to the shop, what I will find in a shop, will my family be Ok, will I sleep tonight.
