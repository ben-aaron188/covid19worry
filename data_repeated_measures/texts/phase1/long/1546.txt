I am worried if my wife or I contract the virus because we have children to look after. I am annoyed that we can't go out and live our life as usual but understand that isolation and lock down are the best things we can do.

I am working from home but it is difficult to concentrate fully.

We have to home school but are concerned that we aren't giving our child the best education because we are not teachers.
