I feel ok with the situation, so far as things affecting me personally. I'm thankful that I no longer live in the 2-bed flat in London, but in a rented house in Devon, surrounded by countryside, with a garden. I'm focusing on the positives, in terms of time to do things I've not had chance to do for a while, and focusing on the business that my husband and I run. We can go for walks straight from the front door, shopping is sometimes less straight-forward, in terms of what's available, but... we can cope. My 85 year old mother is in touch with me, she's ok. My only worry is for the small businesses in our local town; I fear for them, and hope that most are able to survive. I know many won't be so lucky, and that saddens me. But the isolation side of things really doesn't worry me. When my husband's on a contract, I'm home alone during the week anyway, so in some ways, this is much the same!
