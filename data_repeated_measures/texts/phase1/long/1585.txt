The state of the pandemic at the moment is concerning for the western popultion as a whole. It saddens me to hear of the deaths caused by the virus on a daily basis. From my own perspective however, I am actively being very cautious as I suffer with Asthma and I believe I am high risk. I am managing quite contently in isolation and quarantine. I am a furloughed worked who will be receiving full pay from a stressful job in the live events industry. At the moment, I feel relaxed as i am finanically safe and am confident I can avoid contact with the virus.
