I’m feeling sad at the moment. I feel the government is reacting to the the issues opposed to being ahead of the game and this is causing a loss of life. I also feel sadness and disappointment in the public that aren’t sticking to the clear, simple instructions! The result of this will be an enforced lockdown which will have a negative impact on people as the warm weather arrives in the coming months. I’m sad that I can’t see members of my family that live less than 1 mile away from me, one of those family members is my 91 year old grandmother.
