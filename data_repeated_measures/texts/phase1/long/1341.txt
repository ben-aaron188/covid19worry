I am concerned about those with underlying health conditions and the strain on the NHS at present. I feel that not enough is being done to enforce social distancing and some members of the public are ignoring the rules which makes me feel angry. I am worried that it will take a long time for the economy to recover from this and will lead us into terrible debt and the loss of many businesses to enter into administration. At present, it has taught me how fragile our infrastructure is in the UK and that it could happen again at any time with more viruses.
