At the moment i am feeling anxiety due to the possibility I could contract it and recieve long term health effects like reduced lung capacity. I also feel my government, the UK government have acted on reactions and is therefor responsible for a large percentage of the mortality rate. I am concerned about the older members of my family and angry at the people who are still leaving their homes unnecessarily. The coronavirus has put stress on my 
business as it is difficult to get the resources i need and even if i had them, the customers aren't purchasing as much now due to fears that they will get the virus from a package.
