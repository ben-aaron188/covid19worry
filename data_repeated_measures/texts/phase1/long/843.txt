It's a time to reflect on how bad the world has become and people are beginning to help each other. We an only hope that a vaccine is discovered soon and we have every faith in scientists to do so. I do hope this is over soon. I am trying to keep positive and look on the bright side, but in the back of my mind I am worried about catching the virus and dying from it. I am confined to my house and am not sad about this, in fact I am enjoying being at home and and being away from the rat race. I don't know what else to say really. I'm on medication for serious depression and anxiety and am feeling chilled out/zoned out most of the time.
