I am feeling fine. It is like living the dream. Now I have time for doing lotsof stuff I want to do before. Such as learning new things, reading new books, watching newseries and films. However, I feel a bit anxious as I am not a UK citizen who lives in the UK. I feel safe, but still being at home country is different. For example, health system is different in my country. They care more. UK system does not care that much about us. In my country I can get an appointment for the next day while in the UK to see the GP takes 2 weeks at least in normal times. Now, it is impossible.
