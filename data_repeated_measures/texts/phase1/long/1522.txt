This situation could of easily been prevented by a rapid response by governments and if people respected social distancing rules. Not only that but the response of the US is extremely bad and proves that their current healthcare system is bad, as people cannot afford to get tested or be in treatment. There could be a lot more victims in the US than we think there may be. I also feel that China is covering up the amount of victims which is troubling. If this continues to escalate I do not think that healthcare systems across the world will be able to cope.
