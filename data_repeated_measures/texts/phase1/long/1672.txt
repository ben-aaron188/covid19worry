 I an feeling increasingly bored with days and weekends feeling like groundhog day, slightly anxious for food supply chain, it being squeezed, medical staff falling I'll and the NHS being overwhelmed and that of having to put mine and my families lifes in danger by something as trivial as going to a supermarket.
 Anxiety is also there in the realisation that with SARS and now COVID19, that this is only going to become more frequent and not less.
 The 'holier than thou' attitudes of those on social media also makes me want to invent a way of slapping people over https;
 The sneaking in of anti-privacy legislation is also disgusting.
