The current situation makes me feel incredibly anxious. i have never been in a place in my life when I was worried about being able to feed myself. Whilst I know shops are open and have plenty of stock, its making sure you can make full, nutritious meals with those ingredients whilst navigating a store which you can no longer use your usual routes in and people are increasingly rude. This causes a lot of anxiety day to day as I am fully responsible for cooking and shopping for myself and two other adults. I also feel absolutely disgusted over the behaviour of others at the minute, as they have no thought for other people. Their reckless behaviour could kill someone and the thought that their recklessness could even lead to me being responsible for killing someone is absolutely terrifying. The lack of leadership in this country is also leaving me rather confused about the whole situation and how it will progress, leaving me fearful of what is really to come.
