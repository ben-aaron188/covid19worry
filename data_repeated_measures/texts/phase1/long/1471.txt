I feel very anxious of how long this was last, how many people will die. And if normal life will ever be the same again.
Personally I am worried about job security and of course my family who are older, who I have chosen to volunteer isolate with.

It feels you have no power to do anything to help apart from stay at home which is frustrating. I would like to do more, but do not really know how to start as my village has got a really good support network.

I want to do more, but have no direction which makes isolation hard. But I also feel that is a selfish attitude to have with so many people dieing
