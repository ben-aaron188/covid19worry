I fell worried about my family, we are staying in and doing all that we can but I know other are not following this. I’m saddened by how many deaths there are and it’s going to keep going up. I just wished everyone would take this seriously. I feel confused as to why people are not taking it seriously. I feel saddened that this has happened and that no one was fully prepared, we were not fully prepared and I feel sad that people have had to give up ventilators and have died and that children are dying too.
