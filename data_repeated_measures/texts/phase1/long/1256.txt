I'm enraged by the government's mis-management of the testing that's needed.  We don't need an antibody test right now, we need to be testing for the antigen.  NHS staff first, patients second, key workers third, and nowhere on that list is politicians.  Nowhere.

I'm enraged by the promise of 100,000 tests a month for a test that doesn't exist in any meaningful way.

I'm enraged by the government's inability to tell the truth about the supply about ventilators, or to actually use the UK firms that could have started manufacturing them weeks ago but didn't because the government wasn't interested.

I'm frightened of my 73 year old partner getting the illness and dying.  He's in excellent health, but he's 73.  I'm a bit concerned that as a 63 year old getting it wouldn't be pleasant for me, but not as worried as I am about my partner's age.  

But mostly this evening while doing this survey I'm relaxed and very pleasantly tired. I've done a bit of cooking today, played tetris with the freezers, done a bit of gardening, fixed a couple of things, done a bit of voluntary remote working, walked the dog and had a thoroughly satisfying day.  I have no other concerns in the world, and as a result I'm very conscious that I'm in a privilged tiny, tiny, tiny minority and a very lucky woman.  I hate to admit it, but Lockdown seems very peaceful to me, with loud birdsong and no traffic.
