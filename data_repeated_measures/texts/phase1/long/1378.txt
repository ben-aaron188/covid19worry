I’m feeling quite anxious a out corona virus. Mainly because I think it will be a long time before lock down is lifted and I can return to my office for work.
My mood has already started to drop and i’m anxious this may get worse as time goes on.
I’ve started to find it difficult to concentrate while working from home.
I’m fearful of how many people are getting the virus and worried about it affecting my family, especially my parents as they are in the 60’s.
I wish the general public would all listen to the advice to stay at home.
