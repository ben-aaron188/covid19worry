I am unsure of what future holds worried I won’t see family members again and do things I enjoyed doing prior to virus. It has made me think what have a take for granted prior to this and how much people and friends mean to me.
Also worries about future virus that may come as a result of this one this was not expected and in cure climber worries that once this one sorted out further virus could spork from this one.
Also one cleared and all restrictions lifted how I am going to be affected financially I need to work and can’t because of the curfew and the risk to pass the virus on.
