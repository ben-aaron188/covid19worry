I feel a little surreal as if I am watching a film but when I think about it seriously and watch the tv reports it makes me anxious. I feel anxious that I might catch it but probably more that a loved one will. I do not know anyone personally yet who has the virus so it hasn’t directly impacted on me in that sense. I am concerned that the PM has it. I am concerned that I will run out of food as I don’t want to go to the supermarkets and am struggling to get online orders.I miss my family my friends and my social life.
