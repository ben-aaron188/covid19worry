I feel very nervous with the current situation - I dread to wake up and watch the news - as I don't know what I will learn or what is the bad news.
I tend to follow the news on a hourly rate to keep up to date and again there are some positive articles but then there are some negative articles, and for the negative articles I feel low again. However I try to keep positive and spend time with my family to avoid listening to the news and I don't like to receive any forwards from whatsapp as alot of them is fake news
