I feel very afraid and tearful, my mind is constantly distracted.ive lost my income,I miss my family and I’m scared for the future.

I find myself picking arguments with my husband because I’m angry and frustrated with him being home all the time as we are both used to being at work and are spending all our time together. He seems constantly angry at me and I don’t know why I cannot help our situation at the moment nobody can
