I'm not really frightened for myself but for my parents who are immune compromised and at are risk, I also have to continue working because I run a grocery shop so I'm in risk of catching the virus and exposing them to it.

The virus seems to be dangerous to people who are old or have health issues as far as I can tell but the deaths rate have been going up and I'm not sure when this will end. 

The government is saying everything is fine as long as everyone stays home but the death rate is still increasing as the days go by
