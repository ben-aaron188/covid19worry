Its a quite scary situation and i am a bit upset about it. Many people will catch the virus without even know and spread it easily. I think police should be much more strict and penalize most of the people going out. I see people use the situation going out no mater what which is not fair against old people. In situation like this i will be more than happy penalties for going out to become serious and everyone going out to feel them. Otherwise some people can go out other not. The other thing that should be done is everyone should wear mask to protect the 'others'. I think this is very important.
