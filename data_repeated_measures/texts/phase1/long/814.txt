It is a concerning and worrying time for everyone around the world. A lack of control in that there is nothing one can do to eliminate the chance of getting the virus. There is frustration and lack of trust in the government leadership and believing what they say. It is appalling about the lack of sufficient testing being done and the behaviour of public figures evidences a case of “do as I say, not as I do”. People have and will die, some people will be prioritised treatment over others, some will be tested who should need to be, whilst others will not be tested who should. The failure to provide adequate resources and protective equipment is inexcusable. There was a scenario a few years ago to test the ability of the UK to handle a pandemic. It found serious failings but little or nothing was done.
