I feel saddened at the number of deaths of NHS workers who have not been adequately supplied with PPE, these deaths are preventable and should never have occurred if they were given the right equipment to do their job safely. And that only recently they are being tested. 

I also feel for those who are dying not of covid but as a result, those who surgery been cancelled or those in too much fear to attend A&E with life threatening symptoms

I'm angry that we were slow of the mark, lockdown should have occurred sooner and more tests carried as well as contact tracing.
