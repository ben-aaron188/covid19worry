Not great, honestly. I'd just started a relationship with a girl who I really liked, and we both shared a lot of interests. I've never felt this kind of near-instant compatibility with someone before, and now I can't even see them because of the stupid-ass lockdown. Not to mention being stuck indoors while living by the sea, so I can't even relax by the beach because I'll get shut down for being outside. Being poor during this sucks too, and it's compounded even more if you're disabled. Basically, this entire situation is a shitshow.
