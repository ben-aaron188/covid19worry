I feel like a lot of people, me included, have been forgotten at this time, as a student. I want to have a good idea of the timeline we are expected to follow and how we are going to recover from this, also I want to know what I am supposed to do when my student housing contract runs out and the country is still in lockdown as I donâ€™t currently have anywhere to go so this whole situation makes me feel very anxious and potentially frightened with regard to my future financial situation and my physical wellbeing etc
