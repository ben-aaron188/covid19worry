I work from home so day to day my life has not changed too much.  I worry when going to the shops but I limit this to once a week and never go out of the flat otherwise.  It is a bit surreal but I have no problems carrying on with the government advice as long is helps.  I hope that we can all just follow the advice so that we can get through this as quickly as we can.  I do get rather angry with the people who flout the rules and go out to parks etc. as this is so selfish of them and is going to delay the outcome and also cost lives.
