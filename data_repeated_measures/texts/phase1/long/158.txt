I am fairly happy but I have been going out each day, usually for a walk but sometimes to run errands for my parents who are remaining in their house. I am a little frustrated at the media portrayal of people just being out in parks as doing something wrong. The pictures clearly show folk sittling appart. It seems to me that folk with cash and big gardens are trying to shame people who don't going out and acting sensibly. I think the government are doing an OK job but I really hope they don't try to become more draconian. When oit and about it is nice that people seem to be nicer to each other and I am hoping that this means we are getting past the Brexit issues. Hopefully the loudmouths on both sides can fade into memory.
