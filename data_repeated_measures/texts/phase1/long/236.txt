I feel extremely worried that my or my immediate family will be affected and may not be able to fight it off. My anxiety levels are constantly through the root and I am extremely irritable. I have recently been test for coronavirus myself and this makes my anxiety even higher as I have an idea of the severity of the virus. I find myself googling coronavirus very often and addicted to watching the news and numbers which deep down I know dosnt help me but whilst in the moment I cant seem to help myself.
