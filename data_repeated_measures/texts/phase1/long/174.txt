I am very frightened, the news has just come on that the prime minister has just gone to intensive care and suddenly I feel very vulnerable.  I want to pray, I hardly ever pray and I feel so helpless.  I have no idea how this will end.  I feel that the planet is saying “I need a rest from you and I’m punishing you like you punish me”. I want to cry, I can’t sleep and I am so very, very anxious. I am frightened for my grown up children who do not live near me, I miss them and hope against all hope that they stay safe.  One is a key worker, I just want them home with me.
