The situation is frustrating as people aren't following guidelines. I think if people did follow these guidelines it wouldn't be as bad as it is now. Isolation and lockdown are upsetting as we can't really go out unless we have to, which just kind of feels like we dont have much freedom. I believe the government are doing what they can, but even this is limited as it is a virus, and it will be difficult to stop. Overall, it is a horrible situation, that has worsened the mental health of everyone I know.
