Honestly, at the very beginning of the Coronavirus situation, I did not take it so seriously and I regret doing so. However, as we got closer to a lockdown, I got keen in reading up on this and found out how serious of an issue it was. As it stands currently, we are in lockdown, which explains as to why I feel a bit isolated, lonely and depressed. I'm also quite fearful since I don't know what the future holds for me and my family members and that anything is possible. I do have a bit of optimism and hope we can all get through this as quickly and safely as possible.
