Quite worried about it given the number of people dying, especially those around the same age as me. Having developed symptoms over the last 24 hours, I am becoming increasingly concerned for my health/wellbeing. Whether or not I will survive the next few weeks is something I never thought I'd have to be considering. Not knowing for sure whether or not this is the virus or just unrelated issues, due to lack of testing, only increases anxiety about this situation. Trying to relax is almost impossible as it's always on my mind and can't seem to get it off. Whenever I start to feel a bit better, I start coughing again and all the worry comes flooding back.
