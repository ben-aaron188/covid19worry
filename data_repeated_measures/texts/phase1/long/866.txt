I feel people are making the situation a lot worse than it is. And that a lot of people also try to.make profit off it. It's certainly something that needs attention and care, we all need to be careful, but the overreaction of everybody makes the situation immensely huge. Off licenses also try to make profit off peoples' fears and anxiety, and/or health conditions. It's really sad to be honest, but at the same time it's really a good ""mask off"" moment for a lot of people. You truly see a lot of the ""true intentions"" of people during situations like this one.
