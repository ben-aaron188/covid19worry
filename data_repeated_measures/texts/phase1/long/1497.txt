I think it's a bit worrying but Chris Whitty CMO has recovered and seems well. Nobody close to me has been touched by the virus so it does feel a little abstract and external. I think everything all feels a bit surreal; almost like a plot from a film. I am frustrated that a lot of people are flaunting the rules and seem to think that social distancing doesn't apply to them which seems reckless and selfish. I don't want someone I care about, or even myself, to become ill, maybe critically, because someone wanted to go and sunbathe in a park.
