My anxiety is at an ultimate high especially living with an elderly mother. Sometimes not knowing the unknown is the most frightening. You dread to wake up that of of your loved ones maybe affected and you may never see them again. i am aware that already two people have lost their lives on my road, people who i have grew up with. It's absolutely devastating that neighbours, who you have grew up with cannot join and grieve with the families. Its worrying that you will never really know when things are likely to return to normality, and though we have never experienced anything like this before we should count ourselves lucky this isnt war where we could lose our homes and run for our lives.
