At personal level it is really scary, because there is no cure for the corona virus and there is only so much that hospitals can do. The only thing now is to just wait that smart people around world are able to find vaccine for the virus and that the people who are in the intensive care are able to recover. The situation is very bad in generally, but I hope that the situation is not going to get any worse. 
I am also bit disappointed about the fact that some people still do not listen the government instructions to stay home and only if necessary to go outside. I find it frustrated that to decrease spreading of virus people should try to stay at home. 
Also, the reason that I am personally scared and I think everyone else is because we do not have enough information about the virus, and how it is spreading or affecting different people. Some of the people get mild symptoms and others get severe symptoms that might cause death. Also, the fact that there is only limited resources at the hospital for the equipments (masks, gloves, protective gear, respiratory ventilators and etc.) which cause the ones working in the hospital more potential to get the virus. Included in the limited resources is also the fact that there is not enough space in the hospital for people, so if you have severe symptoms there might be not for chance to get in hospital. That is the another issue, that even if you get severe symptoms and you get to hospital, how long you can get support for your situation until your body is going to fail.
