I dont necessarily feel any negative emotions against my current situation however I am quite worried because I have a slight cold. I can't exactly express any emotions against the current situation. I am well but have slight symptoms of the virus so I am scared just a little scared. I also wonder when this lockdown will be lifted. I want to have more information about the lockdown. 
 I don't have anything else to report but have to complete 500 characters so I am quite confused. I don't know what to write.
