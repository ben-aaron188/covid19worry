I am more worried about the lasting effects to society and the economy than I am about catching the Corona virus. 
I am getting used to the new way of life and am happy staying home with my family. We have a garden and safe jobs and everything we need. I'm worried for people who don't have the same luxuries. 
My kids are out of school and need things as a result of that. I'm stressed but trying my best to make sure we have everything we need. 
I'm tired of selfish people who don't follow the rules. I have told s lot of people off.
