At the moment I''m not really that worried about corona, although my partner is struggling to deal with lockdow. I work from home much of the time but most days will go for coffee and take the dog out for a long walk which I cant do right now.  I feel slighty anxious but not over concerned as the death rate is still pretty low all things considered. Bordem is starting to become a factor as I am not a fan of tv and I'm start to go a little mad. My main concern is for my employees, and for how long I can continue to pay them, while doing this study I'm also doing company accounts to see how much money the company has.
