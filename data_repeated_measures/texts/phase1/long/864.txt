The COVID-19 situation has caused me a great deal of worsened anxiety, especially bad as I suffer with it anyways. I am so sad that I cannot see the majority of my family due to themselves and myself being in the high-risk category. I have self-isolated for 3 weeks now and will continue to do so for as long as necessary to help overcome this pandemic! Nonetheless, it is still a rather scary time as it has been proven to impact anyone. The virus does not care who you are (nor can it) and it will take anyone's life. The unpredictability of the virus is one of the scariest things, as we do not know when the peak will arrive nor do we know if we can overcome this and restore the country back to its original sense of normality.
