I'm worried about what the next few weeks will look like. I live really far from my family and friends, so feel anxious about when I will get to see them again. I've also been feeling like I'm spending too much time pre-occupied with work and am actually working longer hours than I normally would. Although I really enjoy working remotely, I miss seeing my work colleagues in person and wish there were stronger policies at work that encouraged us to leave on time. There's also some pressure to accomplish something with this time and for it not to go to waste. I'm worried that I'll come out of this with nothing to show for it, which I know is silly because there's nothing I specifically need too accomplish.
