I do feel for all the people who are sick and as I have asthma I am worried. I wish the government would sort out the PPE
 The front line staff Are in danger. I try not to dwell too much as I am self isolating and not putting myself or any one else in danger. I feel we arent being told the whole truth. I have never lived through anything like this in my lifetime. I miss my friends and family. I am very lucky to have a roof over my head and a garden. I am safe
 Unlike so many other people. The fact this is world wide is very worrying. One good thing is that if this keeps going we may view capitalism In a different way. And if it is true our environment mag benefit. I truly hope so
