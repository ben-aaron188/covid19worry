I'm self-employed, in the Arts & Entertainment industry, so all of my upcoming work has been cancelled, which obviously adds to the difficulty in the current circumstances. My concerns about money and survival contribute to my overall mood.
As far as the virus itself, I'm hopeful. I believe I may have had it and recovered, and I believe what is currently being done is having an impact. I'm also interested to see that the situation is prompting some countries to try new ideas, such as Universal Basic Income. I'm worried that some vulnerable members of my family may fall ill.
