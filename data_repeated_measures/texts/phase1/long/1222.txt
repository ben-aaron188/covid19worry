I am not particularly scared because I am young and are more likely to recover from it and i know the procedure to stop the spread of the virus and know that I am not putting myself at risk. The most anxiety comes from spreading to other people who are not as healthy as I am, which is a horrible feeling. To see how many people have died from the virus has made me feel afraid for the families who have to watch loved ones die without being able to say goodbyes fully and have to see them die without being comforted in their transition.
