I feel extremely lonely and anxious. I havent seen anyone in ages and even taking the dog out a walk is really quiet. I live alone so I feel extrememly isolated and cut off from the world. I have been very lethargic and havent been doing much and the days are running into each other. I have also not been sleeping very well. My sleep patterns are all over the place and are usually resulting in me staying up until 5 or 6am and waking up late in the day. I just want to be able to go and see people and be sociable.
