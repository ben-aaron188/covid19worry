i think this is a very worrying time and i am confused as to how we are going to get out of the situation - the lack of clear ongoing plan other than lock down worries me. i am also worried for the health of my family and friends - not just physical health but mental health. its been very difficult to explain to my seven year old daughter. i am also working full time from home, home schooling and caring for three vulnerable family members who are in shielding. very difficult time for me and my immediate family. i dont want to go outside but have to daily as i need to care for others
