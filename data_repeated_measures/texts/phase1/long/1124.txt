I feel as if it is growing quickly and not enough is being done about it. There should be more ways to get tested and to know whether or not you have Coronavirus. I feel like they should implement a stronger lockdown with stronger punishments or those caught outside without a valid reason. For example higher fines should be put in place. But I also think people are overreacting buy stockpiling things like toilet paper and hand sanitixer which has lead to a shortage of these products and less those who actually need it without it
