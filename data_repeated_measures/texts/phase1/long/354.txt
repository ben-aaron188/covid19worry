I feel shocked at the high number of deaths especially those deaths of younger people without underlying health conditions.

Also concerned about not being advised to wear masks when in other Asian countries tries this has reduced the spread of the virus and ultimately the number of deaths.

I fear for myself and sister as we both have diabetes so working from home and keeping positive.

Overall it's the mental state of people in these troubled times as I feel stressed and depressed most days and if you have to keep unoccupied.
