I have just got back from a shift at a small rehabilitation hospital. It's fine at the moment, everything carrying on as normal.  No suspected or confirmed cases but everybody is waiting for the 'storm' to arrive. PPE is not available in quantities. We are being asked to use the same mask all day when it should be changed every 30 minutes at least.  This goes against infection control procedures which we are used to using and is worrying  for when we do get confirmed cases. It feels like the NHs is not fully prepared in the area where I live.
