I am worried about my family as several members of my family are vulnerable to Corona.

I am worried about catching it and passing it to them so isolating as much as possible.

Anxious about how long the situation is going to go on for. Miss my job and those i work with. Miss my freedom. Concerned about mental health with being in isolation.

Wish people would listen to the government and authorities and stay at home. Also wish people would not panic buy as there is absolutely no need when you can do your shopping once a week as normal.

Doing my best to have a routine and do a variety of things each day.
