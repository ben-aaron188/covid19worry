I feel frustrated that I am unable to participate in my usual activities. I feel anxious about my future financial situation as well as the state of my mental health. Most of all, I am concerned about the very vulnerable people in the society, for example the elderly. I am not very optimistic that people in general will care about them. In addition, I am concerned about the long-term economic impact and the effect that the pandemic will have on businesses. Furthermore, I am not sure how the National Health Service will deal with  the pressure and its long term future is very much concerning to all of us.
