I feel concerned about all the critical workers, like myself, becoming ill due to being forced into work. I worry about my vulnerable family and friends getting sick and becoming very unwell. I am worried about becoming unwell myself. I am missing my freedoms, but I understand why they are gone and am 100% abiding by the rules. I am worried for the prime minister and hope he has a healthy and speedy recovery. I am annoyed that the press are sensationalising and not caring for others. I am proud of the community spirit but anxious about working.
