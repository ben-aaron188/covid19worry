I wasn't worried about coronavirus at the start, however it is now starting to worry me. It worries me as we need to go to the shop for supplies, however this will be the main point when we could catch it. I have lost my dream job as cabin crew because of coronavirus, as our contracts were revoked before even starting. This angers me as I had paid Â£1350 to relocate for the job, this is a lot of money which has been wasted. I am also angry as I am currently only able to access job seekers allowance, so I am severely out of pocket. It doesn't bother me that we have to stay indoors. I have been keeping myself busy. But it annoys me that others are incapable of following simple advice to stay indoors.
