The whole situation makes me very anxious. I do not believe, as a country, we are doing everything to prevent the spread. I believe we should be in a full and proper lockdown like other countries. I fear for my children and their futures. My son is 4 and just about understands school is closed and we aren't allowed out and we cant see family and friends. My husband has been furloughed and that worries me as we're not in control of things. I hate going to the supermarket because there's always a minority of people who wont or dont socially distance themselves.
