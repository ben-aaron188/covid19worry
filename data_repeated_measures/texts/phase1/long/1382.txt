I'm feeling worried because I got arvc which I think would make it worse if I caught covid 19, I get really bad panic attacks aswell, so having this going around is really scary, I can't wait till they get a antidote for it, so then it can help people and people would stop dying in every country and now the pm is in intensive care shows how serious this is getting everyone needs to start listening and follow the rules, stay at home and only go out once a week it's not hard people, they should start fining everyone that's dosent listen to this, fine them a Hugh amount like 500-1000 pounds then people might start listening or even put them in jail for a bit
