I mostly feel worried about the people who are in a high risk category of getting the virus. I feel angry that there are still people who are going out and not taking others into consideration, as the sooner we self-isolate, the sooner this will all be over. I am annoyed that it is only getting worse in my country because people are not realising the severity of the situation. I also am sad that all the things I had planned are now cancelled, and I feel like I am grieving the loss of my time as a final year university student, but I feel safe and happy in the knowledge that I am not the only one experiencing this.
