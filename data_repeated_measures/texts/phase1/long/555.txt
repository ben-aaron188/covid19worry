I feel helpless and hopeless. There is nothing I could do apart from staying at home. 
I'm also quite stressed because of financial pressure. I will not get any financial help, and that keeps me awake at night worrying.
I'm a bit angry because the politicians were not honest about the situation when it first started. And the media have been misleading as well. 
I'm also angry that there are many selfish people who are not following official guidelines and not observing social distancing, bringing danger to every member of the society.
