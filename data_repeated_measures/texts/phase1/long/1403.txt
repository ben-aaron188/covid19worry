Personally, i'm okay and quite relaxed, I don't go outside and do as the government says.

I guess i can be a little annoyed at the selfish idiots who went out and defied governments requests this weekend, but overall and with reading that (even just for now) deaths have reduced, i feel okay, relaxed... 

This is a marathon, i've adjusted to the situation (not much mind) but it is what it is, no need to get angry, annoyed, etc. Instead of life going 100mph, it's slowed time, given time to re-evaluate, think things and enjoy the more realistic things we have in life. So i'm all good with that.
