Feeling very sad about being away from my family which are a flight away as I am here for Uni, I can't see my boyfriend, I'm in a room all day and have really bad anxiety which makes matters worse. It's disheartening seeing so many people still going out and moving between households when people on the frontline are putting their lives at risk to keep us all safe and it is highly unfair! The Prime Minister wasn't stern enough when he first discussed measures that should be taken and that has had a knock-on effect on how strictly people are following the rules!
