Currently I feel very worried about covid-19. I feel many people will sadly loose their lives. I feel the frontline workers are under extreme pressure and are not safe from the disease. I worry about my family and friends. I miss my normal life and my freedom. I worry how this pandemic is destroying many lives and families across the world. I worry about poorer countries and how they will cope in these times. I hope a vaccine will be created to beat it and save lives do that we can try and resume our lives as best we can.
