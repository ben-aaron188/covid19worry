We buried our uncle earlier today, I have been at sad funeral before but only to have about a dozen people present when there should have been hundreds just isn't right. It was just not right having so few people there and we are so used to having a big wake for a day or two and then followed up by a proper sendoff as a sign of respect and honour to the likes of my uncle who has just died.There is a fear amongst everyone that any of us could get it so we must follow all the guidance and instructions, self isolate and stay away from eachother for whatever time is needed.
