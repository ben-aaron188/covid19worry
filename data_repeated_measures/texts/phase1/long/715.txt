I am feeling very anxious about the whole situation both personally and for my country. I am very worried about the effect it is having on my family and young child and for the future. I am also fearful for what will happen to my country the UK especially as our Prime Minister is now unwell. I also feel a little angry at how this situation has arisen and if anyone or anything is responsible for it and if there was anything we could have done to prevent it. I am also sad as I canâ€™t see my extended family at this time.
