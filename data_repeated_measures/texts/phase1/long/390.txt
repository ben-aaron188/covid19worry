Best word to describe is anxious for my families and my own health/finances. The question of our unforeseeable mortality is playing a lot on my mind. I am Sad to see all the news of the affect it is having on everyone and scared that we will in some way be affected in even more ways than we've been so far. There is so much unknown it's like you waiting around for the worst to happen. But still keeping positive things will work out ok and hopefully better in the end. And feeling happy and appreciative that I get to spend more time with my partner and kids. Times like this certainly puts a lot in perspective.
