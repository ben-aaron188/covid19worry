I'm doing as much as I can to stop the spread to my loved ones. I have remained at home and have shown no signs of having the virus, and because I am not going to be going outside, I am not all that worried about catching the virus. All people in my household are following the lock-down rules so the fact we don't have it now means we likely won't catch it, hence my feelings of relaxation over anxiety. I am moderately sad because I miss seeing my friends and I had to move out of my university accommodation, but I know that it will be resolved in a few months and life will return back to normal eventually, so am not too concerned about the future.
