I've just come back from daily exercise with my son, it's about dusk and very few people were around. It was peaceful and I enjoyed the birdsong and talk with my teenager. It's certainly a worrying time but being outside in nature was helpful. I don't think the government's response to the early crisis was at all helpful and I am not a fan of the conservative party and its systematic defunding of the NHS, but I do hope that Boris Johnson makes a speedy recovery as we need him to help lead the country out of this disaster.
