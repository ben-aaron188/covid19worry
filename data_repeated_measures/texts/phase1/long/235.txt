I support the UK governments’ current strategy but wish that the lockdown had been implemented at least a week sooner. The warning signs from Italy and Spain were plain for all to see. I also don’t entirely believe the figures released from China and suspect the infection rates and overall death toll is far higher than reported. 

Since the lockdown being implemented, it has really frustrated me to see some people still ignoring the rules (gathering in parks, on beaches etc.) but on the whole, the vast majority of the public are complying. I worry about the exit strategy and whether or not there will be another wave of infections before winter. Although research on vaccines has been swift (it’s been fantastic to see the world pulling together on this) it won’t really be able to help for at least 18 months. 

Finally, I’m also extremely worried about the economy and how long the inevitable damage to that will last.
