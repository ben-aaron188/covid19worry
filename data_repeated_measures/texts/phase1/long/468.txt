I feel that the situation is so big it’s unclear where this will end. I’m still getting my head around how much this has affected my family’s lives and routine. We’ve reviewed everything from our jobs to childcare. But we’re looking at the positives and doing our best to stay safe. Communication with family is important and making sure we use common sense with keeping ourselves as safe as possible is a top priority. That’s the main thing- I think our priorities have totally changed! What matters now is our safety- not so much anything else. Who wants to be the richest person in the graveyard? I also feel guilty that our Carers and NHS staff and countless other Key Workers are out there taking risks for the sake of the rest of us. They’re pretty stuck and I’m sure don’t want to be in this situation.
