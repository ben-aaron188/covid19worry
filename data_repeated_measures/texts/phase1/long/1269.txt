I’m devastated to see many people dying, being unable to help or do anything besides staying in. It’s an everyday struggle to reduce exposure to news and find ways to balance it out with accepting that there’s little I can do. This crisis has unveiled the pain of inequalities and this breaks my heart. I cry every day thinking about those who do not have my privileges. Because people don’t choose to be poor, to be on the streets, to be in a vulnerable position and the indifference of the governments fills me with a mix of disappointment and anger. It’s also difficult to handle the anxiety of having family members in other countries and having to face many different realities and responses. The feeling of despair of going to bed at night and not knowing if my family will make it, how many friends i could lose, how many people cannot say goodbye. The only hope I feel is to think that this crisis will force the neoliberal system to change, we live in cannot carry on. That is the only hope I can cling on to. I try to go on about my day, work, walk for a short time, call friends but I can’t process the fact that at this time many families are mourning. It’s so hard to come to terms that this despair, angst, pain and profound heartbreak is the new normal.
