I feel extremely anxious about the situation, both for my health and that of my family.  I feel worried about the implications for my job and for my sons job. Things are getting worse all the time  for many people and I worry also about the financial implications for future generations. I have started to not watch the news too much as it was quite depressing, it was affecting my sleep, so I've learned to distract myself with other things which has helped. it's very sad to see that businesses have closed and people have lost their jobs and it's difficult to see how the economy will recover anytime in the near future.
