Very sad about the situation how slowly it was dealt with especially the lack of people bothering to self isolate make me angry and upset. I am very tired from working as a key worker and feel very pressured and worried that myself and family are likely to be affected by the outbreak itself, likely that i am also going to be lpne working soon due to colleagues self isolating which is making me nervous and upset also very streessed at the extra pressure this is putting on me leaving my family behind at home. Also very sad and missong my extended family particualry my nan having lost my grandad recently
