I am very concerned and feel anxious as I live with my parents and don't want to catch this as they may become very ill. I feel angry and upset that I can't book home food deliveries for them. I hear my colleagues in the NHS are not being respected and I fear going back to work due to the attitude of the public, who if they are being filmed will clap the NHS but you are not seeing the true picture of what these people are really like. I have not slept for 3 weeks and I am concerned for my health as this will make me more susceptible to picking up this disease.
