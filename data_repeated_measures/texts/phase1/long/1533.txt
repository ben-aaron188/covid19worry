Worried about the bigger picture but happy that I am doing what is asked of me and all I can in this situation. 
At home I feel I am keeping myself and my family safe, I cannot understand people who are flouting the rules of lockdown and are still going out.
The main impact on me personally is the ridiculous issue that shopping has now become, and having my preschooler home all the time, and we cannot visit grandparents.
There is a very real fear of the virus as it seems to be attacking v seriously people of all ages/gender etc, so I am doing all I can to hope I can protect me and my family - and my wider family I am trying to shop for 3 other households as well as my own as they are vunerable and have no other options.
