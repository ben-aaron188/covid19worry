I keep forgetting why we are isolating and those moments are very happy and relaxed. I then remember why I am at home and start to get anxious. I wish I could stay working from home but without the looming threat of the virus. I love spending time with my family but hate that we cannot see all of the family. Also I feel a lot of pressure that this time needs to be productive. Generally I am feeling happy but I worry for other members of my family especially the older ones and the ones who are unwell.
