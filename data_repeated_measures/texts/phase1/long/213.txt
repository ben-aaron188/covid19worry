I am worried about what is going to happen. I am worried about getting ill and leaving my children behind. I am worried about catching it from work. I miss my family dreadfully and my close friends. I am worried about the impact on my job and career. I am worried about not being able to buy food in a few weeks and my child missing out at school. I hope the country comes out with this and can build itself back up. I am scared that the prime minister is not going to survive since being moved to intensive care
