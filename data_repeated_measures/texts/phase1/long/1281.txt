My main concern is the long term economic impact of the virus. This is because I will be graduating university at the time where I feel the economic effect will be the most visible and I am scared that I will not be able to find a job. 
Secondly I am concerned about my boyfriend as his dad is showing cover symptoms. He is isolating with him and his sisters. 
My third concern is the health of the doctors and nurses. I feel like if I was to get sick now I would not be treated for anything but coronavirus.
