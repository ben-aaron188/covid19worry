I don’t feel worried about catching it myself, I’m young and don’t really care about myself. But I worry about my vulnerable friends and family, and about accidentally catching and spreading it to people. 
I feel disappointed that I’m anxious instead of enjoying the opportunity to do nothing. I can’t bring myself to do university work, everything feels so pointless. I’m sad and miss my friends, but feel very lucky to be quarantining with my housemates who I love. I’m sad that my graduation is cancelled, and that I will miss out on my summer job and seeing university peers for the last time.
