I feel worried as even people who are usually healthy are starting to die. I feel sad for all the people that have lost their lives and canâ€™t have many people at their funerals. I also feel very sad for people who have lost their family. It is a very sad and worrying situation but I feel hopeful that things will start to improve. I am wondering about when we will be able to go outside and things are going to open again. I also feel anxious about my family and friends health. I feel sad for all the businesses that have had to shut and feel sorry for those people who have lost their jobs.
