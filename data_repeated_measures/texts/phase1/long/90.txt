I am fairly worried about the rising death toll and what that will mean for my family and friends. However, I have been in self-isolation for nearly 20 days now and the crisis feels remote. I am relaxing and spending my time reading, doing university work, exercise and other activities. 

I wonder if I will be required to volunteer at any point during the crisis. I worry that, once my university deadlines have passed, I will feel a bit aimless and without purpose. I am trying to set myself goals in the long term to account for this.
