I am worried for both myself and family. I am also worried about the longer term effects of the Corona virus. It is particularly worrying for older members of he family who are self isolating but there is also significant impact on their mental health. We are attempting to maintain social distancing but this can be difficult, particularly in shops. It is also incredibly boring and restricting on how we normally lead our lives that leads to further anxiety. I am worried for everyone and also the ability of our country to continue effectively economically
