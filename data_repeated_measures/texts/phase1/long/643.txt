At this very moment I am nervous about this coronavirus and it's effects on myself and my family but I am also hopefully that in time a cure or vaccine will be found and we will be able to return to our normal lives, despite feeling that nothing is ever going to be the same after.
I fear what would happen to my children if I caught the virus or if my partner caught it again, I am fearful that they will be left alone and that terrifies me but for them I have to remain cheerful and optimistic and not to crumble under the worry and anxiety as they don't understand.
