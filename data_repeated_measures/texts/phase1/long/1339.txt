I feel scared and anxious about what is going to happen of the next couple of, weeks even month. The unknown is worrying to me. I feel angry towards the people who are not listening to the government ruled as they are selfish. I am extremely thankful for the NHS for helping everyone who needs it in this awful time. Being a key worker myself, going to work (in a nursery) makes me anxious as I don’t know what germs I’m coming in contact with, no matter how much I was my hands and use the appropriate PPE.
