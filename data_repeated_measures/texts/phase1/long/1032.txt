I feel very anxious that my family will contract the virus as my mother works for the NHS, and my brother is still going to work every day. I am worried about contracting it because I develop chest infections once or twice a year. Nobody is taking it as seriously as I am. I feel like the government should enforce a tougher lockdown as people are doing whatever they feel like. I also feel the government is responsible for this as they led people to believe that only the elderly will die from it.
