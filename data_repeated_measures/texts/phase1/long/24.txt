I am feeling frustrated at being cooped up but I agree that we should be staying indoors. I feel more positive about the situation since the lockdown - before this I was very anxious and I am not normally an anxious person. I still feel anxious about the lasting effect this will have on the economy and how long I will have to stay home without going to work. I am reassured that my mum, who has severe asthma, has been now been allowed to stay home from work as initially she had been required to work with the public and this caused me to be fearful for her safety.
