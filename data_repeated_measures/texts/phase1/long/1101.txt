i am very sad and worry about whats going on in the country, unable to leave the house and starting to feel depressed being trapped in and away from friends and family. Worried things will not go back to normal for at least half a year.
I worry that this could lead to depression for a lot of people if we can't go back to normal. Restaurants and bars have been closed for long time, lot of business will be forced to close down and people will lose their jobs.
I worry that my parents will get corona virus as they are at that age of over 70. Some of my friends have bene forced to take furlough from work.
