At this moment in time, I feel I am in a fairly good position compared to the majority of the UK, for which I am grateful. As I work in a psychiatric hospital and continue to go to work daily, not too much has changed in regards to my income, routine, interaction with others. However, I have seen the effects of Coronavirus within my hospital and via the news. Seeing the devastating effects it has had on others has left me feeling very sad and wishing I could do more. I’m not anxious, or fearful per se, as I am confident we will be able to overcome this and gradually return to normal. It’s been really lovely to see the nation come together in such a difficult time and there is a real sense of community.
