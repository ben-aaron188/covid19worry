It's a very scary time as I'm worried about family members and friends especially those with pre-existing illnesses.  I miss my other family members that I don't live with but am relieved the majority of people are following the governments instructions.

I feel very grateful to the NHS and the workers who are risking their safety and their families' safety to help others; they're incredible and are severely underpaid. I also fear that there isn't enough equipment or medication to help people and people will die unnecessary.
