i feel sad and lonely and scared , today my husband was confirmed to have prostrate cancer and i want to see my family and i cant. i feel scared.Once lockdown is over i can see my family again but its not the same talking on the phone as opposed to getting a hug and a cuddle.
I just so worry if i will ever see my family again , but then again a lot of people are probably hfeel how i am , I just wish they would get a vaccine and make us all safe again , this has affeted us all in diffrent ways but as my husband is on a pension at lease our money is not affected
