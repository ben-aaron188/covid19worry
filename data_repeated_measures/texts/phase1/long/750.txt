Concern that I am a keyworker looking after vulnerable people. Worried that I can't stay home and scared I take virus to the people I support or my family. Tired as having to work extra shift and worried about older family members. Find it hard to get time to go shopping without taking my 5 year old as my husband and I are having to work opposite shifts due to grandparents being unable to babysit. Scared in case I become ill and can't look after my family and worried about the economy after it is over
