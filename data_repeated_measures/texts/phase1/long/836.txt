I fear the situation mostly because of the large parts of the population (not just in the UK) that are not taking it seriously, as their actions threaten the survival of vulnerable people in the population. It is increasingly dangerous that some people do not listen to scientists, and I fear the lack of control that we have. I hope that better things come out of this. I also feel that mental health is taking a hit as people stay confined; I personally am lucky that I managed to join my family before lockdown hit, as otherwise I would be in a very bad place.
