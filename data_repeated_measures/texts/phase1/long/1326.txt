I feel very afraid that me or my family could be victims of this illness and feel a full lockdown is needed. I have elderly parents who I can’t go and see or go the shopping for and due to selfish people getting 3 home shopping delivery’s (who I know of) I can’t even get a delivery to me and have to go to supermarkets and be in closer proximity than I would like. It would help to have done more to increase click and collect availability as there is a way to keep people safe by allowing a greater amounts of click and collect to help people keep safe distance by just pulling up at the time allocated and put dhopping in the car and drive away.
