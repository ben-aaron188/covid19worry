Anxious of what lies ahead, when this will be over and if we will suffer more cancellations and delays in ‘normal life’. 
I am stressed of doing homeschooling for my 4 year old and being working from home and being a mum. 

My husband is furloughed from his full time job and main earner but I’m trying not to think about what happens after those paydays and how we will pay the bills.

I am scared of becoming ill and losing even more money and time, I am stressed of not being able to continue with normal chores and life.
