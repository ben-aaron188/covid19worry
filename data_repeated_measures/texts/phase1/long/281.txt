I am scared, anxious, worried and very angry at people not taking it seriously.
I am stuck indoors alone with 2 children, this is extremely stressful.
Scared about losing my job and where money is coming from, this makes me upset.
My job is my ""social"" life, the only time is see other adults. I am so lonely.
My children are angry and do not understand why they cant go to the park when other kids are there. They think I am being mean which also upsets me.
I am tired of not doing anything (I am actually tired).
