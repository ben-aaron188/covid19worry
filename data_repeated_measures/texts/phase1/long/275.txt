My mood fluctuates with the current situation. Some days I feel I am coping. Other days I struggle to get myself dress and find life pointless. I worry this is something we arenâ€™t able to fix. I worry for the future of my daughter and what impact this will have in her development. I worry for my nan and my mum and dad to have auto immune conditions. I am a SEN teacher and worry about my students and what will happen if some of them get coronavirus. Most of the time I just wish life would get back to normal. I miss family, I miss friends and I miss the structure of going to work.
