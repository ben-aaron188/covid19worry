I feel a bit anxiety but not too much ever since we are locked in at home.

I do enjoy working from home and does not miss waking up early in the morning for my commute to my office.  I am happy to avoid the rush hour every weekdays. 

That said, my weekdays and weekends feels the same and can be a feeling of monotony

I go for my daily jog to the local park which helps me reduce my mental stress and cabin fever.

I also enjoy seeing the local wildlife which makes me less stress and more relaxed
