We scared but wish the gov would do more to stop people going out all the time.  Our neighbor is acting like nothing has happened.  Going out every day and having her boyfriend visiting and visa versa.

With Boris being in hospital has hopefully shown people how important it is to stay safe, protect the NHS and save lives.

We need a lockdown like other countries.  I am scared, I'm scared to leave my house scared to go shopping and worried to death about my elderly parents who have had letters to stay inside.
