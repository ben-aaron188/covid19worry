I am mildly concerned for myself but very concerned for a number of friends and relatives who have underlying conditions. I am also worried that the economy as a whole in my country and internationally will take a long time to recover and that vested interests will be trying to acquire as much of the emergency expenditure as possible. There are positives too in that air pollution from air travel and cars/vans etc. has fallen dramatically which does cheer me slightly. Overall though, these are worrying times with no obvious end point and poor government response the order of the day.
