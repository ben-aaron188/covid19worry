I feel sad that the coronavirus has hit while my first baby is six months old. It means my maternity leave has been effectively stolen from me - I can't take my son swimming or to baby groups, and I worry about how it might impact his social development.

I do understand and agree with the measures put in place, but it's really shitty. I do have some worries about my family and I catching the virus, but I try to let it go as I'm doing all I can to limit my exposure and it's out of my control.

That said, I do think a lot of good can come from this disaster. The environment is getting a break and more people might work from home in future, people may take vaccines and the NHS seriously, and people have a chance to consider what really matters.
