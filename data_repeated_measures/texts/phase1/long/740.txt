I am not worried for my own health but I do worry about my family especially my elderly parents who live far away and do not have much local support.  I am concerned for my financial situation. I have been made redundant so will soon have no income and my husband is on 80% pay, so I worry about us getting into debt.  I also worry about trying to get a new job as many people will be in the same situation.  I mostly feel calm, but sometimes worried and anxious, I also find I am waking up in the night most nights.
