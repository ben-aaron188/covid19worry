I’m scared. I’m scared that if myself, my husband or my young kids get ill that we’ll be separated. I’m scared of what the world looks like on the other side of this. I’m scared my elderly parents in Australia might fall ill and I’ll be trapped in the UK. I’m sad that my Pop in Australia is about to turn 100 and won’t be able to see any of his family. I feel sorry for the NHS workers who jobs place them in an environment surrounded by this virus. I feel safe in my little bubble, in my house, garden and local park but as anxious when the groceries are delivered. I am thankful I can still get deliveries. I’m thankful I gave birth three months ago when i could choose a homebirth with my family close by. I am happy when online purchases arrive as it feels like a slice of the normal but feel guilty that they may not be considered essential and are wasting the resources of the mail service. I feel guilty that I’m on maternity leave and not working even though my job isn’t one as a key worker
