I feel anxious for my family, especially about my mum and dad who I live with as I work in sainsburys. Thinking that i could bring it home to them upsets me because i would never want to give them this disease. I dont mind being in lockdown though and i have really enjoyed spending the extra time with my parents after being at uni for a year. I am cherishing the days with my parents as this is probably the longest i will ever spend living with them again. So right now it is a very bittersweet time of worry but also happiness with my parents.
