I feel very anxious about what is going on and I miss seeing my family. I am worried that friends and members of my family may catch Coronavirus - especially the people most vulnerable and those people who are key workers. I donâ€™t feel confident that the government have this under control. I hope people are taking the lockdown seriously and are staying at home. I am looking forward to this being over. One positive is that I am glad I can spend more time at home with my immediate family and feel lucky in that respect.
