the pandemic has completely ruined what little stability i still had gained in my mental health, and made my symptoms surrounding fear of illness and dirt and obsession with handwashing and cleanliness so much worse that I am unable to see how i will return to the progress i had made before the pandemic.
having OCD and having the world tell you that if standards of hygiene are not kept up then millions will die has led to my compulsions being stronger than ever, and having to remain inside where they can run amok in my head is driving me beyond the point of insanity
