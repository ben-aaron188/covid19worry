I'm sad for everything I see on the tv - about the incredible job the NHS staff are doing to comfort and support and ultimately cope with the demands of a horrible situation right now. I'm sad that people aren't able to go out as much as they normally can, particularly with the warm(ish) weather, and it being the start of the Easter holidays. It's particularly tough now because we're coming - at least it seems - towards the peak, in 7 to 10 days I think. On another note, I am feeling extremely lucky that I haven't been affected by it so far. I'm sad for everyone who suffers because of this.
