The Coronavirus situation is quite serious, and I am disgusted with the government response. Boris Johnson has failed to act in good time, they have not been aware of its scale even though scientists have sounded the alarm for months. His chief scientific advisers have catastrophically mishandled this and will result in many thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths.

From testing not being readily available, and a lack of PPE for NHS frontline staff, to the government stance of herd immunity akin to genocide, someone must be held responsible from the UK government. Anger overpowers and other feeling that I have with the Corona situation.
