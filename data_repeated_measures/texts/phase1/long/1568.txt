I feel really unsettled and anxious. I do not like the uncertainty of it all, the feeling of uneasiness and not knowing what will happen and when. I try to avoid reading too much about it online or watch the news too often, but at the same time it is impossible to avoid. I also want to know what's going on at the same time, even though it is scary to hear. I just hope that what we are doing is enough and that things get back to some sort of normal soon. I also hope that everybody is taking this seriously and following the government guidelines.
