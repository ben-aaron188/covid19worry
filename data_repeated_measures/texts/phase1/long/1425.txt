i feel anxious when i go out into public, its going to be difficult going back to normal everyday life. I feel safe at home but going outside is unusual as I have to stay away from others. Im in the vulnerable category so I need to stay safe and away from others. Im scared that if I get corona I might not make it. Staying at home is hard because I miss going out with my friends and going to football matches. Although, I know it is lives before anything else. I appreciate the hard work the NHS is doing in these tough times.
