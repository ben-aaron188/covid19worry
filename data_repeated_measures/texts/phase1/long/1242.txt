Worried about my own wellbeing and the wellbeing of my family and friends,
Worried that I cannot go seek medical attention for other issues as I face an increased danger of contracting the virus if I go to these places.
Can't leave the house as I'm severely asthmatic and genuinely feel as though I may die.
Haven't left the house since March 22nd, and I'm worried about how long I will be inside with limited sources for food and supplies.
Worried how my job and the economy will be affected after this.
