It has quickly become normality. I am concerned for friends and family in terms if how they will be effected if they get the virus. It is also concerning that there doesnâ€™t really appear to be an exit strategy at this point. The other main concern is how we will rebuild the economy, poverty is likely to be a major issue particularly if the lockdown continues much longer.  I am fortunate in that I am a key worker so do not have any immediate concerns relating to work. I am generally pretty relaxed and would go as far as to say that I am actually enjoying the isolation.
