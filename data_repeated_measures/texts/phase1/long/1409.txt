I am very anxious about the Corona situation. More and more people are dying every day and people are not allowed to have the send off's they deserve due to social distancing rules. Being separated from family is difficult and it is hard explaining to young children why they cannot see their friends and loved ones. I am also pregnant currently so it is a very worrying time. Not only do I worry about me or a member of my household contracting the virus, I am worried about the implications social distancing may have if they are still in place for the baby's birth and newborn period. To not have my family by my side or to be able to meet my baby after they are born would be really upsetting.
