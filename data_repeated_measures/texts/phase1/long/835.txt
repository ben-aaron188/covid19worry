The whole situation is in itself concerning. Having to stay inside for the possibility of months is quite depressing, but having said that, the whole of the UK uniting and staying inside with family and caring for each other is a beacon of hope. Messages from the Queen and the government have been inspiring, and i remain determine that we shall all beat this together. The death rate is the most concerning, and how seemingly healthy people can crash and become unwell overnight is concerning. But, remaining indoors and isolating has settled any nerves I have about contracting the virus, or any family contracting it.
