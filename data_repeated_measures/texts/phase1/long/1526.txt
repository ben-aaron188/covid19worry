Worried and anxious about catching coronavirus, and potentially passing it on to my husband and 6 month old daughter.  Having to self isolate/shield for 12 weeks as high risk so feeling very disconnected from the world.  Missing family and friends  very much.  Worried about how this is going to impact the economy and the country afterwards the pandemic has died down.  Worrying about mine and my husbands job security.  Husband furloughed so worrying about finances, paying bills and mortgage etxc.
