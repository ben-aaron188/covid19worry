As a student, my main concern right now is how I feel I might not be able to keep up with online classes as well as regular classes, and how that might affect my performance in university. There's also the fear of carrying the virus around without noticing it in the first place, and affecting my younger family members, that I temporary currently live with, I had to go back to living with my relatives, due to the situation. My mother is also stuck abroad (France) since March, and I haven't been able to see her, nor do I know when eventually will.
