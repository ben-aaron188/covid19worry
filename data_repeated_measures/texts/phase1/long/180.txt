I feel I and my family are doing all we can to try and prevent the spread of this virus. Myself and my daughter have to work so apart from going to work and essential shopping I don’t leave the house, I have on one occasion gone for a walk but I don’t do this typically every day. It is worrisome but the situation cannot be helped my feeling anxious and worried about it won’t change anything. As long as I follow the advice given I’m confident that I And my family will remain well. I don’t feel this situation will be easily resolved, I feel we have a long way to go, and this could go on for many many months if not longer.
