Currently I am very worried about the corona virus.  People here do not seem to be taking it seriously.  I am a student radiographer about to go into emergency practice and my wife is a midwife.  We are having to manage childcare between us and it really angers me to see some people not heeding the government advice about social distancing etc.  I do hope we can make it through this, but I think the UK is going to follow the same route as Italy and I think lots more people are going to die.  I am also very angry at China and really feel something needs to change in the way China conducts it's business in the future.
