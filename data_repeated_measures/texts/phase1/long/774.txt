I don't feel too concerned about Corona. When the emotive take on Corona is removed the stats put it back into perspective and the chances of catching it, let alone it causing serious illness or death are in reality quite small.
What is more concerning is that it is very clear that worldwide Governments contingencies are woefully inadequate to deal with such incidents. 
The UK in particular has fallen woefully short on testing capability.

Am I scared of Corona, no
Do I worry about Corona affecting me/family, no
Am i concerned about the death rate, no
