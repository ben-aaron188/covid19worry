Concerned about my vulnerable father and my partner who smokes. Concerned that I could be a victim of this virus and leave behind three children. Concerned that I live in a densely populated inner city area where nobody seems to be abiding by the lockdown measures. Worried that when we catch it the hospitals will already be on their knees and will not be able to provide care for us. Scared that they will overlook my partner because he is an immigrant. Scared that my partner is more likely to catch it because he is BAME. Worried about having nothing in place financially for my children if I do become ill.
