I feel like it is under control and that the correct measures have been put in place by the government. Although the social distancing measures are annoying, it will be worth it as it will reduce the number of new cases and means life can get back to normal quicker. Staying at home is getting boring although allows time to develop as a person such as; doing more exercise, learning a new skill. 

I am annoyed at people ignoring the social distancing measures as it is selfish and annoying for the people who listen to the rules. If everyone stayed at home we could deal with covid quicker.
