I feel quite anxious about the situation at the moment because more and more people are getting sick and dying everyday. I am still working and that makes me worried too. At work we have to sanitise which is positive but it still makes me more anxious. I work processing benefits and there's lot of sad stories that I hear from people everyday. Sometimes this makes me upset and it means that I take these feelings home with me. It makes me sad and anxious during my free time In the evenings, although I am grateful to still be working just for some Human interaction
