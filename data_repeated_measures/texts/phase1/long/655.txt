i feel very sad and have lots of anxiety at this moment in time, but i am trying to keep a good positive attitude and hopeing that this is going to end right now, it to me, is like a bad dream and out of one of the sci fy books i read, i still can not believe what is happening and i cant see any thing positive happening right now. feel sad for people who are ill and losing loved ones and know it could happen to me and my family at any time, sad for my daughter who can not work right now as a flight attendant as she loves people, but happy she is safe and we are all alive
