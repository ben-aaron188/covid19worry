This is such a scary situation and aside from physical isolation, it’s also lonely in regard to how the government interacts with us. We’re not being told enough and not being given enough support or clear plans. This creates feelings of anger, fear, anxiety and dissociation. We don’t know when the situation will be resolved so we can’t make plans to look forward to or plan ahead in terms of career or relationships. The public as a whole aren’t educated enough to follow have guidelines we’ve been given and so we’re going to be in this situation for a long time, we just need a lot more strict guidance through this.
