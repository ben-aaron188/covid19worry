I am worried that two seemingly different people can get it and show such different symptoms. So it’s not just fearing that I get it, but how bad I will get it. I am a key worker and I worry that I am having to change my life to ensure that I don’t spread it to other people. I am angry that I am having to stay indoors and the virus is still spreading. I thought this would be over by now and we’d be back to normal but I fear it will still get worse. I am happy that I am doing what I can to stop the spread. I do not enjoy watching the news as it seems to just be bad news and never about good things
