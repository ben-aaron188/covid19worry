Coronavirus is a virus none of us understand. That is why I am very worried. The scientist believe they know what they’re dealing with, but yet haven’t found a cure or something to slow down the virus. I live with my grandmother who is very old and has health conditions. I am not leaving the house for anything, not even food; we get that delivered. I make sure to wipe everything down that comes into the house. However I am doing all of this, and we still have the public going out in groups and seeing their friends/families. The government need to crack down before this virus kills every last one of us.
