Very anxious. Trying to avoid media as constantly reports the negatives which makes the fear and anxiety greater. 

Feeling very lonely and isolated and distant, struggling with positive mental health and have not left home at all in 3 weeks. Very twitchy and anxious for this to all be over but a fear that it may not be over anytime soon. 

Feeling very lonely and that this will not end well, also have medical issues so worried that if I am to catch anything then it could cause serious problems or death, which in turn has caused greater stress. Slowly running out of food which is not ideal either and having no supermarket local or any deliveries for weeks is also causing a huge impact. 

The overall feelings are of fear, uncertainty and anxiousness.
