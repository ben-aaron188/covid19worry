I feel that countries are trying to work together and watch how each other responds to the situation and what we can learn from each other. But I feel sad that so  many people have died and in particular that nursing staff have lost their lives when they have helped so many people. I also feel scared about how we will exit the virus and what the economy will be like afterwards. I am worried for my job and that of my husband, who is self employed. I also feel sad that the weather is so nice but no one can be out there to enjoy it.
