I feel concerned for those who lose people to the virus and I am very worried about my Mother who has dementia and is living alone.

Feel worried about those that work in our National health service that they don't have proper protection.

I am concerned regarding  the future economy of our country and individuals impacted financially by this.  Not sure how long this will go on for and the unknown impacts too.

Particular concern for those countries who do not have great medical care or are unable or unwilling to provide economic support to their citizens.

I am not feeling well today, tired and aching.  Not sure what else to say as don't want to type rubbish
