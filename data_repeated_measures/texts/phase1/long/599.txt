This is such a difficult position to be in. It is definitely the uncertainty of not knowing when this situation will improve that I find most difficult to handle. I am scared that my family, my loved ones or myself could catch the virus. Reading the daily gloomy news from across the globe is so sad and makes me feel incredibly helpless. Knowing that I will have to do the weekly grocery shop soon feels me with dread. I also find it hard to explain to our children what is going on. They are way too young to fully understand, but they know that life looks a little different right now.
