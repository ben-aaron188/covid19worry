I feel anxious about the unpredictability and uncertainty of the situation. The fact we dont know when the lockdown will be, lifted, when we will be able to travel abroad, when we will get a vaccinations is all stressful. It's scary to think what life will be after all this, will it ever be the same again? I have anger towards the people who are not following the government advice, if we all listen the curve could have been flattened more. We could be back to normality earlier. I am annoyed at the fact that I could have been working many more hours at my part time job to earn more money but instead I am stuck inside just existing, sleeping pattern is all over the place, and appetite is gone.
