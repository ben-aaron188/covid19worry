I feel relatively relaxed in my current situation but anxious about how this is going to affect the Uk. i feel anxious going to the shops, it seems very stressful doing that but I  limit myself to once a week. I am also trying to keep myself busy so not to let my thought get carried away and over think the situation. Learning new skills keeps my mind focused and in a relatively happy mood. 

The main thing that worries me is what if the older members of my family who are high risk become sick with the virus, what would happen to them, this is what causes me the most worries.
