It's a strange time nowadays. There's an undercurrent of what there might be lurking under everyone you meet in person and it can hamper socialising with people. I hope it passes by quickly. I'm also wondering what the political ramifications are because of this. How will the politicians react going forward? Boris Johnson had to be admitted to hospital so who else knows what might happen to the political parties if someone dies. I think it's going to be a case where people will have to accept Covid-19 as another regular disease people get much like the common cold/flu. It does appear to have a higher death rate and our hospitals doesn't want to handle the sudden influx of sick people.
