there seems to be worry every time my head wonders, every time I try to take 5 mins to breath and have a minute I cant stop the wondering of my mind back to what if's.  Then the tightening of the chest with another panic attack brought on just by the thought of all the what ifs.  Trying to sleep but the cycle of worry's keeps reappearing and the thinking about keeping me and my family safe and my current medical problems getting worse and the what ifs reoccur. Knowing that I had important medical tests for an infection already that had damaged my brain and them being put on hold causes me to panic in case I lose any more of my eyesight and not being able to do anything about it.  But then I have to stop and think that at least I'm here and my family is here for now and not with covid-19.
