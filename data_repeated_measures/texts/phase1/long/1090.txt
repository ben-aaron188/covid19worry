Anxious that I might catch it, anxious that someone I love might catch it. Anxious about how dangerous it can be and what the possible outcomes are as well as the worry over the practicalities of going to hospital when you can't be visited. Stressed by the social distancing measures and how people don't stay far enough away when you go out. Unsettled by the lack of firm plan for the future and the uncertainty for my employment and that of my partner.  Worried by the long weekend and how we can keep ourselves entertained if we're unable to go out of the house.
