The current Corona situation is completely consuming - my 8-year-old daughter is required to shield due to her health issues and as a single parent, it means I'm with her at home alone. I feel engulfed with so many emotions; relieved that we're not ill at the moment, petrified if my daughter does become ill, lonely beyond imagination yet guilty for feeling any of this when we're at home where it's safest to be at the moment. 
I feel helpless and dependent on the kindness on the others to ensure we have food and essential supplies.
Ultimately I feel scared for the first time in my life as a parent that I can't absolutely guarantee my daughter's health.
