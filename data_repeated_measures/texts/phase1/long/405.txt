I feel so much anxiety and stress and i fear for my children and elderly  parents as my dad has heath issues
And my husband also has breathing  issues. Neither of us can work and have been furloughed. I cant  see any way this can emd anytime soon it just appears to be getting worser and  when ever i turn  on the news its just sadness and doom and gloom. I just hope my family  and friends  and 1 all get through these unprecedented  times. 
Life just is so difficult as thr 4 of us live just in a small appartment which also causes stress and tension
