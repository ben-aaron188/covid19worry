I am quite worried at the moment. I have not been sleeping well, which is quite unlike me. My dreams are rather scary at the moment. I do feel a sense of relief when I wake up in the morning that I don't actually have to go into work, but then I remember the reason why, and I get quite anxious. I am always thinking, what next. All through this though, I try to reassure those who are older and more vulnerable than I am.
I would hope that my anxiety level doesn't cross the telephone divide as I wouldn't want them to know just how scared I am. I am also wondering if I should discuss with my family about whether I would want to be resusitated if the worse should happen.
