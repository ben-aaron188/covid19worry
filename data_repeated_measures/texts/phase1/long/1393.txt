Lockdown is doable, what is difficult is the uncertainty over the future, particularly the impact on my child's education and lack of ability to socialise with other children . 

I worry about our health and that of friends and family.   I feel sad about not seeing my parents and worry how long they can cope with isolation.  

I worry about food supplies, although I have been lucky with deliveries.  

My anxiety is actually less, as there is so much less to plan and do.  But at times I worry about how long this will go on for and what sort of society will be left.  

I feel very cross when I see people not complying with the guidelines, for eg my neighbour has her family visiting every day.
