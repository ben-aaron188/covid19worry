At the moment I feel worried that myself or family may have the virus but not know.  One person my partner worked with has died from the virus so we are aware of quickly and devastating it can be. When I go to shop for food I am anxious that I may come in contact with the virus.  I feel like a portion of society are not taking the situation seriously enough.  The government should introduce stricter lockdown plus tougher punishment.  I am worried about my children and the impact this will have, they miss school and their friends.  We try to fill the gap but it is still a concern.
