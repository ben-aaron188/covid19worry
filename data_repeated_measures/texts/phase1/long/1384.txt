I feel like I want to be angry about the whole situation, but I don’t know what to be angry at.  I find it difficult to get my head round just how quickly everything has changed.  I worry about how things will be in the future. I feel like I cannot plan anything for any time as I don’t know what will be happening. I feel like I can only live from day to day, one step at a time. I can’t see an end to things at this point in time. I have travel plans for later in the year but I have no idea if I’ll be able to go. I worry about losing people I’m close to. I know things are never going to be the same ever again and I hate that uncertainty.
