I am concerned for older members of my family as they could be seriously ill if they were to catch this. I’m also feeling sad about not being able to see family & friends and not being able to go out apart from my one walk a day. I feel positive that we will get through this but find I have good days and bad days. Now that the prime minister is very unwell with Coronavirus this has made me more anxious as it almost has made it more real. I’m thankful that I have my husband and two children living me so that I’m not alone each day. I am also thankful that my family have been unaffected by this virus so far. I also appreciate my freedoms and loved ones more than I did before this situation.
