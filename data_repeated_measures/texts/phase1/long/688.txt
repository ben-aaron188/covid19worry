I feel very anxious about the current situation and what is occurring in the world, I also feel anger at all the people who aren't abiding by the rules and are serving their own selfish needs. I can't wait for things to go back to normal and can only hope people still have jobs, will be able to resume their life without having had too much upset and I hope now, after all the hard work and having shown everyone the good they do, the NHS will be better funded. I miss being able to walk outdoors but I understand the safest thing to do at the moment is to stay at home. I am trying to make myself feel better by reading and tidying the house, getting odd jobs done with my partner.
