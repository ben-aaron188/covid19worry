I feel anxious whenever I leave my home to get food supplies. I feel sad and upset at the amount of lives being lost both here in the UK and across the world. I feel anger towards the members of the population that continue to go out and do as they please whilst the rest of us are trying to keep to the rules. I feel annoyed at the government for not giving us stricter rules. South Korea have done what everyone should do. They never had a vicious peak like we are having. I just want us all safe and well, I want this all to be over.
