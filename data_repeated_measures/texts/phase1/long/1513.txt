I feel annoyed that I am not allowed outside my house, I feel bored and unhappy occasionally because I miss being with friends and family too. I spend most the time playing video games and football in my garden. Currently I'm eating cereal and watching Netflix but I just wish that this Coronavirus could be over soon and we could all get finished with this and continue our normal lives. After this over and cleared I will throw a huge houseparty around my neighbourhood and it will be a blast. I am mostly worried about my parents as they are old. My children and my partner have been safe and show no symptoms. I also show no symptoms.
