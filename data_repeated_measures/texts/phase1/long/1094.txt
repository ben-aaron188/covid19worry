I feel at this point that we've settled into our lives in this new routine. I'm not struggling with any of the measures put in place and it's been great for my partner to get to work from home. Although I of course hope the situation improves quickly from a public health perspective, I could personally maintain this life in lockdown for a few months quite happily assuming my personal situation doesn't change much. Some positives have been more time for exercise (using fitness videogames) and leisure activities, and discovering new ways to interact with friends and family while apart.
