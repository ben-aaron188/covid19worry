I feel that my govenment is doing a good job to try to bring the situation under control.  I feel anxious to know when this will end but calm that my family will be ok as we are at home and not putting ourselves and others at risk.  I feel anxious about other members of my family that I can't see at the moment but we are in regular contact.  I also feel annoyed at people who don't follow the lockdown rules as they are putting others at risk.  I am thankful to all the people who are still working and putting themselves at risk.
