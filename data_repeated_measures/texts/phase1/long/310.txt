I'm terrified. I constantly worry about catching the virus and dying..
I'm not allowed out of the house at all as I am in the most vulnerable group so am feeling very depressed and tearful.
I think it has all been dealt with badly by the government. They should be arresting people who are going out for no real reason these selfish people are killing others with their stupidity.
The sooner people realise how dangerous this virus it's the better, sadly some people just don't care and think the rules don't apply to them.
