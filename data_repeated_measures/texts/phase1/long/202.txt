The current pandemic is a very worrying time for everyone, I have found that it has made me feel more stressed because of financial worries, as my husband has now been furloughed. 
It has also increased my anxiety when I have to go food shopping because I know the queues will be horrendous, I am also worried about being able to buy food, especially when people were panic buying. 
It has also made me feel very sad that I am not allowed to go & see my parents who have underlying health conditions. It also makes me sad that I am not allowed to see my sister or Nephews.
