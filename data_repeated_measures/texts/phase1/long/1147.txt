I’m extremely worried about what is to come. Especially as I have just heard the news the Priminister is In intensive care. It’s so scary as it could literally happen to anyone. I have a husband and children so am also worried about them. I fear them getting the virus but I’m also worried about money as my husband is unable to work. It’s a very stressful time for everyone. At this moment in time I am sad, worried, anxious and scared. I feel I cannot escape it as I work for the local government and they are putting a lot of measures into place and it makes it very real. I am worried about leaving the house even just for food. I’m frightened for my husband as he has asthma and my son who has a low immune system. I am trying to avoid reading too much about it during the day as it really is making me feel a bit depressed which is something I have never experienced in such a big way like this before.
