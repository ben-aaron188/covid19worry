Not overly bothered by the current situation - but I did a biology degree and now work in public health so I'm possibly a bit more clued up than the average person I.e. not so susceptible to media scare-mongering.
My parents are both 65 so I'm aware they're slightly more at risk than I am, but they're both relatively healthy so I'm not particularly concerned. 
What I find most disturbing is the media coverage that misrepresents and misinforms the public - a pandemic is worrying enough without the newspapers reporting every single death it can find.
