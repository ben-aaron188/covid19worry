I am not worried at all and I believe that even if I do catch it I will recover swiftly. I am also not that worried about my family catching it because they take a lot of precautions regularly and are following government guidelines. I also don't believe that anybody in my family is at risk of dying from coronavirus.

I am feeling pretty relaxed right now and nothing is affecting me. I am in good spirits and good health. I am not feeling down, and I am perfectly fine in financial terms as well. This also applies to my family who are paying bills as usual.
