I feel that it is fear that is what people are scared of, the BBC plays fear into houses all day. The virus is serious for certain demographics, not everyone and most should still be at work, kids at school. Governments were scared! We are had to need the NHS to believe that the money we are taxed for it is good value.  It is a political virus and with low education in the subject, people can only take the view they are given! Coronavirus is a means to control people where none was needed, the debts caused will frustrate the next generation's ambitions.
