As well as the immediate health threat, scared of the long term impact on society, jobs, economy, relationships, education.

This is so big I can't think about the whole thing, I can just manage one but at a time. So little I can control or influence.

Feel guilty that I am better off than most people in that my job is relatively secure and I can work from home.

It doesn't seem real a lot if the time. Right now have finished work, am watching TV with my family and contemplating making dinner, so pretty normal. But nothing is normal or the same and it's actually quite scary.
