I am very worried about the corona situation as I have an underlying health condition putting me at risk. I also haven't left the house in over 2 weeks now, and struggling to get a grocery shopping slot, and am worrying how I am going to get my groceries as I don't drive nor have anyone to help, so it is scary. I also do not like the uncertainty of the situation, as no one knows when we will be out of lockdown nor when we will be back at school, as I am doing a placement in a school and I was near the end of my course, so I may not even be going back to the school, which sucks.
