Generally I am very scared about catching the virus and becoming seriously ill and requiring hospitalisation.  I have previously had pneumonia so the thought of a similar and potentially worse experience is extremely frightening.  I also have two children who I am concerned about the effect on their lives of the restrictions and the lack of certainty over the potential longterm outcome.  I am also stressed by working from home and simultaneously supervising my children so I would prefer to have the stress of working removed so that I can concentrate on just getting through it.
