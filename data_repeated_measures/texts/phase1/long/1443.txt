I'm feeling very anxious about the number of deaths and my perceived inability to prevent myself catching Coronavirus. I am staying at home with my family, have kept deliveries to food and essentials and have only left the house to deliver food to my parents and my mother-in-law, who are both on the extremely vulnerable list. 

I have been very angry in recent days at people who have been ignoring the social distancing rules - specifically my neighbour who had a small gathering (of at least three different households) in her garden at the weekend. It makes me very sad that some people have such disregard for others' health and safety.
