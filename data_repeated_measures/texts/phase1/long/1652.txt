Mostly feeling fed up.  Not being able to go to work and not sure if there will be work after it. 
My partner was showing all signs of the virus so we self-isolated before being told. I never had any symptoms at all. So now, we're thinking did she have it or not. Testing shouldn't be so hard to sort out.
I do think now the knock-on effect will be that funding for research might be pushed to the forefront now its affected the rich and the trade in wildlife be frowned upon.  Feeling ill not being able to go out for exercise.
