I’m feeling cautious but as I’m self isolating so feel that I’m doing all I can to prevent contracting or carrying the virus. I feel anxious when I watch the news and see the number of deaths but I remind myself I don’t live in a city and  compared to other places our death toll is low. I am interested in how the virus is spreading more than I feel anxious. I try not to watch the news all the time but once or twice a day is enough because I understand how it could make people anxious and afraid. I’m not bored by self isolation but some people are so I think we need to remain cautious and not become complacent.
