I worry about my parents who are both over 75. I live with them and I worry that I could pick up the virus and pass it on to them, and that ultimately I may be the cause of their deaths. At the same time I have to do everything that they would otherwise do outside of the home. It's a weight on me and I feel it everyday, even for simple things like taking out the bins or doing shopping. I also don't see this ending anytime particularly soon, and I worry about the effect it will have on my own mental health.
