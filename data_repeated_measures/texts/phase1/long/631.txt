Fearful and anxious.
Nervous stomach and racing thoughts.
Worry for the world and what it will become.
Scared for my family and my friends.
Sad for the elderly and those who are totally alone.
Sick of trying to get food into the house!
Feels like a survival game or a science fiction novel.
Unable to concentrate on anything for me than a couple of minutes - brain like a moth around a light.
Cross with people who are flouting the rules.
Worry that this is a virus we know nothing about and so can't possibly know the outcome 6 months, a year or even 2 years down the track.
Every time I go shopping I see germs and fear other people - I see the fear in them too.
Want to wak up and it has all gone away
