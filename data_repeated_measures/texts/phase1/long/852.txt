I'm feeling quite calm as I don't tend to venture out much anyway, I'm not a very sociable person.  I'm relaxed as there is very little traffic which means there is a general air of calm and we're seeing more of nature coming to the fore.  If I'm honest, I'll be sorry when somethings go back to 'normal'.  The only time I feel anything other than calm is reading certain posts on social media but I can walk away from that and go back to my 'bubble'.  I feel that the situation may be tightened up due to people not taking things seriously, or even that it may be prolonged.  As it is at the moment, this isn't causing us major problems.  It's probably the only time I haven't worried about us both being unemployed
