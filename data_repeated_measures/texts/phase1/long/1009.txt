I'm sick of staying inside, I'm sick of not being able to do what I want and go where I want. I dislike my job and I was in the process of applying for new jobs but obviously I'm stuck with what I've got now and working from home and I hate it. There's nothing really to take my mind off it other than exercise and it's grim being stuck indoors all day with people that I'd rather not be stuck with constantly to be honest. There's only so many times in a day I can go for a run and then lift weights to try and free my mind without it creeping back onto the current situation
