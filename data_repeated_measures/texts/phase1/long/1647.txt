I think it’s very serious. I think we need to take precaution. I think it is dangers to older generation. I am worried for my family member. Especially the older generation in my family that have a medical situation as I know they are in a very dangerous situation if they catch the coronavirus. I’m very scared for them however I am not scared for myself as I know my immune system is fine and I am young. Although I am very scared for my sister as her immune system is beyond terrible from the amount of stuff she eats. However from her age I don’t believe she as at too much risk even though she also has asthma.
