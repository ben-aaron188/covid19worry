I feel quite philosophical about it. We have a member of our family who is very vulnerable health-wise, but we're used to being on that rollercoaster as a family, so perhaps we have a bit more perspective than other people. 
It has made work quite difficult - I work in a department that requires very fast turn around communication and also a lot of very hi-tech hardware, so this has all been a bit of a nightmare to get set up. We're getting there though with a good team and some very dark humour.
