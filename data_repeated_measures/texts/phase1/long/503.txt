I am feeling very angry at the situation as people donâ€™t realise how bad it can be and still have the thought that this is all fake!!!
If we go into total lockdown then I believe that there would be rioting on the streets as people are stupid enough to believe that this is against their human rights and think that they have the right to do anything they want 
It also annoys that parents either have no control/or interest in their children and are allowing them to go out and meet in gangs
Also the scams that are currently going on is disgusting and these people need to be shot they are preying on peoples anxiety and conning people out of monies
