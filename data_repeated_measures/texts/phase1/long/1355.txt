Frustrated at how it is limiting my life opportunities and that of my children.  Anxious that my family may catch it and become ill.  Worried about the financial impact on myself, family and friends.  Without an end date it is hard to keep motivated.  I don't know how well it is being handled.  Some people seem to be taking opportunities to make money or claim 'glory' when they're not really helping the cause.  Others flout the rules without concern whilst my family are caused sadness by the restrictions.
