i am currently furloughed, so a little anxious of the situation with work, and when that will re-start. I Am trying to busy myself with jobs around the house to keep the worst of the anxiety at bay, and trying to turn the situation into a feeling of positivity. This has been fairly successful for now, but who knows how long this will go on for. I guess I feel a little guilty not being at work when others are. I  Feel for those directly affected with the virus and who have lost loved ones or those close to them. Very sad situation
