I feel quite anxious and worried due to reading how so many people with no health conditions are dying.
I am more worried about a family member getting the virus as opposed to myself.
I do feel angry at the point that people are not helping themselves and other people by constantly being out and about in parks and large groups and not keeping the distance.
I am very concerned about how the encomy will be able to recover from this due to so many shops closing and people losing their jobs which will cause such a major impact and will be so much worse than the 2008 recession.
