I am worried and so very anxious. I worry about my own health as well as the health of my loved ones. I worry about the economy, both UK and global. I'm scared that my house move will fall through, it matters so much that we move soon, but I also feel guilt that I'm so upset about a house move when people are dying. I worry about my career, I'm on a fixed term contract in academia - what will happen to me now? Will there be a job for me next year? Will my husband still have a job? Maybe we shouldn't move house after all... Mostly I'm just afraid. All the time.
