I feel a bit anxious about the Coronavirus situation because I'm worried about older members of the family such as my mother who is nearly 90.  I'm happy about the lock down to reduce the likelihood of infection.  I don't think it is too much of a hassle if it works.  I have been a bit obsessive with the news - I've even watched the Orange Oaf's update from the USA on the BBC website when he shows what a ghastly human being he is. I do get irritated with stories of people visiting the beach, etc. on the weekends.
