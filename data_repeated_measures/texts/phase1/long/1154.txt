While I myself am not that worried about corona virus in general, I can't deny that I am feeling the strain caused by the outbreak existing. By this I mean that my country is currently in lockdown and the stress and anxiety of my household in turn gets absorbed by me as well. I find myself worrying for the mental and emotional state of my loved ones during these hard times. I can say with certainty that not everyone is handling the lockdown well and being stuck at home for long periods of time just makes everyone anxious and stressed. I believe the world will manage to beat this outbreak soon, as long as people cooperate.
