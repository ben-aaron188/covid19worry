I am angry and disgusted about people who don’t adhere to the rules and don’t seem to care. I’m fearful about my mum who has to work on the frontline as a medical professional (I would rather she was at home). Everything makes me feel more anxious than usual, in particular the sound of emergency service sirens makes me very uncomfortable and I don’t know why. I’m still working (from home) but struggling to focus. Sadness is high for me, mainly in the economic side, I keep worrying how many suicides coronavirus will cause due to economic impact and it makes me very sad, also who gives spare change now to the homeless? That is very sad I think
