I currently feel sad about not being able to see my mum. I go shopping for her but I can’t go in or kiss her goodbye. That is upsetting. I’m also becoming anxious which brings on funny symptoms such as pains, headaches etc which in turn makes the anxiety worse. I know this will pass. One thing I do like is how quiet it is, the birds singing, the air is clearer and nature has started to take over in places just from a few weeks of being left untouched. I know this will all come right in the end but I reckon everyone will be a lot different and also the planet. It has to be.
