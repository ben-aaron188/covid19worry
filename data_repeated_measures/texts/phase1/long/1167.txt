I feel anxious, worried, stressed, and sad at the current situation.  Also some anger at those still going out in big groups etc. and putting others at risk.  I miss seeing my family and friends, and even miss the ugly office I usually work in!
It was my birthday yesterday which I think has been / will be the hardest day, as it would usually be spent with friends and family, and all the plans I'd made got cancelled.  Still, a lockdown is for the best if it means this is over sooner and more safely.
