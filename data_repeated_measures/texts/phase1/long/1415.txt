To be honest i am a little bit worried about the whole situation as i have 2 young kids who I worry about daily don’t want none of this to affect them. Makes me question the world I brought them into. I also worry for my family and loved ones and wondering if they are ok and following the precautions. But i am staying in doors and communicating with family and friends and checking up on everyone that I know via social media. I am a very care free person in general and try not to make things bother me so I’m trying to not let it get to me and just follow what MR JOHNSON has has stated regarding lock down procedures.
