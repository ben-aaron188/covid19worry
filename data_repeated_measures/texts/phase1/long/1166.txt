The whole Corona virus situation is really deadly and scary. It is also depressing because of the self-isolation, social distancing and limited time to go out of your house. We must not blame China or Chinese people, it's a natural pandemic and we cannot avoid that. We must not also blame the government for it's spreading. It will not spread if we we follow instruction which we are given to us. Also, to keep good hand washing and good hygiene. In my opinion, God or just the earth itself is testing us humans. It's like a silent war. I hope it will be over soon and 2020 will be fine foe the rest of the year.
