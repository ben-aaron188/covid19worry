I feel a bit overwhelmed as I am just watching the news come in about the death toll but for the most  part right now I feel relaxed and reassured about the situation. I do feel some frustration because I cant go and do what I'd normally do but I'm happy to be healthy and with my family who are also healthy. Also happy because I've had a productive day despite the circumstances. my feelings fluctuate a lot but in this current moment I feel happy and reassured but a little bit cooped up because the weather is so nice and I cant go and sit on the beach. But I'm happy to stay inside if it keeps me safe and others safe
