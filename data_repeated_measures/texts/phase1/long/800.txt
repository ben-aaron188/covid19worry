I am able to work from home at the moment, so I'm feeling very lucky in that sense. I am however worried for all the key workers who have to potentially come in contact with the virus daily. I am trying to stay positive in this situation and hope for the best. If everyone follows the government guidelines, we should be able to beat this virus. All we have to do is stay home and be considerate of others. I cannot wait for this pandemic to be over. More than ever, I want everyone to get back to their normal lives. I think the whole coronavirus situation is a good wake up call for everyone to not take things for granted and be grateful for every day that we get to live.
