I am concerned for the vulnerable people in my family and local community and about how long it will last. I am proud and happy about the sefless work that many people have put into keeping people safe. I am anxious about the affect social distancing will have on people and that isolation will cause alot of sadness, Not being able to go out is putting stress on me and my partner as we do not have a lot of space so we are getting on each others nerves more than normal. this is a few sentences I dont now what else you want?
