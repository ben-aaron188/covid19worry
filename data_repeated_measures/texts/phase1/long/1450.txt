I am wishing for the situation to be over soon but I am worried about the potential for it to carry on for a lot longer. I have not caught the coronavirus or known anyone to have caught it, so my worries are relatively small. It brings me hope to see people banding together since we are all in the same situation, however I feel sorry for everyone who is suffering. I am grateful to everyone working to combat the virus and those providing essential services during these times. I hope the world will recover quickly.
