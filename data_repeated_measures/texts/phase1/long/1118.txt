I am worried about my friends and family in lockdown in Spain. My mum keeps working as she is an essential worker and I'm worried she is going to catch the virus and pass it to my dad. 

One of my best friends was hospitalised last week due to Covid-19 so I have also been very worried for her. 

I also worry about whether our jobs will survive this crisis.

Apart from that I love being at home and being with my kids so I am really enjoying the lockdown in that way. We don't miss going out. We have a lovely garden so we spend a lot of time gardening and sunbathing if the weather is nice.
