At this very moment, I am feeling very fearful and sad about the Corona situation. I am afraid of contracting the virus and fear for my health and the health of my family. I am also very worried and anxious about the financial impact the situation will cause now and in the future. I'm feeling sad about the loss of life and about life coming to a standstill. I miss my family and friends keeping in touch by text and video call just isn't the same, I'm upset that I can't give them a hug. I also feel very helpless as I can't really do much to help anyone or the situation.
