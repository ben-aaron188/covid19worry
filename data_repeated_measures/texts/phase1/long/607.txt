I am relaxed about the situation as itâ€™s not as big a problem in our area as it is in the cities. I am a little anxious about my place of business as I work for a small family run company. I am enjoying the extra family time as we would not normally have as much time together due to work, school and nursery. I am a little worried about my parents contracting the virus as my father has asthma and COPD. I am a little angry at the people who are not listening to the guidelines and doing as they please.
