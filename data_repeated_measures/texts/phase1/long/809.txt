I am worried about the current rate of virus spread. I worry that my family are not safe and worry for my elderly family whom I am unable to see.  I am sad at not being able to see my family who live over 50 miles away therefore not essential travel. I worry that my childrens education will be severely affected by the closure of schools. I am frustrated that people are not adhering to the social distancing rules put in place by the government. I am frustrated by medical. Professionals who are not following isolation precautions.
