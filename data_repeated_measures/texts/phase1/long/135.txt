I feel concerned for my familyâ€™s and friends health and for my health. I am worried about one of us contracting the virus as it does not discriminate and people of all ages are dying. I also feel angry and frustrated that people are defying the Government guidelines and not social distancing. Also found some people to be incredibly selfish as well as people who have been extremely kind to others.  I am an admin worker for the NH and am busy working long hours from home so feel proud that I can contribute to the fight against COVID.
