Im worried i may have underlying issues that may come to light if get corona. 
I am concerned about my diet and lifestyle without being as active as normal.  
I am concerned about my mental health not seeing everyone. 
I am concerned about my husband and his vulnerability.  I have massive anxiety about shopping but not about stock piling but not being able to get what i need. I am struggling with my routine being out of sync. It is effecting my sleep and wearing me down which in turn i worry will go against me when i get the virus.
