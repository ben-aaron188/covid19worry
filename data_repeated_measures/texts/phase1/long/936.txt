I feel useless and. Unable to contribute in a meaningful way. The fear of the unknown is making me anxious about what things will be like when corona virus is over. I'm certain there will be economic backlash for years to come. I fear for my family, friends and neighbours and although I'm. In a god steady job I am. Worried this could change in the future. 
I worry that people do not take the impositions made by government seriously and will cause this to be a prolonged problem for the United Kingdom and the wider world.
