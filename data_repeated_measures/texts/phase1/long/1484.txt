I feel like we are approaching the peak of the virus. I am usually a worrier and experience much anxiety on a daily basis. However, in the last few weeks my mental health has improved massively. I do not see the point in worrying about this - I am doing all I can to keep myself and my family safe and feel confident that other family members and friends are doing likewise. This knowledge relaxes me.

My sleep has been mildly disrupted but I presume this is due to my daily routine being less active. I am happy to have lost weight due to takeaways being closed. I allow myself to look at the news once a day. I feel sad for those who have lost their life. Then I move on and do something else.
