I have realised the complexity of the situation we are in. I am in a high risk health group and was in hospital A & E last year on a nebuliser because of my asthma. I am very fearful of how the virus would affect me were I to catch it. I am too scared to go into supermarkets but can't get a delivery slot so sourcing food from small local businesses is difficult and expensive. I feel that once restrictions are eased infections and deaths will continue over a prolonged period of time and as such I feel that there will be a serious risk to my health for the foreseeable future. As a lone parent of a young son who has autism this is extremely worrying.  I still don't think the majority of people appreciate how lengthy this battle is going to be.
