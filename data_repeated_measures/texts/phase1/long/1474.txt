The situation with coronavirus at the moment is rather worrying. The amount of cases and deaths is raising rapidly. The fact it came from Chinaâ€™s wet markets, and they have now reopened those wet markets disgusts me. They should learn from their mistakes! I am proud of Britain coping the way it is. I am angry at the selfish people though, who continue to go out and enjoy the sunshine. My partner is classed as a key worker and I am worried that he will come into contact with someone with the virus and that he will get ill.
I hope Britain can get over it quickly and the country can get back on its feet.
