i am feeling scared and anxious about what this holds for the country and economy. i am concerned for my family's finances and health. I am worried about how long and how grave this will be for the world. I am trying to avoid the news, it can easily become overwhelming. i am trying to distract myself and appreciate what I have. I also am trying to help those who have less than me, like vulnerable neighbours. I also ring family members, if i don't  hear from them I am more worried than I normally would be.
