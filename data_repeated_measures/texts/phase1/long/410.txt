I have just read about the UK deaths for today, so I'm feeling quite sad. At the same time I'm feeling frustration that people in the UK aren't taking social distancing seriously and going out for picnics and gatherings despite the spread. I miss my mum too as I'm unable to see her, due to her being high risk and living an hour away. I feel lucky that I have my partner to see over self isolation, so feel very grateful that I have him. Overall I'm feeling quite sad about the situation, not to mention worried financially as I'm self employed and currently out of work.
