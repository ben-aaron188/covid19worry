It is a very scary time for everyone, I have an elderly grandma and a young baby I have to shop for. It is scary going out but at the same time I also need to. I think lock down needs to be harder and stop exercise while ever we are allowing people to walk in parks they will flock on nice days, with friends from other house holds. It angers me when I see people in groups you know are not from the same household. It is very worrying but it will get better in time. We all just need to focus very hard on supporting the nhs and staying at home!
