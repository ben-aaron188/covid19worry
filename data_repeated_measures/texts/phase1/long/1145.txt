I feel worried about the effect Corona will have on the economy and also anxious about any of my loved ones getting this virus. I also feel unsettled as this is such an uncertain time. We do not know how long lockdown will need to last. This open ended situation makes me feel extremely anxious and nervous for the future. I feel happy and thankful to have had no symptoms, nor any of my loved ones have had them. I am also worried because I have no current income. Relying on universal credit will be something I will find hard to do. Not being able to work is having an effect on my routine and Iâ€™m therefore sleeping differently to my usual sleep pattern.
