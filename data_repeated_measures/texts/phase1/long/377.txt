I am annoyed at those ignoring recommendations therefore potentially making isolation longer for everyone else. I am sad that I can't see close friends and family. I am finding the isolation difficult, spending so much time in an enclosed space and also feeling stressed out by who I am living with. I have found a lack of privacy and feel like I will eventually 'crack up' and lose my cool with people. I also find it difficult to complete my job at home with a lack of equipment and privacy again.
