I feel very scared of how everything has turned out with the world regarding corona virus (covid-19) and I am worried incase family members catch It, especially those who have underlying health issues. I'm worried incase things don't go back to normal, I'm scared incase the world goes into lockdown for months or even years. I'm shocked at the number of deaths in the UK and then again around the whole world. Although I am happy that I am at my family home and I am able to quarantine with them instead of being all alone 60 miles away from my parents and siblings
