I feel fearful when a family member has to leave the house to go shopping as they could come into contact with someone with coronavirus without knowing as the person might not have symptoms at the time. I'm worried a member of my family might get coronavirus and might have to go to hospital. 
I also feel sad that I can't see family members that aren't living with me, but I am following the rules and only going out when necessary (for shopping- as little as possible) as I understand how serious and important it is.
