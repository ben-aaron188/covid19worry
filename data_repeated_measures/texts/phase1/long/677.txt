I feel very anxious about the situation, due to the uncertainty of the extent of it. I feel we won’t know the full extent until people abide by the lockdown rules, so I am fearful of the full effects on the most vulnerable! It’s hard to comprehend but also it’s easy to stay inside unless essential, in order to help reduce the pressure On the NHS and reduce the spread. It’s very hard not seeing family and friends, especially as it’s unknown how long we won’t see them for! The corona situation is showing how strong we are but also that we need to help others around us!
