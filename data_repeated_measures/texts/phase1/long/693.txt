I would not usually be at home during the day as it negatively affects my mood. My house is small and I have young children. It is difficult to keep them entertained in one room all day. I went to town for the first time on Sunday to buy cat food and found it very scary. There seemed to be more people with mental issues in the streets and much fewer other people to ask for help if there were problems. Most of the shops are shut and there’s no access to public toilets. People who are out do not respect the 2m rule and others and abuse the staff who are trying to enforce them. I am scared to go into town where usually we would spend most of the day there before. When I got home my anxiety and fear was so bad I felt I couldn’t breathe or think and I don’t usually suffer with anxiety. Now we go for exercise before 6am because we don’t trust people and if we have to shop we try to be home by 8:30am and we go to local shops and not the supermarkets. The queuing system is terrifying and full of people coughing and smoking and grouching about the stupid rules. I do not want to queue to potentially catch something that kills me or my family. Shops say one family member only and forget that we can’t leave our children outside alone, and that to buy a weeks shopping is often not possible. We have four cats, three children and no car. The cat food weighs 10kg for a week. The litter weighs 3kg. Milk for all of us is 30litres. I’m pushing a double buggy with 20kg of children in already, how do I carry everything? We can’t get home delivery, there are no slots and we’re not vulnerable. Shopping every second day is the least we can get away with at the moment. That means we have a higher chance of meeting the virus.
