I feel very frustrated at some individuals who are not sticking to the rules. I am anxious that they are going to make the process longer and worse. I feel isolated as I am a single parent and also very worried as I can’t visit my dad who is dying of cancer. I feel sad that I may not see him alive again. This turns to anger when I think about the people not doing as their told again because I’m sure if they were in my situation they would be wanting this over with as soon as possible. The public appear to be very selfish and this has shocked me as I thought everyone would pull together
