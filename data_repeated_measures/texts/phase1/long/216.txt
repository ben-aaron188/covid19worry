at the moment i am very afraid for my own health and my families help.i am very worried about my job and my financial position. i am sad and a bit depressed at all the bad news published on social media and television just hope we dont get the virus.my childrens education is in crisis the economy is in crisis the nhs is in crisis and the social distancing laws are making us less connected.no one is safe and the atmosphere is one of anxiety and uncertainty .the future is very uncertain and we wonder how long this crisis will last and how the world will be when the crisis is finally over
