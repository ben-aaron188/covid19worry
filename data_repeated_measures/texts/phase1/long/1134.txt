I am a bit lonely and a bit frustrated at not being able to see anyone but mostly I am sad I guess and anxious. It is my son's 8th Birthday tomorrow and he can't have a party and most of his presents haven't turned up yet.
Went out today for an emergency shop of what we could find to tide him over - just hope he has a good day.
Tired though, just blown up 75 balloons!!
So all in all a real mixture of feelings, I hope he has a good day and I hope everyone gets better soon. It must be hard for all the people on the front line or are suffering financially
