I'm currently very afraid for my parents, scared for my family and to a degree myself (I have a health condition that could complicate any infection or recovery from it). I have risk because I have to go to the supermarket, I have to shop for my parents. It's stressful. Im thankful for bonus time with my children though. So much of our lives is rushed  and we live it tired, but we finally have a chance to rest and enjoy quality time together in a way that feels almost unique, with work limited and more free time than I can ever remember having.
