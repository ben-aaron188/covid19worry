The weight of the anxiety I feel is so intense it makes me wonder if I'm symptomatic - the tightness of chest could be illness or simply suppressed fear. I worry in case I die and leave my daughter alone. I worry I won't keep my job. I worry this is the beginning of the end for us all as the climate changes. I wish I knew if I had it/had had it. And I also hope that this could be the last chance to turn things round for the planet, a chance I didn't think we'd get. I love to see the wildlife creeping back into the world. And I hope the government bail the right people out.
