I am a bit worried because the Government acted so late but also think it will be ok if everyone follows the new rules and stays inside. I am worried about my financial situation because all of the pubs/clubs are shut and I am a student and most of us work in those places. I hope it doesn't last too long and we lose all of the summer. It has meant my masters experiments have been cancelled so I may not graduate. That is annoying and I can't afford to extend my studies. Overall, I am feeling anxious about the situation.
