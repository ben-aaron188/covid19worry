I feel tired and withdrawn and like this will never end. Im anxious about mine and my families health and the economy and how we will recover. Im not sure if this part of the survey is flawed as i originally wrote a really long piece and it wouldnt accept it even though it was more than 500 characters. But little things like that seem to irritate me more than usual. I feel annoyed and sad as well as worried my ocd will go through the roof when the restrictions are relaxed. My cousin and aunt work as nurses in a badly hit hospital so i am concerned for them and my elderly grandma they visit to give shopping to.  I am hating being cooped up with my partner who im arguing with more than usual as he is snapping and being horrible more than usual which stresses me out as usually i am very laid back. In my head i want to break lockdown and just travel to my family but i never would and i feel powerless and useless to help other people.
