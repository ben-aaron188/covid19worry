I am generally anxious as it is, but currently this primarily relates to losing loved ones who are vulnerable, and huge suffering globally. I ruminate a lot on elderly/sick people potentially being on their own with no help, my family being in another country where i am unable to be of assistance and so on. I have a little anxiety with regards to my own health, but as i am young and relatively healthy, and being cautious, i think i stand a reasonable chance. I feel angry when people do not take the necessary steps to prevent the problem - what we are being asked is not difficult, and i struggle with the daily moaning about how awful it is, i think we are very fortunate and could really do what is being asked very easily (for the most part) and without much difficulty.
