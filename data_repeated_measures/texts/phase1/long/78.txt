I'm making sure that I remain relaxed, as I don't want to cause myself any stress. This doesn't mean I'm not taking it seriously. I am following all guidelines required of me, as it's important that I avoid contracting covid-19 with me helping care for my grandmother, who is 100.
I do feel a little angry, as I believe the UK government took too long in laying down regulations. I also feel they are not doing enough to protect our NHS.
I'm disappointed that a small minority of the general public keep flouting the rules and feel more needs to be done about it.
