It's very frustrating and when I think of how long we all have to stay apart I get annoyed. Also the fact that you can't physically go shopping, or get a Mcdonalds or anything is annoying. All because China can't be trusted. They've done it many times before creating pandemics, and they're pretty much the only country that has. You wouldn't see huge flu pandemics originating in the United Kingdom! There should be laws placed on the things they do in that country. 

However at this precise moment I am trying not to think about it too much so I'm fairly relaxed. I don't really watch the news, go on Facebook etc because it's all people can talk about and I've had enough of seeing it.
