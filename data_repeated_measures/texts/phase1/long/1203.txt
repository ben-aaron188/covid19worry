I feel more anger than fear due to the fact that people aren't conforming to the rules and instead are not realising the seriousness of the issue at hand. However, it still remains a very scary time knowing that the situation is out of most people hands and the people who have power did not use it quick enough and have instead left the situation to escalate further and further leading to more deaths. Another fear of mine is how long it will take for life to return to normal after the pandemic as many people will continue to excercising social distancing after the lockdown rules have been eased, the uncertainity of the situtation makes it a lot more scary.
