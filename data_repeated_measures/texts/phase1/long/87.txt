I am worried more than anxious. There have been so many inconsistant information thats it difficult to know who to believe. I am concerned about the financial implications just as much as the virus itself.I am worried  about my child and how he will cope. I feel tired due to mixed sleep paterns and like others totally confused as to what day it actually is. I sometimes feel alone and miss the contact of family and friends. I don't want to celebrate when this ends and just want life to go back to some normality.
