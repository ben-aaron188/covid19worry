I feel fearful. Not really for myself as I feel I may have already had a mild version of the virus. I feel fearful for family members who are more vulnerable to the virus than me. I feel anger at the approach and lack of preparation of the UK government but not surprise as they seemed incompetent and lacking in empathy before the virus. I also feel sadness for the students I teach who have had so much taken away from them especially those who had been working hard and preparing for exams, especially as they didn't even get to say goodbye to their friends. I also feel anxious for my son who is missing his friends at pre-school and will have to go straight to primary school without being prepared for it.
