I feel anxious about what is to come and how we can get back to normality.
I wish everybody would follow the rules.
I feel sad and angry as I cannot see my 2 year old son as his mother has flouted the rules by visiting and moving in with her mother 2 weeks after lockdown. 
Hopeful it can bring country together and grateful for our wonderful people in the nhs.
Exercise has been massively important to my physical and mental health and the whole situation will be exponentially worse if we were not permitted to have daily exercise.
