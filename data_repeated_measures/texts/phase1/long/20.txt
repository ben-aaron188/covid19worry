I feel incredibly hopeless. As a single person who is around an age when they really should be finding someone, it feels like wasted time. People who are in relationships and married at least have someone they can confide in during this situation. 

I wake up with a sense of resignation, knowing that I won't see anyone or do anything interesting. One of the only good things is that I can work from home and for me this is so much better. I don't have to worry about commuting, so I don't waste that extra time and money. I can now focus on hobbies such as learning languages.
