Right now I am feeling panicked. Alot of people from my area seem to be getting ill. In the last five minutes I've also heard about the prime minister which has made me even more nervous. I am not worried for myself but my children and my family. I worry I have not taken it serious enough. Even though I have followed all guidelines however I have recently got paint from non contact delivery. I don't want to get ill or my family too. I'm feeling very overwhelmed. It makes.me want to cry to release my emotions.
