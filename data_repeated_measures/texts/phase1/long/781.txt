I'm frustrated at the people that haven't been listening to the government guidelines and are still going out socialising with their friends. because it means this is going to take even longer to get sorted meaning we will have to isolate for longer. I am also missing my family and friends because I can't see them. I'm Getting bored from having to stay at home and upset because it means I potentially have to cancel my holiday, that was booked almost a year ago. And other events I have planned for the summer will most likely have to be cancelled. There's aot of uncertainty about when everything is going to go back to normal that is the worst part
