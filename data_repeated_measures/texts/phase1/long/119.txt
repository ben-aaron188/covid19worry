I feel sad because I am in the last six months of my doctorate and I was hoping for a nice ending, which hasn't happened. I'm currently living at my parents' house and this is causing frustration as we are indoors all the time and are more often ""getting at each other's throats"". I feel angry at those who aren't self isolating or socially distancing, as they are going to make us all have to stay indoors for longer, which is not what I want as I want to be able to get on with my life, my education and my job.
