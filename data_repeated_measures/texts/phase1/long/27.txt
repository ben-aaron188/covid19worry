I am anxious as to how the symptoms would present for myself, my friends and family as no one really knows the level of severity you would experience until you get it. I am relieved there has been a drop in deaths today however there are many more days to come and we must not be complacent. I worry about my husband who still has to go out to work. I am angry at those people who choose not to follow social distancing instructions. I am happy myself and my children and wider family are currently safe.
