I find it quite stressful and although I sleep and function normally it's at the back of my mind constantly. What worries me most is the financial aspect of it. Every time I read the paper and look at the latest numbers i feel sad and worried about the health of my family. In a weird way I also find it fascinating - the impact of the virus on the world is really though provoking and I often find myself thinking 'I wonder what will change after...' I really hope there is some silver lining somewhere.
