I am not particularly worried about the coronavirus situation as my daily life before quarantine consisted of staying at home, so I am unaffected. I am, however, disappointed in the reluctance shown by people in power to lock down their respective countries in order to slow the spread of the virus. I am also rather disgusted by the young people who think it is okay to go outside, catch the virus, and give it to their grandparents or other older people. Irresponsible people, such as those who ""jokingly"" cough in elderly persons' faces, also give me feelings of disgust.
