I feel very scared that I get it, I am scared to go out for essentials and I worry about my family. This is such a disaster for everybody and will change our lives forever. I have previously had breast cancer so I am worried about my immune system been weaker. I feel so sad for all the lives that have been lost already and dread to even think about what the next few weeks will bring us. Lessons need to be learnt from this, and we need to be prepared if anything like this ever happens again. I just want my life to go back to normal and do normal things like before, things that we take for granted.
