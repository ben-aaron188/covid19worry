The Coronavirus situation at the moment is about to peak and reach the worst period in the UK so I think for the moment we are okay if we keep following guidelines. Me personally, I am not too worried as I do not have contact with anyone except for people in my family so I think I should hopefully remain healthy during this period. I am feeling quite relaxed staying at home and doing very little as it is a nice period to catch up with things that I've missed out on from leading a busy life. I am not too anxious for the future and certainly not that angry except I wish that I could go outside and meet people instead of video calling them.
