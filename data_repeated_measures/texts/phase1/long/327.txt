I am feeling a bit scared about the whole situation because of how much it feels like our lives have currently changed. I am also very sad at the number of people suffering and dying due to the coronavirus. It is sad to see the huge numbers of people suffering and dying around the world. I also feel angry at the people who are not following the governments guidelines of staying at home to help save lives and not following the social distancing guidelines. Therefore I have mixed feelings about the current Corona situation.
