At the moment I would say i have a level of anxiety and fear as I am a key worker. Anxious about going to work and possibly catching the virus and fearful i may pass it on if caught to family members. I wish people generally would take the situaton more seriously and follow the government guidelines. On my travels to work i see numerous people out and about, far too many to make the environment safe for everybody.  The situation in supermarkets is somewhat better than in recent weeks, however deliveries are very scarce and understandably for vulnerable people only. However this means that more people who are not classed as vulnerable are descending on supermarkets which is not ideal and i have seen numerous queues to get in, where people are not practising social distancing.
