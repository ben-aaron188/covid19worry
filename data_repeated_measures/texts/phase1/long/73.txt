I feel quite anxious about my family and not wanting any of them to catch it.
I also feel uncertainty with regards to how long we will be in lock down for and what it will mean for the economy when this is all over.
I am enjoying spending more time with my family but i worry about my sons schooling because i don't want him to fall behind.
I am also anxious because we don't know how long it will be until we get a vaccination for Corona or how effective it will be.
I am also worried and anxious about money and if we will be alright in the future
