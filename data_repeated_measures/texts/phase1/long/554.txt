My feelings about corona is mixed. I feel anxious for my family and friends especially my parents who are at high risk. Also my work colleges who are looking after the children of keyworkers. I am angry when I watch the TV and see scenes of people gathering in groups as theses are the people who will cause this to never go away and we want life to get back to normal  the government is trying to do their best in a difficult situation and the minority of the public are not heeding the advice given. I have even seen in the supermarkets people not following the rules that they have in place to keep us safe,
