I am feeling upset and anxious for people who are directly affected by Coronavirus, especially those who are very ill. Personally, I do not know anyone who is ill, but my parents are both key workers so I am worried about them. However, I also feel relaxed and I now have more time to complete uni work. I am trying to see as many positives in this situation as possible. I am concerned about the effect this will all have on the economy and my personal money situation as I have been furloughed, but many people have it worse than I do.
