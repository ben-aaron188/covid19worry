I am anxious about the way the situation is developing as well as the open ended nature of it. As someone who lives on their own the past few weeks have been quite isolating. The constant fear of the rumours about having the ability to exercise outdoors once a day taken away from us also cause me lots of worry as this is the only thing getting me through the isolation. Despite regularly talking to friends and family on the phone, this can't replace physically interacting with people. I am also anxious about work and the possibility of being furloughed and being stuck inside all day with no purpose.
