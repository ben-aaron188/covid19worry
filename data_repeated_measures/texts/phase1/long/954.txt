I feel sad that so many people are dying. It’s scary to think that this is happening all over the world. Everyone is affected and in a strange way it’s given everyone a common ground. 
I think most people are listening to the rules set out by their governments but a few are not and these people should be punished.  I wonder how long this will go on for as I have holiday booked that won’t happen ! I know everyone is feeling the same but think people with older relatives must be more worried than others
