i feel apprehensive, anxious, nervous and worried about the current situation. Not for myself but for the older members of my family who may succumb to the virus. Also for my partner who at the moment is working with vulnerable people, she is taking all precautions but nothing is 100% in this world. My heart also goes out to those people working within the NhS AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. The country is pulling together but there are still people who still do not understand how serious the situation is.
