Fearful I may carry and give the virus to my daughter. Frustrated as a key worker I am required to continue working and will no doubt be required to pay more tax to repay the amount being given out at the moment. Fearful that as a key worker along with my wife that I need to put my daughter in nursery so I can go to work while everyone else is able to spend around three months with their families. Frustrated at people who are not adhering to the lockdown terms for there own benefit despite the amount of literacy around telling people to not do this, all this will ultimately lead to lockdown lasting for longer than anticipated.
