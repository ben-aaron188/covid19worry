I'm worried about the health and wellbeing of my family and friends. I'm concerned that this could become more dangerous due to the actions of others. I'm worried about my own personal financial situation and how I will manage to secure employment going forward. I hope that everyone pulls together in order to minimise the impact of this virus while health services try to deal with what is going on. I admire all those key workers who are putting their lives on the line every day to help other people in society.
