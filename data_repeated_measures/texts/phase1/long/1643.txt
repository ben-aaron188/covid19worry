I am very worried. I am a care worker in vulnerable peopleâ€™s homes so therefore this puts me and the service users at greater risk of contracting the disease. I now know of people who have the disease and people who have died from it so now it has become more real and therefore has increased my fear and anxiety. It also makes me angry when I see people congregating in groups when it is clear that this should not be happening. I also feel that not everyone is taking things seriously and taking the necessary precautions to prevent and minimise the spread of the disease. It also angers me that people are buying lots of items in the supermarkets at once as this means those who have to work may not be able to get their necessities when they have finished work
