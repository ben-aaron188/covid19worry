I am currently enforcing the social distancing advice. Going out once per day to exercise. I am not too concerned for myself as I am physically healthy, however it is clear that age is not necessarily a prerequisite. Also, living in rural Devon means cases are low and risk is also low. Generally speaking I am fearful for the economy following the crisis, not much discussion has taken place regarding the billions and trillions of Â£ and $ which has come from somewhere to help us in this scenario.
