At this very moment I’m just tremendously worried about the lasting effects of coronavirus. The deaths it may cause, the damage to the economy and just a general negative lasting effect on society. The NHS is a system we are incredibly lucky to have, and the thought of it suffering due to this is very worrying. I also feel extremely proud of all the key workers, this situation really has brought out the best in some people. On the other hand, a minority of people aren’t staying inside as they should be, and are flouting the rules to enjoy some warm weather. These people make me extremely angry, as there are NHS workers putting their lives on the line every single day, while some people can’t seem to deal with not sunbathing for a few weeks.
