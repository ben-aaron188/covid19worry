I feel anxious (but I have had pre existence no anxiety and panic attacks for a year or so before the lockdown anyway) and this has been heightened with the corona situation. I am mostly worried because I have lost my source of income for the foreseeable future and I’m also anxious I won’t be able to get my medication as easily when it runs out.

However it is nice to have a chance to reset, allow myself to be at home and not feel guilty (or as guilty as I normally feel when I’m not being productive) and spend time creating with my housemates.
