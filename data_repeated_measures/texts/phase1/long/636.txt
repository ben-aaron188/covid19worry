I feel very anxious that life will never get back to normal. My partner has already had the virus and seems to be out the other end now so I am not worried about getting it, I am more concerned about the impact on the economy going forwards and how small businesses will cope.
I am worried about my parents as they are in their 70s and self isolating, I wish I was able to see them and it makes me sad that we are separated. I am also concerned about job security and that I may lose my job or have to take a pay cut,
